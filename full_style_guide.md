# Official Style Guide

### About this Guide

**About this Guide**

**The CBC's multiplatform English Language Guide gives all staff one-stop shopping for style and usage queries. It is regularly updated.** Launched in February 2010 by the Office of the Vice-President of English Services, the Language Guide combines a pronunciation database started by CBC Radio in 1992 with a comprehensive style and usage intranet site created by CBCNews.ca in 2003. It moved to a new home in Google sites in 2017.

**History of language guidelines at the CBC**





**A not-so paperless office**
When the CBC began broadcasting newscasts in the 1930s, typewriters and manually cranked duplicating machines were how we got out the word about words. Pronounce a short vowel sound here. Avoid redundancy there. Generally prefer the active voice. For more than 50 years, a language "supervisor" or "counsellor" issued rulings and reminders, including **William Brodie**, **John Rae**, **Lamont Tilden**, **George Rich** and **Ken Haslam**. Consistency was equated with professionalism, and by the 1960s decisions about what was preferred and what was acceptable applied to all CBC Radio and CBC-TV news staff. Regular in-house notices about English usage were also distributed by the corporation's old Office of Broadcast Language, such as the monthly _You Don't Say_ bulletin between 1975 and 1983.

**The 'Lang File'**
Soon after being appointed the English news service's broadcast language adviser, national radio news host **Russ Germain** brought the whole process into the electronic age. In 1992, he created a Language File (quickly dubbed the "Lang File") in one of the news service's earliest computer networks. For the first time, the adviser's pronunciation rulings and periodic other notes about diction and grammar were instantly available in a permanent bulletin board. As the CBC moved to different computer systems (from Info to Prolog to iNEWS), Germain continued to add entries until his retirement a decade later. Host **Judy Maddren** took over the language adviser's role in 2003 until her retirement in 2009. By the summer of that year, the Lang File had almost 11,000 entries. Most were very brief (a few words to a sentence or two), and almost all of them (more than 95 per cent) dealt with preferred pronunciations only.

**
Language Online**
Before Germain's retirement, it was clear that the CBC needed to expand its approach to language and style guidelines. An explosion of online news at the turn of the millennium had turned Canada's national broadcaster into an electronic publisher, too. In 2003, CBCNews.ca's senior editor of journalistic standards **Blair Shewchuk** created Language Online, an intranet resource that outlined in-house publishing style (from spelling and punctuation to capitalization and use of italics). Unlike the old Lang File, links could be added to internal and external content. Alphabetical lists were also easier to scan and keyword searches were faster. Given web writing and editing needs, Language Online branched out to tackle numerous topics in far more depth (e.g., [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) embedded in English text and the sometimes tricky rules about [whom](/home/w/who-versus-whom)). As online language adviser, Shewchuk also worked with Germain and Maddren on various CBC News style preferences — ensuring that rulings were consistent across platforms.

**New era of news integration**
The first steps to create a central Language Guide on the iO! portal were taken at the end of 2009. The news service's move toward greater integration between radio, television and web platforms, combined with the revamping of its iNEWS computer system, presented an opportunity to marry the Lang File with Language Online. The best content from each was combined to create a new Language Guide that offered editorial staff far more than either of the previous word warehouses did alone. **Esther Enkin** was named chair of a newly created [CBC Language Advisory Committee](/language-advisory-committee) that would periodically review guidelines and issue recommendations for all English Services. **Blair Shewchuk** was appointed the committee's senior language counsellor as well as standards editor for CBC News, reporting directly to Enkin.

Since the old Lang File was primarily a pronunciation directory full of unverified spellings of proper names and other words, its content was transferred to a [special database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2FIndex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2p5Bo2D4gXWwBfXu8gqKe3) created by the CBC's IT and iO! departments. This meant that broadcast staff could still look up 20 years' worth of phonetic preferences, only more quickly. In addition, audio files could now be added to make certain pronunciation preferences much easier to convey.

At the same time, a new Language Guide was built on the foundation of Language Online, CBCNews.ca's style and usage intranet site, which already had thousands of entries that had been carefully spellchecked and copy edited over the years, and which generally dealt with grammar, syntax, word choice, etc., in more depth. Lang File entries unrelated to pronunciation (about 500) were reviewed. Content that was still current and not already in Language Online was flagged. Some old pages were revised to reflect the new guide's multimedia nature, and numerous new entries were added, including a summary of how [CBC News style](/cbc-news-style) is now determined. Improved page design and site navigation was created.

**Going gung-ho with Google**
Half a decade later, aging servers and increasingly archaic software retired by Microsoft meant that the Language Guide needed to be moved to a new publishing platform. A Google site was created, and hundreds of files containing thousands of entries were transferred to the new home. HTML had to be manually rewritten so all of the content would be displayed properly — from every comma, colon and French accent to all italics and bold lettering. Hundreds of internal and external links also had to be recoded to continue to work. It was a challenging project, painstakingly undertaken by **Émilie Sorel** in Montreal.

In September of 2017, the new Google site was launched with Shewchuk still at the helm. Benefits included a quicker way to update content and a faster way to search for keywords. But the most significant improvement was letting all staff more easily access the Language Guide from anywhere. VPN accounts or other special security steps were no longer required outside the corporation's firewall. Instead, a CBC Google password matching an employee's existing GMail password was sufficient.

**Embracing Umbraco**
In the fall of 2021, the Language Guide was on the move again, this time to a content management system called Umbraco. Changes at Google had started hampering functionality and the CBC's Technology and Infrastructure Department wanted more control over publishing tools used on the corporation's intranet. The new platform also improved how text was displayed on mobile devices. Once again, the switch involved months of coding and design work, led by **Sébastien Thibaut** and **Émilie Sorel** in Montreal.

Since spoken and written English continue to evolve, the CBC Language Guide is expected to remain a constant work in progress — with new terms added, and old entries reviewed and revised (or deleted), as required.

### CBC News Style

The term "style" actually has several meanings, from distinct voice (writing style) to specific font and layout (design style). In our Language Guide, **style refers to English usage — including spelling, pronunciation, punctuation, capitalization, grammar, diction (word choice), etc.**

**What is CBC News style?**
**We follow a wide range of in-house guidelines when broadcasting words on air or publishing text online.** Sometimes only one approach is considered accurate (a particular spelling or pronunciation) or literate (a certain choice of word or rule of grammar) or in the best interest of our audience (avoiding a term or phrase that suggests bias or is too easily misunderstood). At other times, it's a case of picking one of several options and sticking with it to maintain the professional shine of consistency in our journalism.

**The most common CBC News style categories are:**

**1\. Journalistic choices, editorial caveats**

> Examples: Picking [Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar) over Burma in first reference. Using "[Dr.](/home/d/dr)" for licensed health-care professionals only, not people with PhDs. Acknowledging [proprietary names](/home/t/trade-names), such as Frisbee and Velcro, with appropriate capitalization. Staying as neutral as possible with labels such as [pro-choice and anti-abortion](/home/a/abortion). Avoiding use of [fundamentalist](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist) alone as a synonym for "extremist" or "militant."

**2\. Adherence to 'standard English'**

> Examples: Using correct pronoun case, such as [I and me](/home/i/i-versus-me). Maintaining [subject-verb agreements](/home/v/verb-agreement). Retaining distinctions between words such as [affect and effect](/home/a/affect-versus-effect), [lay versus lie](/home/l/lay-versus-lie) and [Maritime versus Atlantic](/home/a/atlantic-versus-maritime) provinces. Avoiding widely condemned usage, such as the illogic of [irregardless](/home/i#irregardless) and the misuse of [begs the question](/home/b/begs-the-question).

**3\. Pronunciation preferences**   

> Examples: Rhyming [Moscow](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D34108&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0scY4HXAwrRnY2rqYdzANt) with "no" rather than "now," putting emphasis on the first syllable in [kilometre](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D31685&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1AwZsZsmFYIQvn1IEVw7ld) (matching centimetre rather than thermometer), adding an "f" sound to [lieutenant](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D35060&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2iNGIuba0RLTuuzHA_-K0e) and pronouncing the last syllable of [missile](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D28354&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2GHHooMvhxQe7N-NIteZCf) along the lines of "mile" rather than "mill." All preferences are found in a [special pronunciation database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2FIndex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2p5Bo2D4gXWwBfXu8gqKe3).

**4\. Spelling preferences**

> Examples: Using [Canadian spellings](/home/s/spelling) such as "[colour](/home/s/spelling/our)" and "[centre](/home/c/centre-versus-center)" except in proper nouns (e.g., World Trade Center), adding an extra "c" to raccoon, doubling the "l" in words such as fuelling and following entrenched [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) (e.g., al-Qaeda rather than al Qaida).

**5\. Typographical preferences (punctuation, capitalization, etc.)**

> Examples: Dropping periods from uppercase [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations#uppercase) (RCMP, AIDS) unless geographical (P.E.I., B.C.), generally putting [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) outside closing punctuation, limiting our use of [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) and keeping most [titles](/home/t/titles) lowercase (mayor) unless directly in front of the person's name (Mayor Mary Wong) Since the early days of web publishing in the 1990s, our typography has adhered to what we call a "[modified CP style](/home/s/spelling/modified-cp-style)."


**Why does it matter?**

We're the country's public broadcaster, and **Canadians expect us to know and follow standard English**. Since the CBC began broadcasting news in the 1930s, people have been less than shy about contacting us over mistakes in grammar, syntax, pronunciation, etc. With the introduction of web publishing, complaints have rapidly broadened to include slips in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. The level of scrutiny has also intensified. Online audiences can now read and reread sentences at their leisure, spotting mistakes more easily and challenging any wording with the click of a button.

**Establishing and following a CBC News style is important for several reasons:**

-   **Editorial control**
    **Internal guidelines help the CBC as a whole maintain editorial control over its journalism and other content.** Instead of relying solely on external sources (e.g., the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, which may be silent on various new proper nouns in the news, or the most recent Canadian Press style manual, which may include various entries that clash with established CBC News rulings), the corporation sets its own approach to words such as [terrorist](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) and [jihad](/home/j/jihad), decides how to handle disputed terms such as [Nagorno-Karabakh](/home/n/nagorno-karabakh) and [Sea of Japan/East Sea](/home/s/sea-of-japan_east-sea), outlines special parameters around the reporting of [polls](/home/p/polls), etc.


-   **Credibility**
    **Mispronouncing or misspelling the name of a person, organization, etc., makes our journalism poorer. If we can't get that part of the story right, people begin to wonder what else we've botched.** Careful word choice falls into this category, too. Distinguishing between [percentage and per cent](/home/p/per-cent-versus-percentage), [viruses and bacteria](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) and [Ponzi versus pyramid](/home/p/ponzi-versus-pyramid-scheme) schemes are all examples of valuing accuracy. When we make a special effort to get things right we build trust. And trust is the foundation of the CBC News brand.
-   **Consistency**
    **In some cases, in-house style boils down to consistency rather than correctness.** When more than one approach is acceptable ([Londonderry](/home/l/londonderry-versus-london) versus Derry, [backward](/home/w/ward-versus-wards) versus backwards, certain [imperial versus metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) measurements), it's important to have a plan in place. Amateurishly bouncing an audience from one style to the next on a whim (in line skates, in-line skates and inline skates), leaves people wondering if decisions depend on the employee, the day of the week or the position of the planets. By contrast, **following a central style** (in-line skates) **telegraphs a level of professionalism appropriate for a national network.**
-   **Speed / Productivity**
    **In addition to meeting audience expectations of professionalism, internal language guidelines help our journalists and other staff do their jobs more efficiently.** Production speed is increased because databases of preferred pronunciations, spellings, etc., can be quickly consulted as deadlines loom. There’s also a system in place for requesting rulings not already covered. As well, internal guidelines increase the efficiency of retrieving archived stories later because search engines are able to rely on consistent spellings of keywords.


**How is our style set?**
As chair of the CBC [Language Advisory Committee](/language-advisory-committee), **Journalistic Standards and Public Trust Director George Achi has overall responsibility for language usage across the English networks** — normally making final rulings on difficult or sensitive editorial guidelines (e.g., [suicide reporting](/home/s/suicide) and the use of [oilsands](/home/o/oilsands-versus-tarsands) versus tarsands). **The JSP director regularly consults the news service's senior standards adviser** and others as required.

**All routine style decisions unrelated to pronunciation are made by the senior standards adviser, who also manages the Language Guide** on behalf of the JSP Office. Rulings cover everything from spelling, punctuation and capitalization preferences to grammatical strictness or latitude (e.g., recommending "Who did you see?" over the stilted and unnatural "Whom did you see?" on the grounds of what's known as the "[interrogative who](/home/w/who-versus-whom#interrogatives)") and other debatable usage (e.g., [media are](/home/l/latin-plurals) rather than media is). **The senior standards adviser also works with colleagues from different platforms drafting various guidelines** (e.g., how and when to censor [offensive language in our online coverage](/home/o/offensive-language)), which are then given to the chair for approval.

**In August 2022, a new Language Advisory Group was formed** as part of the new service's pledge to broaden consultation and to make CBC Language Guide style decisions more inclusive. It's made up of roughly a dozen employees from across the country who serve on a rotational basis for periods of generally no more than two years. They're asked for input on a range of words and phrases that are being debated for various reasons, from newly coined terms to old style manual entries under review. The group's recommendations are then submitted to the JSP Office for consideration. 

**Pronunciation preferences are determined by veteran journalist [Laura Carlin](/language-advisory-committee#Laura)** and other colleagues, chosen by the JSP Office, who regularly update a [special pronunciation database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2FIndex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2p5Bo2D4gXWwBfXu8gqKe3) started by former broadcast language adviser Russ Germain in the early 1990s. (A brief history of CBC's language advisers can be found in the [About this guide](/about-this-guide) overview.)


**Research and consultation: Primary sources**
CBC journalists are expected to find out and use the correct spellings and pronunciations of proper nouns (e.g., the names of people, companies, products, government agencies) and other words (e.g., terms from the worlds of science, business, arts, sports) in stories they're working on. It's important to collect this information in the field and include it in scripts.

**Always check this Language Guide** (or in the case of pronunciations our special database) **first, to see if a news service preference has been set.** For general spelling and pronunciation guidance after that, our main dictionary is the [Canadian Oxford](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfordreference.com%2Fviews%2FBOOK_SEARCH.html%3Fbook%3Dt150%26subject%3Ds7%26authstatuscode%3D200&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2j5dtl21fzPGOBeXVVJOBv) (2004, second edition), available to all staff online for free through a corporate subscription. When more than one acceptable spelling is listed and a clear preference is not indicated, the Canadian Oxford Spelling book is consulted (e.g., use "adviser" instead of "advisor") but not always followed (e.g., we and numerous other large news agencies, including CP, continue to prefer "tuque" over "toque" for the knitted cap). See also the separate overviews on [Spelling](/home/s/spelling) and [Pronunciation](/handy-links/pronunciation) for specific guidance on handling words with alternative entries.

Our primary reference tool for the names of Canadian cities, towns, villages, mountains, lakes, rivers, etc., is the federal government's comprehensive [Canadian Geographical Names Service database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fname.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ZKjLC72PeNFm20h4xsLKO). Since all provinces and territories contribute to the CGNS's official spellings, entries are generally undisputed. A few exceptions have been identified over the years (e.g., the [St. John River](/home/s/st-saint-ste#StJohnsRiver) rather than the Saint John River in New Brunswick) based on widely established convention or entrenched local preference, and these have been incorporated into the Language Guide's A to Z directory as part of CBC News style. See also the [Provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) overview for a list of communities in Canada that are widely enough known to be mentioned on their own without the need to identify the province for a national audience.

Our primary source for geographical names outside of Canada not already listed in this Language Guide is the National Geographic Atlas of the World, which is also used by The Canadian Press and The Associated Press. Exceptions that are established as CBC News style are listed in the A to Z index (e.g., Kabul not "Kabol," Damascus not "Dimashq," and Rome not "Roma"). See also the [Geographical abbreviations](/home/g/geography-cities) overview for a list of cities around the world that are widely enough known to be mentioned on their own without the need to include the country.

**When making rulings or recommendations, the standards editor often consults internal and external authorities**, depending on how urgently a decision is needed. Experts on certain topics may be asked for input — including the heads of different "content teams" (e.g., sports, business, health, technology, the environment). Various reference material may also be reviewed, including:

**When is our style revised?**
**Language Guide entries are not added, deleted or revised on a whim. But all entries are subject to review.** We stand firm when no solid evidence is presented that our style is wrong or poorer than an alternative. We revise when errors are spotted or if improvements are needed — based on new information, established new usage or evidence that a different approach is better for our audience (e.g., clearer).

**The two chief reasons for shifts in CBC News style:**

**
1\. New information surfaces**
**Sometimes an old preference turns out to be inaccurate, dated, etc.** Examples are revised proper nouns, especially businesses (Stelco became U.S. Steel Canada in 2007) and certain [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) (Peking became Beijing in the 1980s, and Chernobyl became Chornobyl in the 1990s). We are no strangers to leading the way when a new preference makes sense. CBC News, for example, replaced Nfld. with [N.L.](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador) as the abbreviation for Newfoundland and Labrador before The Canadian Press.

It's worth noting that official but secondary sources can prove unreliable, especially for people's names. For instance, Olympic champion speed skater Catriona Le May Doan's official website spelled her name "LeMay" for a long time, and required inquiries by the CBC to confirm that there's a space between Le and May. This was also true of the Governor General's website, which originally spelled the name of Michaëlle Jean's daughter without an accent (Marie-Eden instead of the correct Marie-Éden) until CBC News asked for clarification in 2005. The best way to find out how to pronounce or spell someone's name is to ask the person directly. If that's not possible, consult a relative or someone else close to the individual.


**2\. Usage evolves**
Centuries ago, the word "nice" meant "ignorant" and people pronounced the "k" in "knife" and "knee." We used a more complex system of pronouns (e.g., "thou" for singular and "ye" for plural, instead of plain old "you"). When William Strunk's classic The Elements of Style was first published in 1918, we were told to put hyphens in the words today, tonight and tomorrow ("to-day, to-night and to-morrow"). As recently as 2000, the fourth edition of the same book embraced the word "summarize" as useful while quirkily dismissing the rather common and practical term "finalize" as an abomination. Language changes. Sometimes slowly, over generations, and sometimes much more quickly. But as long as it's spoken and written (English is alive, Latin is dead), a **language evolves. And a news service's style must adjust accordingly, or it risks morphing from a current and valuable set of guidelines into a charming relic of past usage.**

From the CBC's first news broadcasts, memos have circulated about grammar, word choice, clear writing and correct pronunciation. Some of the old guidelines stand the test of time. For example, notes from the early 1940s said don't put a definite article ("the") in front of HMS or you wind up with "the His Majesty's Ship," and don't refer to contract disputes as "labour" unrest, because it emphasizes only one side of labour-management relations. Current style still reflects these early rulings (see [HMCS](/home/h/hmcs) and [labour dispute](/home/l#labourdispute)).

Other advice, however, seems rather odd now based on how English is used today. For example, CBC language notes from the 1930s insisted on avoiding possessives with inanimate objects (e.g., rewrite "the car's guards" as "the men guarding the car"), and on always using honorifics "for well-known and respected persons." The minister of agriculture was cited as a respected person, while Hitler and Stalin were identified as people who shouldn't have "Mr." in front of their names. In the 1960s, CBC News style guides baldly stated that the word "prestigious" meant "deceptive or illusory" rather than "with prestige" — a common view among usage sticklers at the time. A generation later, anyone trying to convey the idea of "deception" with the word "prestigious" would be misunderstood. (For a closer look at "prestigious" and some other cases of evolving meaning, see the CBCNews.ca Words: Woe & Wonder column [Static over style](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fstatic_style.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0XSJ_Nui63qTVeXLxPvLMw) from December 2000.)


**Keeping CBC News style current**
**While there's no doubt that English evolves, the tricky part is deciding when and how to revise our style based on changing usage.** Such decisions can be relatively subjective. If change is called for and not deemed controversial, the new service's standards editor often makes independent rulings to keep our style current. Routine pronunciation calls are made by on-air staff with delegated authority. When the need for change is debatable or a particular style point is potentially controversial (including a spelling or pronunciation preference), the full Language Advisory Committee is generally consulted. **When a decision involves setting new and sensitive editorial policy or shifting current editorial policy in a major way, the committee's chair makes the final ruling.**

Throughout the process, **your input is encouraged. The Language Guide is everyone's resource. If you think a preference is wrong or dated, please go to the [Contact Us](/contact-us) page to pass on your concern or to share any other suggestions.**

### Pronunciation FAQs

**Pronunciation FAQs**

CBC News pronunciation preferences are stored in a [special database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XFPfiGVRPwO63-NkaNyUm) that's separate from the main Language Guide's server. **You need to go to the database first to search for entries.** This page answers 10 frequently asked questions, starting with why we use [**SPELLED-OUT PHONETICS**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/521ind0l/cbc-phonetics-legend_september-2017.pdf "CBC PHONETICS LEGEND_September-2017.pdf").

**1\. Are international phonetic symbols used?**
No. To aid comprehension, "sounds like" or "rhymes with" guidelines are used rather than international phonetic symbols (e.g, SAY, SEE and SEYE rather than "eɪ" and "aɪ" and "i:"). This follows a tradition started at CBC Radio more than half a century ago. Most people simply haven't memorized the dozens of different international symbols (Λ = _u_  in _run_, u: = _oo_  in _mood_, Φ = _th_  in _thin_ ) that represent all possible consonant and vowel sounds of the English language. Similar "sounds like" guidelines are used by many reputable reference books, including the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage. To underscore syllabic emphasis, capital letters and/or the apostrophe sign appear ('KILL-oh-mee-ter). **Our [PHONETICS LEGEND](https://docs.google.com/a/cbc.ca/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2JjLmNhfGxhbmd1YWdlZ3VpZGV8Z3g6NzQxNzEyNzFhYjI3ZWZlYw) outlines the basics for writing clear "pronouncers" in television and radio scripts.**

**2\. How do I search the database?**
Entering a keyword in the search engine (e.g., _Hitler_) is the fastest way to find content. A list of entries containing that word will appear. In this case, the preferred pronunciation of Hitler's first name is "AH-dawlf" rather than "AY-dawlf," based on historical accuracy and vowel sound entrenchment. You can also scan through alphabetical lists of all entries in the database. To speed up scrolling, electronic bookmarks have been created so you can jump to specific spots within a given A to Z directory (e.g., a-ak, al-ap and aq-az). For more details and examples, see the Language Guide's [search tips](/search-tips).

**3\. What's included?**
The database features thousands of pronunciations. Most of the entries are proper nouns (in particular, the names of people, geographical locations and organizations) in the news. There are also preferred CBC pronunciations for generic words ([kilometre](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D31685&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2oXAGFEu3itdTRV_AwXs4L), [lieutenant](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D35060&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0bx5don-5st3Ogst__FMl4)) established over time. New entries are regularly added. To keep the database from becoming overly large, priority is given to names or terms that are commonly mispronounced, are not already listed in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, are confusing because more than one pronunciation is listed in the dictionary, etc.

**4\. How are preferences determined, and how do I suggest a new entry or a change in style?**
CBC journalists are expected to find out and use proper spellings and pronunciations in the stories they're working on, and to include these in their scripts. This is the database's foundation. In the case of unclear or disputed pronunciations of other words, **the CBC Language Advisory Committee's chief pronunciation counsellor [Laura Carlin](/language-advisory-committee#Laura)** issues rulings. She and colleagues with designated authority also add, delete and revise content in the Pronunciation Database. Periodically, requests to relax or change certain preferred pronunciations are reviewed by a panel of veteran CBC broadcasters from across the country chosen by the counsellor. See also FAQs [9](#FAQ9) and [10](#FAQ10) below for related information on non-English pronunciations, multiple pronunciations, etc.

**5\. Are there audio files?**
 Yes. The Language Guide's Pronunciation Database supports audio.
It was not realistic to create MP3 files for the thousands of existing pronunciations copied from the old, text-based systems (Info, Prolog and iNEWS). But sound was added to a few dozen words when the database was launched (e.g., [Port-au-Prince](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D31773&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3Jw37Sn7lFxO7REaN7THY6), [harass](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D37452&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3XzlANo568T1JB4Uyopclx), [junta](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D26941&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ryoDvkn-uCoVOn_iqE67F), [Moscow](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D34108&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw27K-4VzdjGtGqER_LrvuNB) and [missile](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D28354&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3BFc0cILu04uP08VOevtKL)). As new entries are posted, the plan is to record and attach audio files whenever possible. This will make it easier to convey specific pronunciation preferences. A small icon indicates that an entry has sound. To play the audio, click on the arrow.

**6\. Is this database the same as the old 'Lang File'?**
Most of it — at least initially. As pointed out in a [historical review](/about-this-guide) of language guidelines at the CBC, more than 95 per cent of the old iNEWS Lang File was made up of pronunciation preferences compiled over two decades. Approximately 10,500 entries were moved into the new web-based Pronunciation Database in December 2009. The only content not included dealt with topics beyond pronunciation (e.g., various grammar and craft tips). These were reviewed separately and added to the new Language Guide if still current and if similar entries did not already exist. As the new pronunciation database grows, and as various phonetic tips are reviewed and potentially revised or deleted (if no longer relevant to daily news coverage), the similarity to the old Lang File is expected to fade.

**7\. Are spellings confirmed?**
Not unless specified. Since the old "Lang File" entries were written for broadcast staff only, virtually none of the original 10,500 pronunciation entries were checked for spelling. In many cases, the keywords were also written in all-uppercase letters — making it impossible to tell what needs to be capitalized and what doesn’t. Therefore, anyone consulting old entries in the database should not rely on the information for web news stories. Instead, they should check other sources, beginning with the main CBC News Language Guide. (For example: The answer to [FAQ 2](/handy-links/pronunciation#FAQ1) above cites a preferred pronunciation of Hitler's first name. There are also several common spellings. For consistency, CBC News uses the historically entrenched _Adolf_ rather than _Adolph_.) Whenever possible, new pronunciation entries will include verified spellings. In these cases, the "Spelling confirmed" field will be marked "Yes."

**8\. Why are pronunciations in their own database?**
For technical and editorial reasons. On the technical side, creating a separate database was the most practical way to move the old "Lang File" content to a web-based format in 2009. Automated migration meant that more than 10,000 individual pages did not need to be individually coded with HTML. On the editorial side, creating a special database meant that people could more easily look for pronunciations. It also meant that thousands of "Lang File" pronunciation entries would not need to be edited for spelling, consistent CBC News publishing style (capitalization, punctuation), etc. An effective Language Guide must model in-house style and usage. A pronunciation database, by contrast, can still serve its primary function using phonetic spellings and unorthodox typography.

**9\. How do we handle non-English words (names, generic words, etc.)?**
We respect known preferences when saying people's names. However, we also keep in mind that CBC News reports in English. Our journalists are not expected to try to mimic all vowel and consonant sounds of a different language (i.e., to attempt to report in Arabic, German, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, etc.). If CBC News employees happen to be bilingual or multilingual, of course, then it's perfectly natural for them to switch from English to another language and back again. Otherwise, however, we generally strive for the "Canadian English" pronunciation of a given name, generic word, etc. This means we adopt versions that take into account non-English phonetics while encouraging consistency and familiarity, especially when anglicized forms are entrenched (e.g., we do not say "Paris" or "Mexico" the ways local residents would). Furthermore, it's been our experience that citizens of a given country all speaking the same language can pronounce things in slightly different ways — including how someone from Newfoundland, Saskatchewan or Ontario says "Toronto." Regional dialects, educational backgrounds, personal enunciation patterns, can all affect speech. So we need to be cautious when told by a source that there's only one, definitive way to pronounce the name of a non-English town, city, island, river, etc. Tips on how to say [Japanese names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2011/2011-03-19/ "2011 03 19") and [Ukrainian names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2022/2022-03-01/ "2022 03 01") illustrate our typical approach.

**10\. Do we want everyone on air to sound the same?**
No. We certainly want to be accurate, which means when there's only one way to say something correctly (e.g., if someone's name is known to have a specific long vowel sound) we need to get it right every time. And we also want to reflect [conventional Canadian preferences](/home/a/americanisms) (e.g., putting an "f" in _lieutenant_ and rhyming the prefixes "_anti-_" and "_semi-_" with "BEE" rather than "BYE"). Of course, sometimes established preferences are eventually broadened to include two or more equally acceptable approaches. When that happens, we celebrate the country's diverse dialects, as long as each pronunciation is well enough entrenched to fall into the general category of standard Canadian English (e.g., _schedule_ can be "SKED-jool" or "SHED-yool," and either can be "EE-ther" or "EYE-ther").

For more on the challenge of pronouncing words in a way that's "educated" but not elitist, including the long-standing debate over how to say kilometre, see an excerpt from the April 2000 Russ Germain column, [The ABCs of CBC Pronunciation](/handy-links/pronunciation/the-abcs-of-cbc-pronunciation).

### The ABCs of CBC Pronunciation


**The ABCs of CBC Pronunciation**
**by Russ Germain**, former CBC Broadcast Language Adviser
(Excerpt from an April 2000 column)


On one of our newscasts not so long ago, a network announcer pronounced the AIDS drug AZT as "Ay Zee Tee." The calls came in fast and furious. Canadians don't say _Zee_, they say _Zed_. Make no mistake, we are not American. We've heard similar complaints about other influences from south of the border over the years: quayz-eye for _quasi_; sem-eye for _semi_; ant-eye for _anti_; OH-fence for _offense_; MISS-ill for _missile_; rowt for _route_ (a pathway) rather than for _rout_ (a decisive defeat). The list is long.

Many Canadians regard the CBC as the keeper of their mother tongue. Many others whose first language is not English but, rather, any one of the dozens of others heard in Canada today also turn to the CBC as a definitive source of English — English they expect to hear spoken by educated Canadians. In this sense, these citizens and immigrants use the public broadcaster as a guide....

Exactly who decides what language is right and what isn't on CBC airwaves? Certainly our listeners, readers and viewers have a great deal of influence. If they can't understand what we're trying to say or don't feel we are speaking in their own "Canadian English," then we are not communicating as well as we are supposed to.

But before we go any further, let's differentiate between two kinds of speech you hear on the CBC. The first is extemporaneous or unrehearsed conversation. This can be heard, for example, in an interview, a phone-in show or a debate. The second is speech that is formal, or written and edited before it is aired in, say, a newscast or documentary.

In the first case, we cannot expect people to speak perfectly all the time off the tops of their heads. That would be an almost impossible standard to achieve, let alone maintain. Even professional broadcasters are human, after all. Nevertheless, our on-air journalists are expected to have a better than average command of English. And in the completely scripted language of newscasts, news reports, or documentaries, our listeners should hear speech that conforms to the best possible usage....

If listeners, viewers and readers are part of our quality control, what are they telling us? Many stress the importance of the fundamental rules of grammar.... Some people write or phone to challenge sloppy enunciation. For example, hundred (not _hundert_), picture (not _pitchure_), February (does anyone say _Febrooary_ anymore?), et cetera, (not _eck cetera_). Then there are the pronunciations that everyone agrees to disagree about. Is it _shedule_ or _skedule_, _skallop_ or _skawlop_, _eether_ or _eyether_, _staytus_ or _stahtus_, _dayta_ or _dahta_, ant or _awnt_? It all depends on where you're from and what you learned in school — _er, shool_.

Perhaps the longest-running battle over pronunciation at the CBC is the word _kilometre_. When Canada adopted the metric system of measurement in 1970, it established a metric commission to guide implementation. The commissioners included pronunciation of the various units of measurement as part of their mandate. The rule was simple: Units of measurement had primary stress on the first syllable; KILL-oh-gram, KILL-oh-watt, KILL-oh-pass-kal and KILL-oh-mee-ter. The suffix is spelled _metre_. Instruments of measurement on the other hand have primary stress on the second syllable: spee-DAW-meh-ter, bah-RAW-meh-ter, ther-MAW-meh-ter, etc. The suffix is spelled _meter_.

But to this day, many Canadians continue to pronounce kilometre as kih-LAW-meh-ter. This pronunciation defines it as an instrument of measurement, not as a unit of measurement. Almost all dictionaries show kih-LAW-meh-ter as acceptable because its popular use has been documented enough times. But in such cases, the CBC strongly advises its broadcasters to embrace the pronunciation used by informed or educated Canadians — that is, those who have been trained in science and technology.

More than once an editor has tried to argue that insisting on KILL-oh-mee-ter over kih-LAW-meh-ter — or any other "proper" language — amounts to linguistic elitism. "My listeners don't speak that way in their everyday lives," they say. Perhaps not. But is it the CBC's mandate to simply reflect clichéd, popular jargon as our preferred method of communication? If we buy that argument, we're in danger of supporting the position that education in general is elitist.

On one hand Canadians expect us to subscribe to popular usage, not to talk down to them or talk over their heads; to be real. On the other, they expect us to aim for the highest linguistic common factor, not the lowest common denominator. For those who care passionately about the language, it's no small challenge to find the right balance.

See [Pronunciation FAQs](/handy-links/pronunciation) for general principles and guidelines.
Go to the **[CBC PRONUNCIATION DATABASE](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2FLNG%2FRecherche%2FIndex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2p5Bo2D4gXWwBfXu8gqKe3)** for an alphabetical list of more than 12,000 phonetic preferences dating back decades.

**Punctuation**

The architecture of written English is remarkably varied. Although there's consensus over when to write "its" (a pronoun) and "it's" (a contraction), language authorities have their own preferences — some wildly idiosyncratic — for a myriad of other matters, including decisions about capital letters, hyphens, ellipses and commas.

Strunk and White's steadfastly popular the Elements of Style, for instance, recommends another comma in the last sentence of the first paragraph (after the word "ellipses"). But we and most other major news services in North America don't bother with the final comma in a series unless the last element includes a conjunction. This is known as the "bacon and eggs" rule. (See [commas](/handy-links/punctuation/commas))

For consistency, CBC News follows a [modified Canadian Press style](/home/s/spelling/modified-cp-style). **Each page below lists the key guidelines about a given point of typography.** The longest entries deal with apostrophes, commas, ellipses and quotation marks.

### Apostrophes

**Apostrophes**

**Avoid mixing up contractions** (it's) **and pronouns** ([its](/home/i/its-versus-its)).

**Avoid confusing closing single quotation marks** (') **with possessive apostrophes**. (See [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) and [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for relevant guidelines.)

**Treat possessive apostrophes as part of a word.** Do not insert a comma, period or other punctuation between the apostrophe and the word (e.g., The other dog was the Smiths', court was told). But be aware that recasting is sometimes preferable (Court was told that the Smiths owned the other dog).

**Check proper nouns you're not sure about.** For example: It's Queen's University, Maclean's magazine, Ottawa 67's (hockey team), Hudson's Hope, B.C., and Burk's Falls, Ont., but Hells Angels, Rhodes Scholar, San Francisco 49ers, Brights Grove, Ont., Shirleys Bay, Ont., and St. Catharines, Ont.

**Generally add an "s" to form a plural, even when the word already ends with the letter "s"** (Charles's, Eves's, James's, a witness's, the press's, etc.) See [s' versus s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s)

**Use apostrophes rather than hyphens or other punctuation to indicate when individual letters form verbs** (e.g., X'd out the text, X'ing and O'ing her way to the tick-tack-toe championship).

**Add apostrophes to plural forms of INDIVIDUAL letters, whether lowercase or capitalized** (p's and q's, X's and O's, three A's and two B's on a report card, the Oakland A's). **This applies to SINGLE letters of the alphabet only**, not to clusters of letters or other characters (e.g., ABCs, FAQs, MPs, 747s). See [abbreviations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/abbreviations/#singleletters "Abbreviations") for detailed guidelines and examples.

**Use figures to label decades:** the 1930s, the '30s, the Dirty '30s (not Thirties).

**Do not put apostrophes before the "s" in the plural forms of years** (1980s, 1920s, mid-1940s). Also, generally treat a decade as a descriptive adjective rather than a true possessive (a 1950s radio).

**Abbreviate years with apostrophes when seeking an informal tone** (the '70s), **but not when referring to an official name that doesn't include the punctuation** (Expo 67, Expo 86). See also [World Fair versus world fair](/home/w/world-fair)

**Avoid treating unambiguous attributive nouns as possessives** (the Leafs' first loss of the season but a Leafs player, NOT a "Leafs' player") See [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)

### Brackets

**Round ( ) versus square \[ \] brackets**





**Parentheses (an overview)**
**Extra detail is usually added to sentences with the simple use of commas:**

> Williams, also known the Splendid Splinter, never made more than $150,000 a season.

**But parentheses work just as well (or better) from time to time:**

> Ted (Splendid Splinter) Williams never made more than $150,000 a season.


(See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames))

**Use brackets sparingly.** They stand out in copy, so too many of them in one story are distracting. They can also leave readers with the impression of tentativeness. (Why isn't the writer being more direct? Why all the asides?)

And they can sometimes block the flow of a story, making it harder to read. Long sentences held up in large part by brackets usually signal the need for a rewrite.


**Round Brackets ( )**
**Outside directly transcribed quotations, brackets should always be round:**

> The south pole on Mars was 148 K (–125 C) last month.


Although there's no point including Kelvin and Celsius readings in most stories, the sentence above might work well in a science feature on the history of the Kelvin scale.

> She worked at the Des Moines (Iowa) Register before moving to Canada in 1997.


Adding the state in brackets helps identify where the woman worked. If the city was not part of a proper noun (i.e., the newspaper's name), we would simply put the word Iowa after a comma:

> She worked at a newspaper in Des Moines, Iowa, before moving to Canada in 1997.


**Square Brackets** \[ \]
**Always use square brackets \[ \] to identify anything we've added to transcribed quotations.** This helps our readers know whether the words are CBCNews.ca's insertion or merely an aside by the speaker or writer we’re quoting:

> "Lawrence \[Janet Cooper’s husband\] ran off the stage," Anderson testified. "That’s when I heard the gunshot."
>
> "As I recall (although my memory is going), they booed John Crosbie \[then federal fisheries minister\] until he finally gave them the finger and stormed away," Manchester wrote in her 1989 memoirs.


This applies to definitions we add, such as spelled-out abbreviations, that would normally be in round brackets. Although the extra content in these cases is almost always immediately understood to be information provided by us, it's still important to use square brackets for consistency. That way, no one is left wondering what's been added to the original quote. The punctuation makes it clear.

> "After four consecutive Conservative budgets, it is clear that the current government has failed to live up to its 2006 election promise to move Canadian aid performance toward the OECD \[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\] average donor spending levels," Fowler said.


Add information only if it helps readers. Avoid unnecessary asides. In a quote about "eight to 10 inches of snow," for example, there's little point inserting a metric conversion in square brackets. Since the amount of snow is already well understood, the square brackets unnecessarily spoil the quote's flow. (See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for related guidelines.)


**Brackets and punctuation**
Periods, commas, question marks and so forth may go inside or outside brackets, depending on whether the punctuation applies to the entire sentence or just to the parenthetical words.


**Outside**
**If the brackets enclose an aside that falls within a larger sentence, the punctuation goes on the outside:**

> "We bought new tires for our used car \[a 1955 Chevrolet station wagon\]," he said, "and then drove to B.C."
>
> Bachner always ate at the same Toronto diner. She got to know all the regulars, including a quiet man who never took off his gloves (pianist Glenn Gould).

**Inside**
**If the brackets enclose one or more separate sentences, put the punctuation on the inside:**

> (Health Canada launched the investigation in 1993.)

**Outside and Inside**
**Sometimes combinations are called for. The key is deciding if the punctuation applies to the entire sentence or merely to the words in brackets:**

> The comedian paused for laughter, broke the uncomfortable silence with familiar patter ("Is this mike on?"), and then continued with his standup routine.

**The 'extra' period**
**If a declarative sentence ends with an abbreviation that falls directly before a bracket, a closing period is still required outside the bracket** unless the entire sentence is parenthetical:

> (All three murder suspects were eventually extradited to the U.S.) 
>
> The violinist had 10 honorary doctorates and one earned degree (a B.Mus.).
>
> He preferred euphemisms ("passed on," "no longer with us," etc.).

**Capital letters**
**In general, capital letters are not used inside brackets unless they begin a direct quote:**

> "After waking everyone up \[by screaming 'Air raid!'\], I ran back outside and tried to find Lt. Jordan," McNally said.

### Colons

**Colons**

The ":" sign is **an excellent tool** for web writers because it **allows us to introduce short bursts of text that are easy to read** on computer monitors. (See also [bulleted lists](/home/b/bulleted-list))

**When a colon is used in a sentence, generally use a lowercase word right after it:**

> She took a broad range of courses: chemistry, math, philosophy and art history.


**Use a capital letter only if you want to emphasize a point or introduce a quote:**

> The veteran comedian said he could sum up his success in one word: Timing.
>
> The answer is simple, he said: "Timing."


**Normally, commas introduce short quotes** (one sentence or less). Colons are usually reserved for longer remarks.

**When flush to closing quotation marks, colons always go outside** (i.e., ": rather than :")

(For more examples, see [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks))

**In certain proper nouns, such as film titles, colons can be helpful to set apart secondary detail.** This punctuation is acceptable even when it's not technically part of the original noun, because colons take up less space and are less distracting than alternatives, such as brackets or dashes:

> _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1_     (First reference)
>
> _Deathly Hallows: Part 1_    (Second reference)

### Commas

**Commas**

"Commas don’t seem to inspire shouting matches the way hyphens do," says Bill Walsh, a senior copy editor at the Washington Post. "But opinions on their proper use probably vary even more widely."

**Sometimes, leaving out commas changes the entire sentence. At other times, putting them in is simply a matter of style.** When commas represent a pause in speech, for example, people disagree on the best place to give the eye or ear a rest. Even when they represent a conjunction, such as the word "and," there are debates.

Essayist E.B. White, known for his magazine writing and stories for children, had this to say about his own employer’s approach: "Commas in The New Yorker fall with the precision of knives in a circus act, outlining the victim."

**Here are some rudimentary guidelines:
**
(a) [How many husbands?](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#husbands) (The Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, then arrived.)
(b) [Serial comma killer](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#serial) beyond the "bacon and eggs rule" (The flag was red, blue and green.)
(c) [Conjunctions](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#conjunctions) (The road was dusty, and the sound of chainsaws filled the valley.)
(d) [Adjectives](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#adjectives) (She was a funny, generous woman. He wore an old brown fishing hat.)
(e) [Pileups cause problems](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#pileups) (Avoid too many adjectives and adverbs.)

**For the use of commas in dates** (e.g., Aug. 13, 2003, versus August 2003), **geographical locations** (She was born in Penticton, B.C., in 1978), **etc., see [abbreviations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/abbreviations/ "Abbreviations")**.

For the use of commas in large numbers (e.g., 1,000), see [numbers](/home/n/numbers).


**(a) How many husbands?**
**Put commas around non-defining** (also known as non-restrictive) **parts.** These are parenthetical matters. **They add detail, but removing them would not change the meaning of the sentence. Do not put commas around defining** (also known as restrictive) parts. **These are essential to the sentence’s meaning.**

**
Correct:**

> The professor and **her husband, Angus**, both play in the orchestra.


(The commas flag an aside. In this case, it's what grammarians call an appositive. The proper noun "Angus" refers to the noun "husband" already introduced. The name adds detail but it could be removed and the meaning of the sentence would remain the same.)


**Wrong:**

> The professor and **her husband Angus** both play in the orchestra.


(In this version, the professor has several spouses. Angus is the husband who plays in the orchestra with her.)


**Maybe right, maybe wrong:**

> The professor and **her daughter Anna** both play in the orchestra.


(The professor has more than one daughter, which may be true.)

> The accused entered the room with **his lawyer Billy Bolours**.


(The accused has more than one lawyer, according to this sentence. In some stories this may be true.)

**Defining and non-defining sentence parts** (clauses, phrases and other fragments) **come up in writing a lot**. See also [that versus which](/home/t/that-versus-which)



**(b) Serial comma killer**
Some authorities (including Strunk and White) recommend including a final comma in a string of three or more elements. But CP (and CBC.ca) style is to **leave out the last serial comma (red, blue and green) unless it’s absolutely needed for clarity** (e.g., when the final element is a compound, such as "gin and tonic"). At The Associated Press, **this is known as the "bacon and eggs" rule:**

> They brought food, clothing and a sense of adventure. 
>
> The report focused on interest rates, rising bank fees and merger rules. 
>
> He drank wine, whiskey, and gin and tonic. 
>
> They talked to prosecutors from Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador.



**(c) Conjunctions**
**Generally use commas before conjunctions** (and, but, or, etc.) **if the subject or central theme changes in the next clause:**

> The road was dusty, and the sound of chainsaws filled the valley. 
>
> Some editors are failed writers, but so are most writers. (_T.S. Eliot_) 
>
> I don't enjoy writing, and I certainly would not do it for a living. Some people do, but some people enjoy flagellation. (_Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh_)


**Commas are unnecessary if the subject doesn't change, if the clause after the conjunction is short, or if the conjunction is merely introducing another adjective or other modifier:**

> The road was dusty and bumpy. 
>
> Some editors are failed writers and drunks. 
>
> The children laughed and sang and raised the old man's spirit. 
>
> It is a mistake to think that books have come to stay. The human race did without them for thousands of years and may decide to do without them again. (_E.M. Forster_)



**(d) Crisp, clear descriptions don’t always need commas**
**When commas represent "and" in a compound adjective, leave them IN:**

> a funny, generous woman
>
> a wide-ranging, detailed report


**But if commas wouldn’t normally be replaced by "and" in conversation, generally leave them OUT.** This is almost always true when the adjective’s sequence would seem unnatural reversed:

> a white toy poodle (_a toy white poodle is something else_)
>
> a Canadian shipping magnate (_a shipping Canadian magnate?_)
>
> a 10-speed racing bike (_a racing 10-speed bike?_)


**In the above examples, the modifiers are integral to the noun. You would probably add a comma if another adjective was added** (e.g., a yappy, white toy poodle) **but not always**. The Globe and Mail’s style manual cites the following as tenably acceptable: "He was wearing his battered old canvas fishing hat."

**Writers obviously have latitude, as long as their sentences are clear.** An "old orange juice bottle" is understood immediately. An "orange, juice bottle" means something quite different (i.e., the juice container itself is orange).




**(e) Pileups cause problems**
Although imagery and detail can make a story better, too many adjectives and adverbs hurt the writing. So **as you debate whether to add commas, be sure to avoid adjectival pileups first:**

> "The old, noisy, red and green, fast-moving, foreign-owned diesel locomotive snaked up the mountain, forming the shape of a giant comma as it disappeared into the cold, misty darkness."

### Dash

**Dashes**

We generally prefer commas, but **dashes are ideal when a clause or other fragment in the middle of a sentence already has commas in it:**

> Several provinces and territories have launched legal challenges — including Alberta, B.C. and Quebec — but the federal government says it has no intention of backing down.

**
Dashes can also be handy to avoid ambiguity:**

> The other costs — taxes and legal fees — were lower than projected.


(Using commas in this case wouldn’t make it clear that "taxes and legal fees" were the "other costs.")

**In rare cases, dashes at the end of a quote can represent a speaker being cut off:**

> "I think you should—"


But use "..." instead of "—" if the speaker's voice simply trails away. (See [ellipses](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses) for more details)


**—, – and -**
**Never use hyphens (-) for "em" dashes (—)**, which are about the width of a capital M, or **"en" dashes (–)**, which are about the width of a capital N.

**Use long** ("em") **dashes whenever demarcating part of a sentence.**

**Use slightly shorter** ("en") **dashes for the minus sign in temperatures. Type these flush to the figure:**

_–15 C_ or –15 degrees (when Celsius is implied)

See also [temperatures](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#temperatures)


**Proper nouns**
**Generally avoid dashes in proper nouns. Prefer hyphens instead.** For instance, if a title includes a time period with an "en dash" ("1995–2010") or a longer "em" dash ("1995—2010"), there's no need to match the typography exactly. Instead, a hyphen is OK ("1995-2010").

**This use of hyphens also applies to [electoral districts](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#electoraldistricts)** (e.g., Dartmouth-Cole Harbour, Mississauga-Streetsville).

**HTML code**
**The HTML code for an em dash is &#8212;**.

> "Dash it all. I prefer em dashes."
>
> — Dashiell Hammettnot, 1946


**The HTML code for an en dash is &#8211;**

But avoid adding manual, unauthorized HTML code to CBC News content. Instead, use the in-house publishing tool.

Return to [main punctuation page](/handy-links/punctuation)

### Ellipses

**Ellipses**

We use a set of three dots (...) to indicate that words are missing from direct quotations. We do not type three periods, because these can become separated in "line breaks" on people’s computer monitors, depending how they have their browsers set. Instead, we use HTML coding to keep the cluster together (generally rendered as "&#133;" or an equivalent through a CBC-endorsed publishing tool).

Several different publishing conventions exist for ellipses. For consistency, follow the guidelines below:

[Rule A](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#ruleA)     (Avoid "...)
[Rule B](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#ruleB)     (Put spaces ... before and after)
[Rule C](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#ruleC)     (When to use four dots)


[Rule D](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#ruleD)     (..." means voice trails off)
[Rule E](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#ruleE)     (Handling long excerpts in features)
[Trudeau and sex](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses#trudeauandsex) (An illustration)

**Rule A**
In news stories, **never use ellipses at the start of quotes**. Use them at any point in the middle. **Do not use them at the very end** (except in rare cases when indicating that the speaker's voice trailed off, as outlined in Rule D).

**Rule B**
**Type spaces before and after the three dots**, except in the case of Rule C.


**Rule C**
**If an ellipsis falls at the end of a sentence in the middle of a quote, butt it against the period.... You end up with four dots,** with no space at the beginning.


**ORIGINAL WORDING**

> _"I want you to stop adding dots, and by dots I mean ellipses, to your sentences and concentrate on adding pizzazz instead. I’m wandering off on a tangent now. Oops. I’m back. There’s more to life than punctuation."_

**Correct**

> "I want you to stop adding dots ... to your sentences and concentrate on adding pizzazz instead."

**Correct**

> "There’s more to life than punctuation."

**Wrong**

> "... There’s more to life than punctuation."

**Correct (a) + (b)**

> (a) "I want you to stop adding dots ... to your sentences and concentrate on adding pizzazz instead.... There’s more to life than punctuation."

**Constructions with several ellipses can be distracting, however,** so **it’s often better to break up the quote with attribution:**

> (b) "Stop adding dots ... to your sentences and concentrate on adding pizzazz instead," he said. "There’s more to life than punctuation."

**Two-paragraph quotes**
**A two-paragraph quote that's split at an ellipsis still satisfies Rule A.** In such rare cases, the punctuation is technically in the middle of the quote.


**ORIGINAL WORDING**

> _"Why is babbling so important? The infant is like a person who has been given a complicated piece of audio equipment bristling with unlabelled knobs and switches but missing the instruction manual. In such situations people resort to what hackers call 'frobbing' — fiddling aimlessly with the controls to see what happens. The infant has been given a set of neural commands that can move the articulators every which way, with wildly varying effects on the sound. By listening to their own babbling, babies in effect write their own instruction manuals. They learn how much to move which muscle in which way to make which change in the sound. This is a prerequisite to duplicating the speech of their parents. Some computer scientists, inspired by the infant, believe that a good robot should learn an internal software model of its articulators by observing the consequences of its owns babbling and flailing."_

\\

(Comments by Canadian-born linguist Steven Pinker in 1994)

**Edited version, with paragraph split at the ellipsis**

> "The infant is like a person who has been given a complicated piece of audio equipment bristling with unlabelled knobs and switches but missing the instruction manual. In such situations people resort to what hackers call 'frobbing' — fiddling aimlessly with the controls to see what happens....
>
> "By listening to their own babbling, babies in effect write their own instruction manuals. They learn how much to move which muscle in which way to make which change in the sound. This is a prerequisite to duplicating the speech of their parents."


Four dots are used at the end of the first paragraph because **Rule C applies.**

**See [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing) for more details, including guidelines on inserting attribution instead of an ellipsis at a paragraph break,** as well as advice on picking a different spot for the split.

See also [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for the applicable rule on closing punctuation in such cases (i.e., postponing the final inverted commas until the very end).


**Rule D**
**Close a quote with an ellipsis only when the speaker's voice trails off.** These dots do not mean that words have been left out. They imply that there weren't any more words:

> "I thought I had Rule A down pat, but then again ..."


**This punctuation is rarely used in news stories, but it is a well-known convention.** Do not put three dots at the end of quotes unless the speakers actually stop talking on their own.

**Use a dash instead of an ellipsis at the end of a quote if the person is interrupted:**

> "I thought I had Rule A down pat," said the writer. "But then again – "
>
> "No one cares," snorted the editor.

**Rule E**
**E stands for _extra-long_ exception. When condensing written text** (e.g., putting part of a book or the published transcription of a speech) **in a background feature, you can place ellipses at the beginning, middle and end of sentences and paragraphs** (depending, of course, on where you made your cuts). **This is obviously an exception to Rule A. Rule E applies only to long chunks of written text. It does not apply to brief excerpts of written text inserted into news stories.**

**
Dots easy for you to say**
**Why doesn’t Rule E govern all quotes?** In other words, why is the wider use of ellipses limited to long excerpts of written text reproduced in features?

**In stories an ellipsis at the start or end is implied.** The word ellipsis comes from a Greek term that means "leave out" (_elleipein_). Most quotations fall before or after other words spoken by the same person (and often both before and after). So if we abandoned Rule A we’d have to add dots before and after most quotes. Our pages would become unnecessarily pimpled with periods.

As the Washington Post editor Bill Walsh writes in his delightful book Lapsing Into a Comma, "It's silly to indicate omission at the beginning or end of a quote, since virtually all quotes are from people who have spoken before in their lives and will do so again." This entry appears under the heading: "... And Another Thing ..."

**Trudeau and sex**

Here’s an example of a now-famous quote being lifted from a much longer statement by Pierre Trudeau. He was talking about legislation that he had just introduced in the Commons as justice minister.

**Original comments to reporters on Dec. 21, 1967:**

_"Well, it’s certainly the most extensive revision of the Criminal Code since the new Criminal Code of the early 1950s. And in terms of the subject matter it deals with, I feel that it has knocked down a lot of totems and overridden a lot of taboos. And I feel that, in that sense, it is ‘new.’ But it’s bringing the laws of the land up to contemporary society, I think. Take this thing on homosexuality. I think the view we take here is that **there’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation**, and I think that, you know, what’s done in private between adults doesn’t concern the Criminal Code. When it becomes public, this is a different matter."_

**Correct**

> "There’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation," Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau said.


**Wrong**

> "... There’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation...," Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau said.


Colombo's New Canadian Quotations (1987), by the way, claims that Trudeau never said the above. But the video and audio is on the [CBC Archives](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/1.4715835) website. In a Dec. 22, 1967, interview Trudeau rephrased it: "The state has no place in the nation's bedrooms." This is the version cited by Colombo's. In either case, Trudeau's inspiration was clearly a Globe and Mail editorial by Martin O'Malley, which was published more than a week earlier (Dec. 12, 1967).

### Hyphens

**Hyphens**

**There's no overriding logic behind using or not using hyphens.** In the last sentence, for instance, "over-riding" is not an option listed by the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. **And since English is a living language, certain preferences change** (e.g., _e-mail_ eventually became _email),_ **especially compound nouns**(e.g., _think tank_ is commonly written as _think-tank_ now, and _by-product_ as _byproduct_). Here are some general guidelines:

(a) [Adjectives and adverbs](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens/#adjectives_2 "Hyphens") (overview)
(b) [Ages](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#ages) (33-year-old man versus Darren Dashes, 33, ...)
(c) ["per cent"](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#percent) (10 per cent increase, never 10-per-cent ...)
(d) [Adjectives used predicatively](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#predicatively) (location can govern whether hyphens are needed)
(e) [Compounds](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#compounds) (online not on line, lieutenant-governor but Governor General, sit-in not sit in, Asian Canadian not Asian-Canadian, etc.)
(f) [Electoral districts](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#electoraldistricts) (Ottawa West-Nepean and Edmonton-Wetaskiwin)
(g) [Attributive nouns](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#attributivenouns) (tree planter, layoff notice, lockout clause)
(h) [Various](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#various) (ranks such as Lt.-Gen., prefixes such as anti-, years such as 1975-76, aircraft names such as CF-18, sequences such as 18th- and 19th-century as well as over- and underfed animals, etc.)

**(a) Adjectives and adverbs**
**In general, do not bother adding hyphens to modifiers if the meaning is already clear.** This is usually determined by common usage and convention.

> foreign aid bill
>
> goods and services tax
>
> gun control legislation
>
> long forgotten complaint
>
> now rare wording
>
> once powerful group 
>
> state of the union address
>
> swine flu vaccine
>
> D minor concerto

**
But do hyphenate when modifiers form a single, separate concept that is not instantly obvious without the punctuation:**

> a know-nothing meddler 
>
> all-expenses-paid trip
>
> blood-alcohol level
>
> drinking-and-driving charge
>
> hit-and-run accident
>
> non-life-threatening injuries
>
> tax-free savings account
>
> used-car dealer
>
> worst-paid workers


**When debating which of these two categories specific modifiers fall into, keep the best interests of our audience in mind. If hyphens aid people's ability to scan text in a hurry, add the punctuation** — especially if the modifier is probably not seen or said a lot in this context (e.g., "tree-planting company" versus "high school principal" or "acid rain levels").

In recent decades, **the general publishing trend has been toward fewer hyphens** (e.g., writing about a "once common practice" instead of about a "once-common practice," with the adverb "once" being treated in the same way as "most" and "less" and "very" in routine phrasing (e.g., most efficient method, less prolific writer and very detailed instructions). While certain idioms retain hyphens based on convention, be on the lookout for redundancies (e.g., the intensifier "first" in "[**first-ever**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/e/ever/ "Ever")" can often be axed).

**In certain cases, a hyphen can change the meaning** of a sentence. For example, the **most-skilled workers** (i.e., workers who are most skilled) versus the **most skilled workers** (i.e., the greatest number of skilled workers).

**TIP: Sometimes the nature of the first word makes a difference. If it can be initially read as a verb or as a noun** (e.g., "boil" instead of "overseas"), **a hyphen is generally recommended** because the sentence becomes potentially less jarring:

> boil-water advisory
>
> overseas travel advisory


Note: A compound such as "hit and run" does not generally take hyphens when used as a noun (e.g., "**a hit-and-run investigation**" versus "**another hit and run**"). Be aware, however, that various nouns are hyphenated (**remarkable know-how**). The Canadian Oxford Dictionary is a good guide for determining such distinctions.

Always remember that **hyphens are primarily added to help readers scanning text.** Since such assessments involve personal judgment, **good writers and editors will sometimes disagree on whether the punctuation is needed**. When adding hyphens, **avoid inserting too many and be certain to place them in the right place**. In the case of adjectives and adverbs, **skip "ly" words**, which are already perceived by the eye as modifiers:

> 120-seat legislature
>
> four-kilometre hike
>
> Pulitzer Prize-winning author
>
> $25-million profit **but** a profit of $25 million (see [adjectival phrases used predicatively](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#predicatively) below)
>
> $50-billion US bailout **but** a bailout of $50 billion US
>
> fast-moving car **but** quickly moving train
>
> rarely seen event
>
> tightly woven sweater
>
> well-known person **but** perfectly clear instructions

**(b) Ages**
Although some constructions containing hyphens are common _(33-year-old Darren Dashes)_, they can also be rewritten _(Darren Dashes, 33, ran away)_. **Removing hyphens and putting ages after names frequently makes the web story easier to read.**

See [numbers](/home/n/numbers) for guidelines on when to spell out ages under 10 (e.g., _four_) and when to use figures (e.g., _4_).


**(c) The term 'per cent'**
Hyphens are not needed in some well-known foreign (e.g. Latin) phrases, including "per cent":

> 10 per cent increase (**not** 10-per-cent increase) 

> Two per cent drop (**not** 2-per-cent drop **or** two-per-cent drop)


See also [numbers](/home/n/numbers) for detailed guidelines on using figures instead of words for amounts under 10.
See also [money](/home/m/money) for detailed guidelines on reporting financial amounts, currency conversions, etc.


**(d) Adjectival phrases used predicatively**
This category’s name is intimidating, but the rule is rather simple. Generally **avoid putting hyphens in words that come after the terms they're modifying:**

> a two-and-a-half-year sentence
>
> **but** sentenced to two and a half years (_no hyphens_) 
>
> a $10-million loss
>
> **but** a loss of $10 million
>
> a well-known painter
>
> **but** the painter is well known (_no hyphens_)


**(e) Compounds**

**Short compounds traditionally drift from two words** (_on line_) **to a hyphenated version** (_on-line_) **before becoming fused** (_online_).
**
Sometimes the words don't actually shift** (_thrill-seeker_) **or change only very slowly** (_teeny-bopper_ to _teenybopper_, and _counter-argument_ to _counterargument_), **depending on usage. In other cases, they jump from two words to one without ever getting a hyphen** (e.g., CP moved from "_video cassette_" to "_videocasette_" and "_pay day_" to "_payday_" in 2003, and we switched from _pay phone_ to _payphone_ in early 2020).

**Occasionally, conventions create confusing or illogical usage** (e.g., _child care_ but _daycare_). English, however, is neither consistent nor logical. For instance, we have _front yards_ (two words) but _backyards_ (fused). **It's important to know and follow current style. When in doubt, check.**

**Longer compound nouns normally take hyphens because they're easier to read as one unit** (e.g., a _physicist-turned-novelist_ or a _convict-turned-crime-fighter_).

**Hyphens also commonly set off what amount to syllabic abbreviations represented by one capital letter of the alphabet** (e.g., _H-bomb, T-shirt, U-turn, X-ray_). Although hyphens were initially common in "_e-mail_" as well, the term is now conventionally fused (_email_). The Canadian Oxford Dictionary dropped the hyphen in 2004. The Canadian Press followed suit four years later. **CBCNews.ca adopted email in late 2008. But virtually all other generic terms that use a lowercase "e" as an abbreviation for "electronic" retain the standard [e- format](/home/e#e-)** (_e-book, e-commerce, e-health, e-learning, e-waste_, etc.), **because this punctuation helps flag these constructions**, which can otherwise be jarring when scanned. **Exceptions are based on entrenched convention**, such as _esports_, which lost its hyphen in 2017. **Some proper nouns are also fused** (_eBay, eHealth Ontario, the ePub file format_), depending on the official spelling. Since these are proprietary compounds, they frequently feature a capital letter after the lowercase "e," unlike the generic terms _email_ and _esports_. (See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for related guidelines on _iPod_, _Imax_, etc., including why _email_, _e-book_ and _iPod_ all become _Email_, _E-book_ and _IPod_ at the start of sentences.) 

**Capitalization often plays a role in determining whether to add a hyphen in compounds**, especially when individual letters denote sequence, hierarchy, etc. So it's _Exhibit A and B Block_ (no hyphens; initial caps because they're treated as name equivalents), but _A-list_ ("She's on Hollywood's A-list") and _B-team_ ("They rely more on their B-team now"), etc., because the punctuation makes the meaning clearer in the absence of capitalization. Be sure to distinguish between actual compounds (Bombardier's _[C Series](/home/a/aircraft-names)_ jets), which are treated as names, and generic nouns that are merely modified (e.g., a guitar's _C string_). 

**Hyphens appear in some titles** (lieutenant-governor) **but not in others** ([Governor General, secretary general, attorney general](/home/g/generalsuffix)), **and they’re normally kept out of job titles** (_high school principal_). See [titles](/home/t/titles)

**Sometimes, the hyphen is considered the preferred "Canadian" spelling** (especially when compared to a different U.S. form). **This is the case with "_co-operation_,"** for instance, which has a hyphen that represents a diacritical mark (ö) rarely used in English typography nowadays.

**In a few cases, editors refuse to remove the hyphen because they think the combination of letters is too awkward** (e.g., _sit-in_ and _non-Indigenous_  instead of _sitin_ and _nonIndigenous_).

Be aware that **hyphens are no longer used in geographical compounds denoting dual heritage, cultural identity, etc.** (e.g., _African American, Asian Canadian, Caribbean American, Korean Canadian_ and _Mexican American_). See [geographical demonyms](/home/r/racial-terms#geographical) for details.

**Check this site's alphabetical index first to determine if CBCNews.ca prefers a hyphen in a specific compound.** If you can't find the term, look in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.


**(f) Electoral districts**

**Prefer hyphens rather than dashes in constituency names** (e.g., _Dartmouth-Cole Harbour, Mississauga-Streetsville_). **This avoids the need to pick between long and short dashes, or to distinguish between dashes and hyphens** in various compounds (e.g., _Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Westmount_ and _Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot_ versus _Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount_ and _Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot_).

**Avoid adding unnecessary punctuation** (e.g., it's _Ottawa West-Nepean_ and _Edmonton-Wetaskiwin_ but _Ottawa South_ and _Edmonton Strathcona_).

**When unsure of a riding's name or spelling, always verify with federal/provincial officials** (e.g., [Elections Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elections.ca%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fsection%3Dres%26document%3Dindex%26lang%3De&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1rkdR3IBfbcMsawIq_7x1A)). Be aware that constituency names and boundaries can change from one election to the next.


**(g) Attributive nouns**

**Nouns are often used to modify other nouns** (_tea factory, coffee shop, tree planter, layoff notice_). **If the string of nouns is short, avoid hyphens.**

**Be sure to use nouns and not verbs in these constructions as required.** In the case of a fused noun (_layoff_), for example, do not slice the modifier into a two-word form (_lay off_). The "lay" in "lay off" is actually a verb and should not be followed by a hyphen. (So it's always _layoff notice_, **not** _lay-off notice_.)


**(h) Various other lines in the sand**

-   **When adding a prefix, we often use hyphens to keep two vowels apart** (_anti-abortion_ versus _antiwar_). **But there are plenty of exceptions** (_reopen_) **so always check**. See also [_**anti-** versus **anti**_](/home/a/anti-versus-anti)


-   **When faced with a prefix that might be misunderstood, we almost always add hyphens** (_re-cover a chair versus recover from an injury_).


-   **Verbs add complexity because they sometimes take hyphens when turned into nouns.** (_Cars drive in to the local drive-in_.) **Often, however, there are no hyphens.** (_Planes line up and then take off. We stood in the lineup and almost missed the takeoff._)


-   **In a sequence of hyphenated terms separated by unhyphenated words, leave spaces until the very end:** "_18th- and 19th-century astronomers_" and "T_he clock never made a sound on the 15-, 30- and 45-minute marks_."


-   **In a sequence of fused words, it's OK to use hyphens after an orphaned prefix to avoid repeating the same root elements:** "_over- and underfed animals_." **This shorthand can make broadcast scripts more conversational and online text easier to scan** (e.g., spelling out [PFAS](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/p/#PFAS "P") as "_per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances_"), as long as the roots are the same (e.g., write "_overfed and overworked animals_" and NOT "_overfed and -worked animals_").


-   _**Use hyphens between a figure and metric symbol in adjectives** (8-mm film, 9-mm pistol, 105-mm cannon)._


-   **Use hyphens when specifying time periods unless words such as "between" or "from" appear** (_1975-76 season_, **but** _from 1975 to 1976; 1988-98 trade figures,_ **but** _between 1988 and 1998_). **Keep in mind that a hyphen is often preferred because it makes web content easier to scan** (e.g., "presented Oct. 21-23" instead of "presented _from_ Oct. 21 to 23"). **In the case of centuries, use four digits after the hyphen if the first two numbers change** (_1799-1803_ **not** _1799-03_, etc.). See also [time](/home/t/time#1950s)


-   **Use hyphens in the names of some proper nouns,** including planes (_CF-18_) See [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names)


-   **Use hyphens in some ranks** (Lt.-Gen.) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks) and [police ranks](/home/p/police-ranks)

### Italics

**Italics**

[Specific guidelines](/handy-links/punctuation/italics#specificguidelines) (two lists)
[Rules about foreign terms](/handy-links/punctuation/italics#foreignterms) (including Latin)


[Newspapers](/handy-links/punctuation/italics#newspapers) (an expanded section)

**Overview**
**Do NOT use italics in heads** (primary headlines), **decks** (secondary headlines), **subheads** (brief headings within articles) **or cutlines** (photo captions). Also, do NOT use single quotation marks as a substitute for italics in any of the above. Instead, use regular type with appropriate capitalization. (See [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for detailed direction on using single inverted commas to flag attribution in headlines, decks, etc.).

**Use italics sparingly to flag certain nouns in the main text of stories,** according to the guidelines outlined below.

**The general rule: Italicize the titles of art, literary works and broadcast programs, but do NOT italicize the names of ships, buildings, holy books, newspapers or magazines.**

This approach distinguishes between titles and names. (Broadcast programs have titles, not names. Newspapers have names, not titles.)

It's consistent with policies at many large newspapers, including the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star and the Washington Post.

**Note:** Italics are used a lot in many style manuals, including in this Language Guide, for emphasis and to avoid what otherwise would be a flurry of quotations marks and other distracting punctuation. But CBC News writers and editors should _not_ assume this means that they have carte blanche to adopt the same typography in web stories. (The two italicized words in this paragraph are examples of what to avoid in our online journalism.)


**Specific guidelines**



**_USE ITALICS_ for titles of:**

-   **artworks** (including paintings and sculptures)

-   **books** (except holy and reference, as outlined below)

-   **CDs
    **
-   **comic strips**
-   **dance works**
-   **films**
-   **musical works** (symphonies, pop songs, etc.)
-   **plays**
-   **podcasts** (akin to radio programs)
-   **poems**
-   **radio programs** (e.g., CBC Radio’s _Cross Country Checkup_ and _[Q](/home/q)_)
-   **records**
-   **short stories**
-   **TV programs** (e.g., CBC-TV's _The National_, NBC's _Today_ show, [_The Fifth Estate_](/home/f#Fifth_Estate))
-   **videos** (films, plays, and other artworks, but not YouTube videos, as outlined below)
-   **video games** and **computer games** considered artistic creations (e.g., _SimCity, Pac-Man, Guitar Hero_) rather than merely electronic versions of board games, card games or puzzles (e.g., the nouns Monopoly, Scrabble, solitaire and sudoku would be left in regular type)

If a title is italicized, the actual format (e.g., book, VHS, DVD) or platform (e.g., desktop computer, video console, smartphone) is irrelevant. Occasionally, a specific type of game or player is part of the noun and should be put in italics (e.g., _Wii Fit_). Otherwise, leave words such as DS, GameCube, Xbox, Wii in regular type.

(See also [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the) for related guidelines, as well as [**CBC**](/home/c/cbc) for details on handling various proper nouns.)


**DO NOT use italics for names of:**

-   **broadcasters** (ABC, BBC, CBC)
-   **commissions**
-   **court cases** (R. [vs.](/home/v#versus) Morgentaler, Roe v. Wade)
-   **exhibits** (at art galleries, museums, etc.)
-   **holy books** (the Bible, the Qur'an, etc.)
-   **legislation** (proposed bills, proclaimed [acts](/home/a/act), laws, regulations, etc.)
-   **magazines**
-   **newspapers**
-   **periodicals**
-   **reference books** (dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.)
-   **reports** (e.g., a study by Statistics Canada)
-   **ships** (HMCS Corner Brook)
-   **software** other than certain games defined above (e.g., Windows 7, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Photoshop, QuickTime Pro)
-   **structures** (Empire State Building)
-   **website addresses** (see [URLs](/home/u/urls))
-   **website pages, including blogs** (unless italics are called for based on guidelines above, such as a broadcast program's internet page)
-   **wire services** (CP, AP, Reuters)

**And do NOT use italics when specifying sections of larger works,** such as:

-   **chapters of books**
-   **movements of classical works**
-   **titles of printed articles**

**Instead, use quotation marks when referring to parts of printed works,** including headlines from newspapers. **Always capitalize the first letter of all principal words in these cases,** even if they did not initially appear this way. This also applies to signs at protests, etc. But **do not put the titles of reports in quotation marks**, since these are individual publications rather than excerpts.

(See [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks))


> _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ swept the 2004 Oscars.
>
> _The Dead_ is a short story from James Joyce's _Dubliners_.
>
> For years, the only thing worth reading in that paper was _Calvin and Hobbes_.
>
> _Like a Rolling Stone_ is the first track on Bob Dylan's _Highway 61 Revisited_.
>
> Statistics Canada's released its report, How to Get Rich or Die Trying, on Thursday.
>
> The study, "Italics and The Bends," appears in the New England Journal of Medicine.
>
> The quote came from a chapter of _Chasing the Chinook_ called "Hustling Crokinole."
>
> The exhibit Tom Thomson Loved Trees includes the oil painting _Birches_.
>
> They played Bach's _Sonata in A minor_, 1st movement, flawlessly.
>
> The headline "Crikey, Just Like Mikey" appeared on the Toronto Sun's front page.
>

>
> "The Talk of The Town" is a regular feature in The New Yorker.


**YouTube video titles**, from the silly ("My Dog Plays Harmonica") to the serious ("Making Our Country Safe Again") **should be treated as headlines we quote**, with capital letters at the start of all principal words and the entire title in quotation marks. Apply this style to most other videos that are given names or labels, unless these are artistic works (e.g., plays, films, documentaries) that happen to be on video. In that case, use italics as outlined above. A definition of [principal words](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#slogans) is found in the quotation marks overview. **The same applies to podcasts** (e.g., "Episode 4: The Secret Lives of Subversive Women"). **NOTE: Although the podcast name, itself, is italicized** (e.g., _The Secret Lives of Canada_), in the same way that a radio program name is italicized, **the episode title is rendered in regular type.**


**Foreign words**
Some publications, such as the New York Times, put virtually no foreign words in italics. Others, such as the Globe and Mail, go to the other extreme, still italicizing relatively common terms such as "mujahedeen." CBC News style falls somewhere in the middle, following the entries in the Canadian Oxford pretty closely. (Exceptions are listed in this Language Guide, along with some terms not covered by the dictionary.)

**In news stories, fairly common foreign words do NOT require italics:**


> ad nauseam
>
> fatwa
>
> glasnost
>
> intifada
>
> kukri
>
> mujahedeen
>
> perestroika


**This includes currencies, legal terms, musical jargon and other words that have become part of everyday English. (For French words, follow the accents listed in the Canadian Oxford.)**

Examples are:

> ad hoc
>
> allegro
>
> café, café au lait
>
> carte blanche
>
> caveat
>
> communiqué
>
> curriculum vitae
>
> entree
>
> gesundheit
>
> haiku
>
> modus operandi
>
> obbligato
>
> per cent
>
> per diem
>
> resumé \*
>
> tête-à-tête


\* In French, the word is _résumé_. But in English, only one acute accent is required to distinguish resumé (a curriculum vitae) from resume (to start again).

**Some words may have an accent and be put in italics only in certain circumstances.** For instance "[fete](/home/f#fete)" (which means "festival" as a noun and "to honour" as a verb) is a well-established English word. But the French expression _en fête_ (which means to hold or prepare for a celebration) would be in italics and include the accent. (See [**French words and accents**](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for detailed guidelines)

**If a foreign word is not widely known, it should be put in italics.** Unless the context makes the word obvious, an explanation is required. The definition can be put in quotation marks:


> The sliding door, called a _shoji_, had no handle.
>
> _Allahu akbar_ is Arabic for "God is greater," she said, not for "God is great." At its core, the commonly mistranslated expression is a statement of humility by Muslims.


**The Canadian Oxford dictionary is a good guide.**

For instance:


**NO italics**

ad nauseam
caveat
carte blanche
communiqué
coup
glasnost

kukri
mujahedeen
rigor mortis  



**ITALICS**

_au revoir
carpe diem
caveat emptor
coup de grâce
coup d'état
de rigueur
objet d'art
persona non grata
realpolitik
schadenfreude
shoji_

**Be sure to check spellings of transliterations.** Try the Language Guide first. If the word is not there, consult the Canadian Oxford.

(See also [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) and [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words))

**Use italics for obscure foreign terms or phrases, or to highlight words that require translation:**


> Economists refer to it as a _ceteris paribus_ assumption.
>
> Canada's motto, _a mari usque ad mare_, means "from sea to sea."
>
> "There’s one word for it," she said: "_Schadenfreude_."
>
> The term _caveat emptor_ may sound exotic, but it's simply Latin for "buyer beware."
>
> The word "italic" comes from the Greek term _italikos_, which means "Italian."
>
> "No mandate? What about a _mandat de perquisition_ \[search warrant\]," he shouted.


**Religious terms, such as jihad and hajj, do NOT need to be italicized:
**

> After the bodies of the crushed pilgrims were removed the hajj resumed.
>
> The scarf, or hijab, she wore covered most of her face.
>
> He carried a ceremonial knife known as a kukri.


**And italics are NOT required for the names of organizations that are already marked by capitalization close to English (i.e, with most words featuring an initial capital letter):**


> He's accused of having ties to al-Qaeda.
>
> She joined Cirque du Soleil in 2002.
>
> Most of the province's teachers belong to the _Centrale des enseignants du Québec_.


**Scientific names**
Generally avoid Latin terms (e.g., _Aix galericulata_ instead of mandarin duck) except in some science stories or news features that benefit from such terms.

**When scientific names are used for species of animals, plants, etc. italicize all Latin but capitalize only the first word** (the genus):


> _Branta canadensis_ for Canada goose
>
> _Castor fiber canadensis_ for Canadian beaver
>
> _Homo sapiens_ for humans
>
> _Orcinus orca_ for killer whale


**Italicize such scientific jargon only if the genus is capitalized and the full Latin term is spelled out** (e.g., _Bacillus thuringiensis_). But when the genus is abbreviated, such as in the second reference to certain bacteria, do not italicize (e.g., E. coli stands for _Escherichia coli_).

**Do NOT italicize common names of diseases, bacteria, parasitic micro-organisms, etc.** (e.g, coliform and rickettsia). **Do NOT capitalize the generic names of bacteria**, such as bacillus or streptococcus, **or the proper scientific names of diseases such as BSE** (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

(See Latin [scientific names](/home/l/latin-scientific-names) for more details)


**Emphasizing words**
**In news stories, we do NOT use italics to place emphasis on a word or phrase.** Quotation marks can sometimes be used for this purpose:

"The door was 'unlocked,'" she testified, raising her voice slightly as she said "un."

But there can be problems with this type of punctuation, including unintended sarcasm:

"His 'poetry' is not widely read," she said.

Is the speaker above emphasizing one form of writing or questioning the merits of calling it poetry? Avoid using inverted commas if the meaning can be misinterpreted. (More detailed guidelines on [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) can be found in the main punctuation section of the Language Guide.)

**Italics can be used in columns, features, and so forth to convey emphasis or to set a word apart for clarity:**


> They didn't merely like the orchestra's performance. They _loved_ it.


**But we do _not_ use italics this way in news stories.** (The word "not" in the previous sentence is one more example of what to avoid.)


**A final word about newspaper names**
**Capital letters are sufficient to identify newspapers, according to widely followed convention.** (This is the approach taken by the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, New York Times and numerous other media outlets.) **Italics are unnecessary**.

> the Chicago Sun-Times
>
> the Halifax Chronicle Herald
>
> the Jerusalem Post
>
> the St. John's Telegram
>
> the Vancouver Sun
>
> the Winnipeg Free Press


**In second reference, the names of newspapers can be shortened as long as there's no confusion with a publication from another city** (e.g., the Post and the Free Press but the Vancouver Sun not the Sun in a story that also mentions the Toronto Sun).

In rare instances when the name of a publication may not be readily identified in a sentence (e.g., the Australian), add context to help the reader:


> Indonesia is bracing for another bomb attack, according to the Sydney-based paper the Australian.


**By not putting publications' names in italics, we can avoid the hassle of worrying about whether a specific city is part of the proper noun.** (CP uses similar reasoning with its blanket rule to use a lowercase "the" before all newspaper names, instead of checking to see if it's The Hamilton Spectator but the Toronto Star.)

For instance, the Gazette in Montreal does not include the city in its name. So if we used italics we'd have to write the Montreal _Gazette_ but the _Toronto Star_. Another example is the Times of London, which does not include "London" in its name.

In his book _Lapsing into a Comma_, Bill Wash of the Washington Post says media outlets have four options in a case like this:

1\. _The Times_ of London (if you use italics and a capital "T" in "The")
2\. The (London) Times (if you don't use italics but insist on a capital "T" in "The")
3\. the London _Times_ (if you use italics but a small "t" in "the")
4\. the London Times (if you don’t use italics and prefer a small "t" in "the")
**
CBCNews.ca style is No. 4, the London Times** (which can also be written as the Times of London).

### Periods

**Periods**

**Put periods at the end of declarative sentences:**

> The violinist smiled.


**Put periods inside quotation marks:**

> The violinist smiled and said, "I should have worn a bow tie."


**Put periods inside brackets only when the punctuation applies to the material inside the brackets:**

> They complained to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
>
> The prime minister is expected to deliver his address at 8 p.m. ET. (CBC will broadcast the speech live on radio, TV and the internet.)


If the declarative sentence ends with an abbreviation featuring a period, a "second" full stop is required only if (i) the abbreviation falls directly before a bracket, and (ii) the abbreviation's period does not function as the entire sentence's closing punctuation (i.e., it lies within a parenthetical section):

> The violinist smiled as the plane landed in the U.S. 
>
> (The violinist was born in the U.K.) 
>
> The violinist had 10 honorary doctorates and one earned degree (a B.Mus.).


See also [brackets](/handy-links/punctuation/brackets)

**Use periods in most all-lowercase abbreviations** (_a.k.a., e.g., etc., ft., lb., m.p.h., vol., yd._). See [lowercase abbreviation](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/abbreviations/#lowercase "Abbreviations")s for details and exceptions.

**Use periods in abbreviations that blend capital and small letters only if the abbreviation ends in small letters** (_B.Ed._ **but** _PhD_). See [university degrees](/home/d/degrees)


**Use periods in geographical abbreviations** (_U.S., U.K._) **including the [geographical components of most proper nouns](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents)** (_B.C. Hydro, N.B. Power_), except in rare cases of truly unorthodox spellings (e.g., fused names like _SaskPower_ and _WorkplaceNL_).

**Leave out periods in most other all-capitalized abbreviations** (_AIDS, UN, RCMP, MP, BA_). See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for more details.

**One common exception involves shortening proper names to a letter or two**, such as:


> _The mysterious witness was referred to as Mr. B._
>
> _Toronto is sometimes called T.O._


**But leave out this punctuation when the letters themselves function as the names of people or things**, such as:


> _Exhibit A was introduced, and people in the courtroom started crying._
>
> _The identity of Lady X was never revealed._


See [abbreviations of single letters](/home/a/abbreviations#singleletters) for more detailed guidelines and examples.


**Do not use periods in currency abbreviations** ($500 US, $750 Cdn). See [numbers](/home/n/numbers)

**Use periods in a.m. and p.m.** (lowercase) **but not in time zone abbreviations** (ET, MT, etc.). See [time](/home/t/time)

**First and middle initials** are usually straightforward:


> C.S. Lewis
>
> J.K. Rowling
>
> John F. Kennedy
>
> J.R.R. Tolkien
>
> Michael J. Fox
>
> Samuel L. Jackson


This includes **initials used without any accompanying spelled-out names:**


> Who shot J.R.?
>
> Did E.T. really call home?


In these cases, J.R. stands for J.R. Ewing, and E.T. is treated as a name rather than merely as an abbreviation for extraterrestrial.

Be aware, however, that **in rare cases abbreviated names that normally include periods lose their punctuation based on convention:**


> _"I first met JFK in 1956," she said. "He told me to call him Jack not John."_
>
> _FDR's speech inspired him to go into politics._



**Headlines and promotional blurbs**
**Do not put periods at the end of headlines, subheads, links or brief blurbs identifying audio or video content on CBCNews.ca.** These are not treated as complete sentences:

> Same-sex marriage leaves House divided 
>
>   (_Headline_)
>
> Detectives puzzled by letter
>
>   (_Subheadline_)
>
> From Sept. 17, 2003: Same-sex marriage leaves House divided 
>
>   (_Link to archived story_)
>
> James Minifie reports for CBC Radio (Runs 1:47)
>
> Michael Maclear reports for CBC-TV (Runs 2:15)
>
> SARS: Latest timeline, background, photo galleries 
>
>   (_A typical promotion on the news page_)


**Sometimes, closing punctuation appears inside a long headline, subhead, etc.**, that contains more than one digested sentence. **Even in these cases, however, avoid adding periods to the end:
**



> 3 asteroids will fly past Earth on Saturday. Here is why there is no need to panic
>
>
> Look up, way up! It's International Observe the Moon Night Saturday
>
>
> Want to soak up the savings from solar? Here's what you should know
>
>
> Re-centralizing? Re-disorganizing? What exactly is Ontario doing to its health-care system?


**When longer (complete) sentences are used in links to material, periods should be included:**

> Stanley Burke talks to Norman DePoe about Washington’s recent ban on beef exports. (Runs 3:15)
>
> The federal government introduced sweeping changes to Canada’s punctuation laws in 1965. Larry Zolf reflects on the controversy in his column, Question period and question marks.


**Put periods at the end of pull quotes**, which are treated as complete sentences:


      "Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast."                                                     —Oscar Wilde


**Bulleted lists**
**Put periods at the end of each entry in a bulleted list, no matter how brief.**

The report recommends:

-   Increasing inspections of water purification plants.


-   Decreasing the GST from 7 to 6 per cent.


-   Tripling the salaries of rodeo clowns.

### Possessive apostrophe

**Possessive apostrophes**

Adding a possessive apostrophe is **often straightforward. But there are times when writers need to pause** to decide (i) if one is even necessary, and (ii) if so, where it goes.

[False possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#falsepossessives) (a _Leafs player_ vs. a _Leafs' win_)
[Fewer 'description' exceptions](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#fewerexceptions) (_leaders' debate, premiers' conference, teachers' strike_)
[Check proper nouns](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#propernouns) (_Workers' versus Workers Compensation Board_)
[Compound nouns](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#compoundnouns) (_stone's throw_ and _arm's-length_)
[Time](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#time) (_three weeks' pay_ but _four months pregnant_)
[Pronouns](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#pronouns) (_its_ and _whose_ not _it's_ and _who's_)
[s' versus s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s) (Charles's not Charles')

**General guidelines**


**Rule A**

If the subject is singular (**a doctor**), then the apostrophe goes before the "s" (**a doctor's office**). This applies to terms like "each other" (**each other's tuques**).


**Rule B**

If the subject is plural (**doctors**), then the apostrophe usually goes after the "s" (**both doctors' patients**).

The **big exception to Rule B** is when **the noun itself is plural**. There are two types:


> (1) Words that are always plural (e.g., **children**, as in "the children's favourite books"); and
>
> (2) Words that are both singular and plural (e.g., **aircraft**).


The latter category (**Rule B, Exception 2**) **can cause headaches**. It's wrong to write "the three aircrafts," for instance. The correct form would be "the three aircraft." So, as with children's, the only possible plural would be "_the three aircraft's engines_," which looks rather absurd.

What do you do in these cases? **Never add an "s" to a plural noun that doesn't take one simply because you're looking for a swell place to park an apostrophe** ("the three aircrafts' engines" is wrong).

The consensus among veteran editors is to **recast these troublesome sentences**. In other words, it's perfectly acceptable to write "the aircraft's engines" when you mean one aircraft. But for plural constructions pick another noun that's singular and then add an "s" ("the three planes' engines").

Some other nouns that are considered both singular and plural are: _bison, deer, fish, insignia, moose, species, swine, trout_ and _wheat_.


**Rule C**

The "C" here could stand for controversial. **Don't add apostrophes that aren't needed.** It's sound advice. **But deciding when an apostrophe is required involves judgment, and not everyone agrees on how to handle each case.
**

**False possessives**
Some people who've mastered Rule A and Rule B are very quick to ignore Rule C. They slap apostrophes on the ends of a lot words that don't actually need them. This is particularly unfortunate when writers start changing the formal names of organizations because they wrongly assume that someone has left out punctuation.

**We distinguish between true possessives** (last night's Winnipeg Jets' win) **and indisputably false possessives** (the Winnipeg Jets left-winger). The **latter often feature attributive nouns** (Jets, Jays) functioning as descriptive detail. In these cases, punctuation is unnecessary. For example:


> **ATTRIBUTIVE NOUNS** (leave out apostrophes)

> > the **Leafs** player
>
> > the **Blue Jays** pitcher
>
> > another **Beatles** song
>
> > a Charles **Dickens** novel

> **TRUE POSSESSIVES** (include apostrophes)

> > the **Leafs'** first-round draft pick
>
> > the **Blue Jays'** victory
>
> > the **Beatles'** second Grammy
>
> > Charles **Dickens's** tenth child


The **main exceptions are proper nouns**, such as the formal names of organizations (the Veterans Affairs Department, a Diners Club card), **which may or may not include possessive apostrophes**, depending on stated preferences. (See [check proper nouns](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#propernouns) below.)


**Fewer 'description' exceptions**
**We steer clear of punctuation in expressions that are unambiguously descriptive rather than possessive**, along the lines of "a toilet seat" and "a library book" (rather than "a toilet's seat" or a "library's book"). For example:


> an **awards** ceremony
>
> a **board of directors** meeting (i.e., a board meeting not a board's meeting)
>
> the **complaints** department
>
> a **1950s** band


But **we usually include possessive apostrophes in constructions that are debatably designated as "descriptive" by CP, AP and some other news organizations.** For consistency, **this means many common, generic expressions take punctuation**, such as:


> **carpenters'** union
>
> **children's** playground
>
> **citizens'** band radio
>
> **farmers'** market
>
> **first ministers'** meeting
>
> **gentlemen's** club
>
> **leaders'** debate
>
> **men's** prison
>
> **pilots'** spokesperson
>
> **premiers'** conference
>
> **seniors'** residence
>
> **teachers'** strike
>
> **women's** soccer team


See [style shift](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#styleshift) below for background on why we think this approach is preferable.

**Be aware that certain compounds take singular, rather than plural, possessives often because of convention.** The Canadian Oxford Dictionary is a good guide. Examples are:


> **athlete's** foot
>
> **citizen's** arrest
>
> **doctor's** office
>
> **driver's** licence
>
> **farmer's** sausage
>
> **hitchhiker's** guide
>
> **hornet's** nest



**Style shift**
**CBC News expanded use of possessive apostrophes** in December 2020 **to lessen confusion and increase consistency.** We decided a simpler style made more sense, **given the fuzzy differences between certain descriptive and possessive constructions.** More than once, we found ourselves twisted into awkward positions, tortuously arguing that, say, "leaders' debate" and "seniors' home" were fine based on convention but that "premiers' conference" and "teachers' strike" were somehow less desirable, if not actually wrong, based on highly subjective assessments.

**Usage guides are divided over the best path to take.** "More conservative authorities recommend retaining the apostrophe," according to the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage. **We think including the punctuation in questionably descriptive cases makes decisions simpler and typography more uniform.** It seems unnecessarily confusing to insist that CP is right to prefer, say, "citizens band radio" and "farmers market" when our primary dictionary, the Canadian Oxford, lists more orthodox renderings (i.e., "citizens' band radio" and "farmers' market"). The same is true of teachers' college and athletes' village (both in Oxford), underscoring the sometimes arbitrary nature of judging what is genuinely possessive.


**HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE:** English punctuation conventions evolve. For example, virtually no one added singular possessive apostrophes until the end of the 17th century (e.g., boy's, girl's), according to the 2015 Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Plural possessives didn't appear until roughly 100 years later (e.g., boys', girls'). Fowler's says the "relinquishment of the apostrophe" discussed above began around 1900, as various companies, organizations and publishers decided to start treating certain words as attributive nouns rather than as true possessives. It cites this example: "Barclays Bank is attributive, implying association with Barclays, whereas Barclays' Bank is possessive, implying ownership by people called Barclay. Some other names appear in various forms, with and without apostrophes (e.g., Sainsburys/Sainsbury's). This trend towards the dropping of the apostrophe in such names and titles seems certain to continue."



**Check proper nouns**
**Never change a proper noun** (e.g., the name of an organization) **simply because you assume an apostrophe should be added or removed.** If one group calls itself the "Big Valley Students' Federation" while another prefers the "Mountain Top Musicians Association" then we follow their choices.


**Workers' versus Workers (Compensation Board)**
To show why checking names is important, **here is an example of different approaches taken to "workers' compensation" across the country** in 2019:


> **Workers Compensation Board** (_no apostrophe_ in P.E.I., Manitoba)
>
> **Workers' Compensation Board** (_with apostrophe_ in Alberta, Saskatchewan, N.S., N.W.T. and Nunavut)
>
> **Workers' Compensation, Health and Safety Board** (Yukon)
>
> **WorkplaceNL**, formerly the Workers' Compensation Board (Newfoundland and Labrador)
>
> **WorkSafeBC**, formerly the Workers' Compensation Board (British Columbia)
>
> **WorkSafeNB**, formerly Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission (New Brunswick)
>
> **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board** (Ontario)


When a proper noun is commonly used, it's usually unnecessary to specify that a different, officially registered is still on the books. In British Columbia, for example, the **Workmen's Compensation Board** was officially renamed the **Workers' Compensation Board** in 1974 — a change officially reflected in our journalism. Then in 2004, the agency began operating as **WorkSafeBC**. Although, technically, the legal name was the same (i.e., the Workers' Compensation Board), there was no need to point this out once WorkSafeBC became entrenched. Instead, it was usually sufficient to report the updated operating name: WorkSafeBC. This is no different from countless "legal names" of government bodies that have different "applied names" (e.g., the federal Department of Industry was rebranded as "Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada" in 2015, even though its legal name remained the Department of Industry).

**Alzheimer's disease versus Down syndrome**
Just because a medical condition is named after someone does not automatically mean that a possessive apostrophe is added. It depends largely on convention (e.g., **[Alzheimer's disease](/home/a#alzheimer)** but **[Down syndrome](/home/d#downsyndrome)**). Although there's been a trend in some quarters to start dropping apostrophes from various eponymous nouns, the punctuation remains common in many cases (**[Huntington's](/home/h#Huntington)**, **Parkinson’s, [Lou Gehrig's disease](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/#ALS "A")**) in respected medical journals and mainstream media. **Even when a term is treated as a possessive** (Alzheimer's), **a proper noun might be spelled differently** (the Alzheimer Society of Canada, and the Huntington Society of Canada). Always verify an organization's official name.


**Compound nouns**
**Some idiomatic compounds have apostrophes, even though many do not involve possession** (_a week's pay, two cents' worth_). **These have become entrenched over time.** They are generally treated as singular. **Most are listed in the dictionary.** Some are also used in official names:


> _arm's-length, baker's dozen, cow's milk, debtor's prison, Father's Day, fool's paradise, hair's breadth, Mother's Day, Reader's Digest, stone's throw, traveller's cheques, writer's block, writer's cramp,_ etc.

**Time**
**In the case of time or money, there's a fairly simple way to find out if an apostrophe is needed.** Make the construction singular. If the revised form takes an apostrophe, then one is required in the original:


> **three weeks' pay** (_because one week's pay takes an apostrophe_)
>
> **four years' worth of work** (_because one year's work takes an apostrophe_)
>
> **five months pregnant**, not months' (_because one month's pregnant makes no sense_)

**Pronouns**
Rule C (don't add apostrophes that aren't needed) also applies to most common pronouns, including **hers, theirs, ours, and yours**.

In this group, **"its" and "whose" seem to cause the most trouble**. Some people confuse these pronouns with similar looking and sounding contractions: its for it's (which stands for "it is") and whose for who's (which stands for "who is").

**Contractions need an apostrophe to represent what's missing. But most possessive pronouns need nothing more than a measure of care:**

> "The party says **it's** time **its** members vote on the proposal."
>
> "**Who's** going to decide **whose** opinion matters most?"


One should always be on the lookout for exceptions. Indefinite pronouns do require apostrophes: try one's best, anyone's guess, somebody else's problem.

### question marks

**Question marks**

**In most cases, questions marks are straightforward. They generally go at the end of interrogatives.**


> Do you agree?
> What's wrong with this picture? Identify five anachronisms in this movie clip.
> "Does the ? sign have a fancy name?" he asked. "Yes," she explained. "It's called an eroteme in some circles."


**In rare cases, a series of question marks can appear within the same sentence** to represent more than one query:


> Homicide detectives must ask themselves, Are there obvious clues? obvious motives? obvious suspects?


**Questions marks are not necessary at the end of indirect questions:**


> The doctor asked whether she smoked.
> He asked who called for the vote.


**In the case of certain questions that are not intended to solicit actual answers, closing punctuation can vary** depending on the writer's preference:


> "Why don't we go." (No question mark to emphasize it's a suggestion rather than a question.)
> "Why didn't we go?" (Question mark underscores a decision-making review.)
> "Would you mind spelling his last name." (No question mark to emphasize it's a request for action rather than a true interrogative.)


**It's never wrong to add a question mark to a rhetorical question, but the punctuation is also frequently dropped by convention.** Keep in mind, however, that some iconic rhetorical questions do feature questions marks. For example, in the 1960s classic song _Blowin' in the Wind_, Bob Dylan asks:


> "How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man?"


There's no right answer, like four roads or 116 roads. It's a rhetorical question, and, so, a period would suffice. But since the lyric is frequently transcribed with a question mark, including on the artist's official website, bobdylan.com, it's OK to match that style in our journalism.

In direct quotes, **question marks can appear inside or outside of inverted commas, depending on the sentence's meaning:**


> "When?"
> "Who asked 'When?'"
> In the words of George Carlin, "Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do 'practice'?"


See also [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for related guidelines and examples.

**Question marks take the place of commas or periods in routine attribution:**


> "Do you have anything to declare?" the border guard repeated, raising his voice slightly.


**Question marks are flush to periods at the end of abbreviations:**


> "Do you mean 9 a.m. or 9 p.m.?"
>
> "Does the book mention John F. Kennedy Jr.?"

### Quotation marks

**Quotation marks**


[Closing punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#closing) (.")



[Highlighting](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#highlighting) (emphasizing a word, irony)
[Quoting slogans, headlines, YouTube videos, podcasts](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#slogans) (capitalizing '[principal words](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks/#principalwords "Quotation marks")')
[Bridging gaps](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#bridginggaps) (quotes carried over two paragraphs)
[Nicknames](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#nicknames) (use brackets, not " ")
[Other guidelines](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#otherguidelines) (e.g., strict rules on "cleaning up" quotes)

**"Double" versus 'single'**
**Use double (" ") quotation marks for quotes in the main bodies of stories, and single (' ') quotation marks for quotes within quotes:**

> "They gave it 110 per cent," said the coach. "It was a great game."
>
> "You claim 'they gave it 110 per cent,' but that's not actually possible," pointed out a pedant.
>
> "Well," snapped the coach, "as my shortstop likes to say, 'You've never seen us do math.'"

**
Use double quotation marks in summaries** (brief news capsules of usually no more than about two dozen words that appear on various platforms, including partners' websites).

**Use single quotation marks in headlines** for verbatim attribution:

> 'Not a red cent to Hamas,' MacKay says
>
> Bush praises Harper's 'steely resolve' on softwood
>
> Apple blasts 'state-sponsored piracy' in France


**Use single quotation marks in decks** (secondary headlines), **subheads, pull quotes and photo captions** for verbatim attribution. (See [periods](/handy-links/punctuation/periods) for guidelines on punctuation at the end of headlines, pull quotes, etc.)

Do **NOT** use single quotation marks as a substitute for [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#sansitalics).

**When using quotation marks, do NOT alter direct transcriptions** (i.e., by dropping, adding or changing words), **even to shorten headlines, without flagging the revisions with proper punctuation** (e.g., ellipses or square brackets). See [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing) for detailed guidelines.

CBC.ca once had a news writer who assumed that single quotation marks (' ') indicated a paraphrase. They do not. **When you write a summary of someone else's words, you need attribution not special punctuation.**

In Britain, by the way, most writers and editors prefer 'single' inverted commas for the main quote, and "double" inverted commas for quotes within quotes. They also put most punctuation outside quotation marks (".) (",).

For more background, see the Quick Queries feature of CBC.ca's Words: Woe & Wonder site, [single versus double](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fquick%2Fcomments%2Fsingledouble.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0hMoBGhMIgvzZiJPMUXcc4) and [inside versus outside](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fquick%2Fqueries%2Finsideoutside.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0IJ52nOHQa_ftO9L-Ytqzi).


**Colons, commas and capitals**
**Use a colon to introduce quotes that are longer than one short sentence or that you want to emphasize. Otherwise use commas. Capitalize the first word of a quote only if it represents the start of a new sentence:**

> When asked exactly what kind of proof Canada wants before backing a military strike against Iraq, the prime minister put it this way: "A proof is a proof. What kind of a proof? It's a proof. A proof is a proof. And when you have a good proof, it's because it's proven."
>
> The accused dropped his head as the verdict was read: "Guilty."
>
> The pilot said, "Return to your seats."


(The comma in the last example above is used to separate an introductory statement from a quote. Compare with "Run for your lives!" below.)

> As the shots were fired, students began shouting "Run for your lives!"


(There is no comma before "Run" because the quote is an integral part of the clause about students shouting. Punctuation would hurt the sentence's flow.)

> "It is," he chuckled, "very possible."
>
> "It is sad," she whispered. "They have no money and no hope."

**Most closing punctuation goes inside (.") not (".)**
**Put most closing punctuation on the inside of quotation marks** (including quotes within quotes) **unless there's a question mark or exclamation mark that applies to the entire sentence:**


> The kids had never heard the word "copacetic."
>
> "Most people say 'gild the lily' instead of 'paint the lily,'" he grumbled.
>
> All three shouted, "That's ridiculous!"
>
> Tucker turned and asked, "Where were you born?"
>
> Is Canada really made up of "two solitudes"?


(The question mark is outside the closing quotes in the last example above because it applies to the entire sentence. See also [questions marks](/handy-links/punctuation/question-marks) for related guidelines.)

**When flush to closing quotation marks, colons and semicolons always go outside** (i.e., ": and "; rather than :" and ;"), as in:


> She said another example of common redundancy is "safe haven": "I'm still waiting for someone to name a 'haven' that isn't safe."
>
> The young campers mustered up enough courage to grab the "ghost"; it was a pillow case, a fishing pole and a flashlight.


In summary: **Put periods and commas INSIDE closing quotation marks, put colons and semicolons OUTSIDE closing quotation marks, and put most question marks and exclamation marks INSIDE closing quotation marks.** The exception is when the latter (question marks and exclamation marks) apply to the entire sentence rather than merely to the quoted text.


**"Fragments" are sometimes fine**
**If a speaker or writer has used a few words that are noteworthy** (e.g., they're unusual or controversial), **you can put quotation marks around them in a story.** These brief quotes jazz up leads, capture tone, underscore attribution, etc.


**Correct:**

> The kidnappers made some "stupid slips," the detective said.


**Unnecessary:**

> Police are certain the girl is "nearby."


**Guard against using too many brief quotes. Sentences begin to look odd if they're blanketed with them.** And some readers start wondering about all the words we've left out.


**'Fragments' in headline attribution**
**Brief quotes are OK in headlines with attribution, but the words should be noteworthy. Always use single, not double, quotation marks:**


**Correct:**

> What's a 'boondoggle'? asks PM
>
> 'Free my baby,' pleads mother of kidnapped girl
>
> 'I am above politics': Clarkson


**Unnecessary:**

> Tape proves missing girl 'still alive': mother


**Quotation marks do NOT replace italics in headlines**
**Although we avoid [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) in heads** (main headlines), **decks** (secondary headlines), **subheads and photo captions, we do NOT use quotation marks as a substitute.**

**Instead, we use regular type and proper capitalization** for the titles of books, films, broadcast programs, etc., in these cases (e.g., _As It Happens_ in the body of a story but As It Happens in a headline):

> As It Happens picks new host
>
> Skybreaker, Caramba win children's book awards
>
> Da Vinci Code success sparks Angels & Demons plans


**Reserve single quotation marks for verbatim attribution** in headlines, decks, subheads and photo captions. (For details, see [" " versus ' '](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#doubleversussingle) above).

**Highlighting with punctuation**
**Use quotation marks, **not** italics, to emphasize a specific word or phrase in news stories or to indicate irony:**

> Jam-filled doughnuts are called "bismarcks" in some parts of Canada.
>
> She said the "friendly" match ended in a bloody brawl.


See also [so-called
](/home/s/so-called)
**Use italics, **not** quotation marks, for certain foreign terms, such as _caveat emptor_.
**
See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics)

**Quotation marks are unnecessary around most proper nouns with capital letters,** such as the names of newspapers and nicknames:

> The papers for sale include the Jerusalem Post and the Chicago Sun-Times.
>
> Williams, also known as the Splendid Splinter, still holds the record.


See also [brackets](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#nicknames) for nicknames (below)


**Quoting headlines, slogans, chapters, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc.**
**When quoting the titles of various parts of larger, published works put all the principal words in capital letters,** even if they weren't printed this way. **This includes newspaper headlines, articles from magazines, and chapters of books:**

> Irwin's stunt conjured up memories of Michael Jackson dangling his baby from a balcony, and prompted one paper to splash "Crikey, Just Like Mikey" across its front page.


The titles of books, poems, short stories, broadcast programs, etc., should be put in italics. But the names of magazines, newspapers, etc., do not require italics. (See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics))

**Slogans should also normally be in quotation marks with all principal words capitalized**, even if the original sign, legislation or other printed material uses a different style:

> One protester carried a placard that read "Smart Bombs but Dumb President." 
>
> Products other than steel and iron could be swept into the "America First" clause of the U.S. stimulus bill, Canada's international trade minister warned.


**YouTube video titles**, from the silly ("My Dog Plays Harmonica") to the serious ("Making Our Country Safe Again") **should be treated as headlines we've quoted**, with capital letters starting all principal words and the entire title in quotation marks. Apply this style to most other videos that are given names or labels, unless these are artistic works (e.g., plays, films, documentaries) that happen to be on video. In that case, use [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics). **The same applies to podcasts** (e.g., "Episode 4: The Secret Lives of Subversive Women").



**Principal words ('With' and 'Is' but usually not 'for' or 'in' or 'a')**
When deciding which words to capitalize **in headings, titles, etc.**, the **standard practice** is to **limit capital letters to the first word as well as all principal words**. Determining what qualifies involves more than merely counting the number of characters. **Principal words are commonly defined as nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs,** **as well as all other words having four or more letters.** We follow this approach for consistency. For example, _with, over, under, more, less, above,_ etc., take initial capital letters in quoted titles, slogans, etc., while _of, in, an, a, the, but, for,_ etc., do not unless they're at the start of the entire string. The principal word  convention explains why _The World **at** Six_ and _The Nature **of** Thing_s keep the prepositions "at" and "of" lowercase, while programs such as _As **It** Happens_ and _This **Is My** Music_ have initial caps across the board (i.e., "It" is a pronoun and "Is" is a "to be" verb, and "My" is a possessive adjective). When in doubt, verify the typographical preference of a given broadcast program. The same convention explains why _**To Kill a Mockingbird**_ and _**How to Get Rich**_ and _**Got to Get You Into My Life**_ feature some brief elements (three characters or fewer) that are capitalized. Non-principal words are capitalized only if they appear at the start of titles (e.g., _**A Star Is Born**_ and _**The Lord of the Rings**_).


**Bridging gaps**
**When a continuous quote by one person extends into a second paragraph, put the quotation marks at the beginning of each but at the end of only the last one:**

> "**S**omerset Maugham wished to be famous and rich, and for at least 60 of his 91 years he had his desire," Robertson Davies said in 1982. "Few authors before him can have had a wider audience or a larger fortune. Few can have been sought out by so many celebrated peopl**e.**
>
>  "**F**ew can have been so much envied, so patronized and belittled by literary critics, so imitated by other writers. Fame and wealth followed him all the days of his life**."**


**If the words in the first paragraph represent only a partial quote, however, use inverted commas at the beginning and end of each paragraph:**

> He said Somerset Maugham wanted to be "famous and rich**.**"
>
>  **"F**ew authors before him can have had a wider audience or a larger fortune. Few can have been sought out by so many celebrated people. Few can have been so much envied, so patronized and belittled by literary critics, so imitated by other writers. Fame and wealth followed him all the days of his life**."**


(See [ellipses](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses) for rare cases of an edit that falls in the same spot as the paragraph split.)


**Use brackets for nicknames**
**When inserting nicknames into proper nouns, use parentheses (not quotation marks):**

> John Birks (Dizzy) Gillespie
>
> Joseph (Joey) Smallwood


Note: If nicknames are well-known, they can also be used in first reference (e.g., _Dizzy Gillespie_ and _Joey Smallwood_). See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames) and [round versus square](/handy-links/punctuation/brackets) brackets.

### s' versus s's

**s' versus s's**

[Is it plural?](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s#GM) (Times's versus General Motors')
[Embedded apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s#embedded) (McDonald's and the Oakland A's)


**Overview**
As outlined in the main section on [possessive constructions](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe), deciding where to put the apostrophe is usually pretty obvious:

**singular**
a _child's_ pencil, a _mechanic's_ wrench, an _MP's_ conscience

**plural**
the _children's_ desks, the _mechanics'_ tools, the _MPs'_ expense accounts

But when a word ends with the letter "s," even some experienced writers find their confidence slipping. Here's the convention that's been widely accepted for years (tackled as Rule 1 in the classic usage guide by Strunk and White, _The Elements of Style_):

**Singular nouns that end in "s" generally take an apostrophe and then another "s" to convey ownership.** So it's:

> A witness's testimony
>
> The bus's engine
>
> A business's profit
>
> Telus's market share
>
> Your boss's permission
>
> The fortress's gate
>
> A dress's colour
>
> The walrus's tusks
>
> Paris's nightlife
>
> Dallas's debt
>
> Mars's orbit
>
> Pope Francis's health
>
> Mike Harris's kitchen
>
> Premier Ernie Eves's cabinet
>
> Bill Holmes's kitchen cabinet
>
> Oscar Pistorius's medals
>
> Russell Williams's victims
>
> Charles's horse
>
> Burns's poems
>
> Strauss's music
>
> The space shuttle Atlantis's last launch
>
> St. James's Palace

> CBC News's response
>
>     (See [unnecessary possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s#unnecessary) — _e.g., prefer "the CBC News bureau" over "CBC News's bureau"_)

> The press's coverage
>
>     (Prefer "media's coverage," _not because we have anything against the letter "s" but because the CBC doesn't use presses._)



**A few exceptions**
There are **three main departures from the above guidelines:**

**(1) Some figures from ancient times,** which have entrenched punctuation. So it's generally:

> Euripides' plays (**not** Euripides's)
>
> Herodotus' story (**not** Herodotus's)
>
> Socrates' trial (**not** Socrates's)


**(2) Some modern proper nouns** with entrenched punctuation:

    Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood (**not** Rogers's, and **not** Neighbourhood with a "u")

**(3) Nouns that end with a definite "iz" sound.** Adding the extra "s" is considered overkill in this case. (You wind up with what amounts to "iz-iz.")

> Moses' laws (**not** Moses's) 
>
>     It's easier to write: the laws of Moses
>
> Jesus' followers (**not** Jesus's) 
>
>     It's easier to write: the followers of Jesus


What falls into this third category is sometimes debatable. But it's worth distinguishing between a clear "iss" sound and a more conversational "iz" sound. Harris ends with an obvious "iss." So _Harris's_ is pretty easy to say. The last syllable of Moses, by contrast, often sounds more like an "iz" than an "iss" when spoken naturally. And that leaves many people preferring _Moses'_ instead of attempting the more challenging _Moses's_.

The longer forms (Moses's and Jesus's) are not technically wrong, just slightly awkward. In his 1997 usage guide _The King's English_, novelist Kingsley Amis has this advice about deciding what merits an exception: "When in doubt always write out the fuller version."


**Avoid being fooled by familiar-sounding roots**
**Sometimes we hear a root that sounds singular** (e.g., _Eve_ or _Key_ in Ernie Eves and Alicia Keys). In these cases, we trick ourselves into writing s' instead of s's. **But the true test is whether we can actually read the sentence out loud and preserve the possessive:**

> 1\. Ernie Eves' first cabinet post. (Deceptive. Possessive sound lost, unless his name is Eve.)
>
> 2\. Ernie Eves's first cabinet post. **(PREFERRED)**
>
> 1\. Alicia Keys' job with BlackBerry. (Deceptive. Possessive sound lost unless her name is Key.)
>
> 2\. Alicia Keys's job with BlackBerry. **(PREFERRED)**
>
> 1\. CBC News' core values. **(Wrong. Cannot actually be said out loud. The _s's_ sound is required.)**
>
> 2\. CBC News's core values. **(PREFERRED)**


**In each of the examples above, the first sentences fail as true possessives.** Eve's and Key's work only if the surnames are Eve and Key. But when writing about the former Ontario politician Ernie Eves or the singer Alicia Keys, we need to retain their actual names regardless of familiar-sounding roots within.

**Although this problem is commonly associated with one-syllable words, monosyllabic names can be equally deceptive when they include familiar roots** (e.g., Williams becomes Williams's, even though the singular William's sounds OK because it's the natural and correct possessive of the singular "William").

> 1\. Russell Williams' wife refused to comment. (Deceptive. Possessive sound lost, unless his surname is William.)
>
> 2\. Russell Williams's wife refused to comment. **(PREFERRED)** 
>
> 1\. Bryan Adams' latest CD. (Deceptive. Possessive sound lost, unless his surname is Adam.)
>
> 2\. Bryan Adams's latest CD. **(PREFERRED)**
>
> 1\. Gabrielle Giffords' husband wept. (Deceptive. Possessive sound lost, unless her surname is Gifford.)
>
> 2\. Gabrielle Giffords's husband wept. **(PREFERRED)**

**Go with s' over s's on air if it's a lot easier to say**
While it's obvious that _Chris's scooter_ and _Paris's nightlife_ are correct, many guides point out that deciding whether to add the extra "s" sometimes involves personal judgment, especially in spoken English. To quote the stylebook published by [The Canadian Press](/home/c/cpap) (which we may happily call the Canadian Press's Stylebook): "If adding the extra 's' would make the word hard to say or grate on the ear, use an apostrophe alone."

But this does not mean suddenly adopting Charles' horse instead of Charles's horse, or Eves' budget instead of Eves's budget, since the longer forms in both cases are unquestionably preferred by convention, as outlined in the [overview](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s#overview) above.

> EXAMPLE 1: For consistency, CBC's style recommendation would be **_Bryan Adams's latest CD_** and **_Burton Cummings's comic book collection_**. We can be more relaxed in broadcast scripts and prefer a conversational version over a stilted one if the latter satisfies typographical conventions but causes us to stumble on air. At the same time, however, we must be sure to follow proper punctuation in written forms of text, on the web, in TV graphics, in email alerts, etc. In other words, **while Adams' or Cummings' would be acceptable on air, we must avoid the trap of accidentally publishing Adam's or Cumming's in text written for the eye.** 
>
> EXAMPLE 2: The preferred possessive of Gabrielle Giffords is s's (as in _Giffords's husband_). If broadcast staff find it significantly easier to say "Giffords' husband," they should feel free to adopt that form on air. But **we should still prefer Giffords's in online text, TV supers and banners, etc.** And no matter what, we need to **avoid the mistake of turning Giffords' husband into Gifford's husband — an easy error to make when we start letting our ears dictate what punctuation our fingers type.** 
>
> EXAMPLE 3: **An especially challenging pronunciation is sometimes caused by the word after the punctuation.** _Doris Chambers's estate_ is harder to say than _Doris Chambers's car_ because of the first syllable of the noun being possessed (i.e., **the "ess" sound of "estate"**). In this case, **_Doris Chambers' estate_** would be unquestionably preferred, while _Doris Chambers' car_ would be OK but debatable. And we would need to guard against either of these shortened versions accidentally becoming Chamber's estate or Chamber's car in text for the eye. **Once an acceptable version is chosen, it's best to be consistent throughout a story** (i.e., don't go with Chambers's in one paragraph and Chambers' in another). And **keep in mind: Recasting a sentence to avoid a tricky construction is sometimes best** (e.g., "her estate" rather than "Chambers's estate" or "Chambers' estate"), as pointed out in [Avoid unnecessary possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s#unnecessary) below.


**When judging what's easier to say on air, keep in mind that we often add an "s" to words that end in "z" without blinking an eye or tripping over our tongue**, even though we're producing the equivalent of an "s's" sound:

> the quiz's last question
>
> Aaron Hernandez's home
>
> showbiz's biggest names



**RELATED STYLE POINTS WORTH NOTING**


**Leafs versus Leafs'**
**Be sure to distinguish between a true possessive and a mere description:**

> The Leafs winger liked Beatles songs.
>
> The Leafs' last Stanley Cup victory was just before the Beatles' breakup.


**One tip is to consider whether the preposition "of" is appropriate** (as in the breakup of the Beatles) instead of "by" (as in songs by the Beatles) or "for" or "with," etc. In other words, there is a difference between writing about a Hemmingway novel or a Dickens novel and discussing Hemmingway's style or Dickens's style. A similar distinction is made between interviewing a Snowbirds pilot (i.e., a pilot with the aerobatics team known as the Snowbirds) and reporting on the Snowbirds' budget (i.e., the budget of the Snowbirds).

**Another tip deals with sports teams.** By substituting the name of the city or town the franchise is from, you can quickly see if a possessive is required:

> The Canadiens goalie was hit from behind.
>
>     (The Montreal goalie was hit from behind.)
>
> She called the Canadiens' winning streak impressive.
>
>     (She called Montreal's winning streak impressive.)


(See our **[possessive apostrophes overview](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)** for an in-depth review of true versus false possessives)


**Times's versus General Motors'**
**Some names that end with an "s" are considered singular** (_the New York Times is reporting_) **while others are treated as plural** (_the Beatles **were** famous and the Toronto Maple Leafs **are** on the road_).

These are generally straightforward, although **companies and countries that are normally singular** (_General Motors is losing money_) **are conventionally treated as plural in possessive structures:**

> He cited the New York Times's coverage of General Motors' debt.


**McDonald's and the Oakland A's**
**Sometimes apostrophes are embedded within names.** In the case of the McDonald's fast-food chain, for example, the proper noun includes a possessive. In the case of Oakland's baseball team, a word is being shortened through conventional use of punctuation (i.e., A's represents _Athletics_).

**Do not add an extra "s" or an extra apostrophe to these constructions to create possessives.** Instead, leave them as is:

> the Oakland A's manager
>
> McDonald's new CEO


**Tip: When confronted with this sort of possessive, an appealing option is to adopt different wording** (e.g., the _Athletics' manager_ or the _company's new CEO_), although this is not always possible, especially in headlines.

Oakland's name is yet another example of how apostrophes are not always intuitive. In the previous section, for instance, General Motors was correctly labelled singular (_General Motors is_), even though it takes a plural possessive (i.e., _General Motors' debt_). In the case of the Athletics, however, the team is treated as a plural despite the apostrophe before the "s" (i.e., _the A's **are** not the A's is_).

The plural of McDonald's, by the way, remains McDonald's (e.g., "They went to a McDonald's" and "She owns three McDonald's"). The embedded possessive, in other words, requires a different approach. It's not the same as, say, the name _Jones_, which becomes _Joneses_ in plural. But because McDonald's as a plural can look odd, it's often better to recast the sentence (e.g., "She owns three McDonald's restaurants").

See also [verb agreement](/home/v/verb-agreement) (e.g., "the Colorado Avalanche **are**" not "the Colorado Avalanche **is**") for related style points about sports teams, musical groups, etc.


**Avoid unnecessary possessives**
**Awkward or space-wasting possessives should be reworded whenever possible:**

> Correct: The bus's engine stalled in the middle of the intersection.
>
>     (**Better:** The bus stalled in the middle of the intersection.) 
>
> Correct: The buses all stop near Paris's Eiffel Tower.
>
>     (**Better:** The buses all stop near the Eiffel Tower.) 
>
> Correct: Both buses' passengers were shaken up by the accident.
>
>     (**Better:** Passengers on both buses were shaken up by the accident.) 
>
> Correct: CBC News's London bureau.
>
>     (**Better:** The CBC News London bureau.)


**Jones's versus Joneses'**
It's worth noting that **there's a big difference between a simple plural** (buses) **and a possessive one** (buses').

The **correct punctuation is often obvious.** Consider a story about the Smith family:


> **Smith's car** refers to one person's vehicle (e.g., Sid Smith's car).
>
> **The Smiths' car**, by contrast refers to the entire family's vehicle (i.e., all of the Smiths).


**As the facts change, however, the punctuation can become more complex** — such as when we stop talking about Sid Smith and his family and move on to discuss Janet Jones and her kin. "An accomplished apostrophe wielder," Kingsley Amis points out, "must be able to distinguish instantly between the following":

> He is staying with Janet **Jones**. (_One Jones_)
>
> He is staying at Janet **Jones's** house. (_One Jones_)
>
> He is staying with the **Joneses**. (_More than one Jones_.)
>
> He is staying at the **Joneses'** house. (**_More than one Jones_**.)


So if you want to keep up with the Joneses, visit the Joneses' place to see exactly what they've got (besides that dusty old book with Amis's autograph).

**able-bodied** (see [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#ablebodied))

**ABM** (**automated banking machine**; plural is **ABMs**) This abbreviation was once deeply entrenched in Canada. It remains in use, alongside the increasingly common synonym ATM (for automated teller machine). Both are OK, but be consistent within a given story. Neither needs to be spelled out. But be aware that the A stands for _automated_, not automatic. The Canadian Bankers Association still commonly calls its members' machines ABMs. The term [**ATM**](/home/a#ATM) is used more in the United States. Privately operated ATMS are frequently found at small Canadian businesses, including convenience stores. Generic labels such as "banking machine" or "automated teller" are fine in all contexts. Never write "ABM machine," which is redundant. See also [point-of-sale (POS) terminal](/home/p#POS).

**abduction** (generic term for taking people against their will). The word **kidnapping** generally implies a ransom or other specific demands. So while all kidnappings are abductions, not all abductions are viewed as kidnappings. Make sure the word you pick fits the facts, and that the context is clear to our audience.

**abnormal** (offensive when applied to people; see [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#abnormal))

**A-bomb**

**abominable snowman** (Prefer the term **yeti** when referring to the Himalayas. The plural is yetis. In stories about Canada, however, use **sasquatch** — a Salish word meaning "hairy men." In stories about reports of such human-like creatures in the U.S., the label **Bigfoot** is OK as long as the story makes it clear that they're also known as sasquatch. The words sasquatch and Bigfoot are both singular and plural.)

**Aboriginal** (adj.), as in Aboriginal people, Aboriginal self-government. Although once common as an adjective to describe all **Indians**, **Inuit** and **Métis** in Canada, **Indigenous** is now the preferred term, especially in first reference. Capitalize as a proper noun modifier. But do not use as a noun alone (i.e., refer to **Aboriginal people** rather than to "Aboriginals"). Also, avoid the offensive slang **Abo** and **Abos**. The word **Aborigine** refers to Australia's Indigenous people. See [**Indigenous**](/home/i/Indigenous) for detailed guidelines.

**abridgment**

**absenteeism** (_requires care_) Although it can technically mean simply being absent, the word **strongly implies being away for no valid reason.** Therefore, avoid using absenteeism unless verifiable facts match or the accusation of an unjustifiable absence is attributed. During COVID-19 pandemic coverage, for instance, we were accused of everything from ignorance and sloppiness to political bias when using "absenteeism" as the default noun in stories about employees missing work and students missing school. Recasting kept our journalism fact-based (e.g., referring to **rates of absence** or **attendance levels** or increased **absences**). Be aware that genuine absenteeism can be challenging to track. As Statistics Canada notes in its [labour force surveys](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/document/3701_D68_T25#b): "Although absenteeism is widely acknowledged to be a problem, it is not easy to quantify. The dividing line between avoidable and unavoidable is difficult to draw, and absenteeism generally masquerades as legitimate absence."

**action plan** (_avoid_ this cliché, which amounts to wordy spin) Just as reporting on an "inaction plan" would suggest something negative, reporting on an "action plan" automatically implies something good. A plan is a plan, no matter what modifier others attach to it. By dropping adjectives such as "action" in cases like this, we keep our sentences shorter and our journalism neutral.

**[active voice](/home/a/active-voice)** (subject-verb-object) Often, but not always, better than a passive construction.

**actor** (OK for both men and women) In some contexts, the word **actress** is both fine and unavoidable, such as in coverage of the Academy Awards. But be consistent throughout a story. Do not refer to a woman as an actress in one paragraph and then as an actor in the next. And if you add the adjective female (usually not necessary) before the word actor (female actor), be sure to include the adjective male as well when referring to men in the same story (male actor). Otherwise, leave out both modifiers.

**ACTRA** (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists)

**AD** (does not need to spelled out as _anno Domini_, which means "in the year of the Lord") Unlike [BC](/home/b#BC), the abbreviation AD goes before the figure, as in "AD 79." When labelling centuries, however, the letters are conventionally placed at the end, as in "the second century AD."

**adjuvant**, **adjuvant-free** vaccine, **non-adjuvant** vaccine (_avoid_ the disputed construction "_unadjuvant_") The term adjuvant comes from the Latin word for "help." Since it's technical jargon, it should be briefly explained in news stories (e.g., in a piece about [vaccines](/home/i/immunization-vaccination), adjuvant can be defined as an "immune booster"). See [bacteria-virus](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) for more details and related guidelines.

**administration** (lowercase, even for **U.S. administration**, **Bush administration**, **Obama administration**, etc.) While this term is fine for American politics, do not use it to describe Canadian governments. In parliamentary systems, the legislative and executive branches are combined. (See also [regime](/home/r#regime) for related guidelines)

**adrenalin** (_not_ adrenaline) Use the shorter spelling (without the second "e") for the natural hormones secreted by the adrenal gland (epinephrine and cortin) as well as for various manufactured stimulants. Generic forms of synthetic adrenalin feature a lowercase "a." Unless specifically referring to the trademarked drug Adrenalin, a capital letter is not required. (See also [EpiPen](/home/e#epipen) and [trademarks](/home/t/trade-names))

**Adventist, Seventh-day**

**adverse** (contrary, unfavourable); **averse** (reluctant)

**advertise** (_not_ -ize)

**adviser** (_not_ "–or" except in rare cases) For consistency, the preferred spelling is "-er" in virtually all contexts: **campaign adviser, close adviser, national security adviser**, etc. The main exception is in banking where both spellings are used in order to distinguish a licensed **financial adviser** from an unregulated **financial advisor**. (See [adviser versus advisor](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/adviser/ "Adviser") for details)

**al-Shabaab** (Somali-based militants linked to al-Qaeda) In March 2010, the federal government added al-Shabaab to Canada's list of terrorist groups. Avoid other spellings, such as Shebab and Shabab. See [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) for general guidelines. For more background on al-Shabaab, see the [CBCNews.ca feature](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fworld%2Fstory%2F2010%2F03%2F09%2Ff-somalia-al-shabaab.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1S-pnrBaiFEXPcO0Foa_U5) about the organization.

**all-star** (n. and adj.), as in _She's an all-star_ and _He's an all-star hitter_. Use uppercase letters only for the proper names of teams (e.g., _baseball's National League All-Stars or hockey's Eastern Conference All-Stars_). Otherwise, keep the term lowercase (e.g., the NHL _all-star roster_, next month's _all-star game_, Mats Sundin leads this year's _all-star balloting_, etc.)

**all-terrain vehicle** (Since the abbreviation **ATV** is more obscure than say, SUV, generally spell out all-terrain vehicle at least once high in the story); **ATV trails**; **ATVers** (people who operate ATVs)

**ALS** ("amyotrophic lateral sclerosis" does not need to be spelled out in stories) It's common and acceptable to say that this neurodegenerative disorder is also known as **Lou Gehrig's disease**. (See [health reporting](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/health_reporting/#clarity "Health_reporting") for related guidelines on clear writing.)

**alternate** (one after the other); **alternative** (one or the other)

**alt-right** (shorthand for "alternative right") An increasingly common term for a [far-right](/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing) political movement normally tied to **white nationalism**. Should be briefly defined in stories whenever practical to make links to intolerance clear. While alt-right is an umbrella label that does not have a universally agreed on meaning, it can be described as a movement that rejects mainstream conservatism in favour of promoting white identity and espousing ideas widely seen as antisemitic, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, etc. A given story's focus may affect the description chosen (e.g., if you're reporting on alt-right opposition to multiculturalism instead of on alt-right comments about Islam or transgender rights). No need to put alt-right in quotation marks. Adding the modifier "so-called" is optional. (See also [white nationalism](/home/w#white_nationalism))

**aluminum** (_not_ -inium)

**alumnus** (plural **alumni**) A graduate of a specific school. Although "alumnus" is the masculine singular form in Latin, it's now **widely considered gender-neutral in English**. Therefore, prefer it over the comparatively obscure "alum." There's usually no need to use what was traditionally the feminine singular Latin form "alumna," or its plural "alumnae," outside of direct quotes. (See also [emeritus](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/e/#emeritus "E"))

**Alzheimer's disease** (named after German physician Alois Alzheimer, who first identified it in 1906) It's the most common form of [dementia](/home/d/dementia) in Canada. Treat the disease as a possessive (Alzheimer's) based on convention, but be aware that the apostrophe is missing from the official spellings of some proper nouns (e.g., the **Alzheimer Society of Canada**). See the editorial caveat under [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#alzheimersdown) (Down versus Alzheimer's) for details.

**Al Wefaq** (no hyphen) Bahrain's largest [Shia](/home/s#shia) party. There's generally no need to spell out the full name, Al Wefaq National Islamic Society. See also [Arabic names](/home/a/arabic-names) for broad guidelines on transliterations.

**a.m., p.m.** (lowercase) 3 a.m. AT, 7:45 p.m. MT, etc. (See also [time](/home/t/time))

**_a mari usque ad mare_** (Canada's official motto, "from sea to sea") Unless Latin is part of everyday speech (such as "ad nauseam" or "per diem"), it should be posted in [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**ambassador**, the Syrian **ambassador**, Syrian **Ambassador** Ahmad Arnous (capitalize before a name) See also [titles](/home/t/titles) and [embassy](/home/e#embassy)

**Amber Alert** (special bulletins to notify the public about a recent child abduction)

**amendment, Fifth Amendment** (U.S.)

**America** (n.) Historically avoided as a synonym for the U.S. in Canada. Limited use is OK when there's a strong editorial reason. (See **[United States](/home/u/united-states)** for details); **American** (adj., n.) OK when referring to the country's citizens.

**anti-abortion** (not "pro-life") See [abortion](/home/a/abortion) for more detailed guidelines.

**anti-ballistic missiles** (**ABMs** in headlines or second reference) Avoid the term "ABM missiles," which is actually "anti-ballistic missiles missiles" along the lines of "NDP Party" for "New Democratic Party Party."

[**antisemitic**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#antisemitic) (See also [Jews](/home/j#Jews))

**anti-terrorism, Anti-terrorism Act** (lowercase "t" after the hyphen) This is the official name of the legislation passed by Canada's Parliament. It became law in December 2001. (See [terrorism](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) for important editorial guidelines. See [Act versus act](/home/a/act) as well as [anti-](/home/a/anti-versus-anti) for related capitalization and punctuation rules.)

**AP** (see [**The Associated Press**](/home/c/cpap))

**apartheid**

**apartment** versus **Apartment** or **Apt.** (see [addresses](/home/a/addresses))

**APEC** (OK in first reference) **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation** (Do not put a hyphen in co-operation in this case because it's a proper noun) Technically, APEC is not a group of "countries" but an agreement by more than 20 regional "economies" to hold regular meetings to discuss common interests. Use of the word "economies" permits China, Taiwan and Hong Kong to have their own representatives at the table without controversy over sovereignty. APEC members include Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and the United States. For a complete list, as well as more information, consult the [organization's website](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apec.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2eya_bzehZB8J_-4kI_BeN).

**apology, apologize** (_requires caution_) Conventionally refers to acknowledgment of an error, a failure, a transgression, etc. Contrition is normally implied. Avoid calling the mere recognition of something an apology. For example, simply stating that a given act has had regrettable consequences, or acknowledging the emotional distress of others, is not on its own an apology. Be aware that terms like "sorry" and "regret" can be misinterpreted or mischaracterized. For instance, if a country says that it's "sorry" civilians were killed in a bombing, the word "sorry" alone does not mean the government has "apologized" for the bombing. Instead, the country has simply expressed regret that civilians were killed. The distinction is subtle but significant. As always, carefully prepared statements by politicians, military leaders, private companies, etc., merit special scrutiny to keep our journalism accurate.

**apostle, John the Apostle, the Apostle Paul, the Twelve Apostles**

**apostrophes** (see [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

**app** (computer application) OK in first reference, as in a **mobile app**, an **iPad app** (See also [internet terms](/home/i/internet-terms))

**appal, appalled, appalling**

**apparatus, apparatuses**

**Appeal Court** versus **Court of Appeals** (see [courts](/home/c/courts))

**appendix, appendixes**

**April** (never abbreviate) See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)

**April Fools' Day** (April 1) Prefer the plural possessive. This increasingly common punctuation (Fools') was adopted by CP, CBC News and others in 2013 to conform with modern convention. Many authorities had previously listed April Fool's, including the 2004 Canadian Oxford. See also [special dates](/home/h/holidays) for general capitalization guidelines (e.g., _New Year's Eve_ but _election day_)

**Aqua-Lung** (a specific type of underwater breathing device) See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names)

**arbour** (a shady alcove, a garden bower); but **Arbor Day, arborist, arboreal, arboretum**, etc. See ["or" versus "our"](/home/s/spelling/our) endings for related guidelines

**Archbishop** (capitalize when part of a full title or before a name) _Archbishop Christian Lépine thanked them; Cardinal Gérald Lacroix, the Archbishop of Quebec, agreed; the Archbishop of Toronto laughed at her joke;_ **archbishop** (lowercase for general references and plural constructions) _the archbishops met; the archbishop smiled_. Unless the title archbishop is directly relevant to the story, it's often easiest and sufficient to refer to the person as a [cardinal](/home/c#cardinal) when the person also holds that title.

**archaeological, archaeologist, archaeology** (not _arche-_) Spelling change adopted in the fall of 2022 for reasons outlined in our [lingering ligatures](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/spelling/lingering-ligatures/ "Lingering ligatures") overview.

**Arctic**, **Arctic Circle**, **Arctic air** (literal) but **arctic chill** (figurative). See [**Arctic, High Arctic, Far North, North**](/home/a/arctic) for detailed guidelines

**ardour** (enthusiasm, zeal) _not_ -or (See also [our versus or](/home/s/spelling/our))

**arduous** (difficult)

**Argentine** (n. and adj.) Citizens of Argentina are traditionally called Argentines. Prefer over "Argentinians." Argentine is also the recommended adjective (e.g., Argentine oil workers, Argentine music). When government documents in Argentina are translated from Spanish to English, Argentine remains the preferred word. Many Western news organizations, including CP, the New York Times and the Globe and Mail, recommend Argentine over Argentinian as well. When transcribing clips that feature the latter, avoid the rogue spelling "Argentinean."

**argyle** socks, sweater, etc. (_don't use argyll except when used in an official name,_ e.g., Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada)

**Arizona (Ariz.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**Arkansas (Ark.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**armada** (warships) The "arm" in armada refers to armed vessels. Avoid using this word to describe a group of boats or small ships that have no weapons. Use **fleet** (which commonly suggests one owner) or **flotilla** instead. See also [boat versus ship](/home/b/boat-versus-ship)

**Armed Forces, the Forces** (capital letters for Canadian troops only) See [military forces](/home/m/military-forces)

**Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day** (annual day in April marking First World War mass killings widely called the **Armenian genocide**) See [genocide](/home/g/genocide) for important, related editorial caveats

**arm's-length** (attributive adjective) See [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)

**army** versus **Army** (see [military forces](/home/m/military-forces))

**arrant** (utter, as in _arrant nonsense;_ and notorious, as in an _arrant liar_) The word has nothing to do with error. Also, do not confuse with [**errant**](/home/e#errant), which suggests wandering.

**art**

Lowercase art styles, schools, movements, etc., such as **art deco, art nouveau, baroque, cubism, impressionism, and neoclassical**, unless the word is derived from a proper noun (e.g., **Gothic, Norman** and **Romanesque**) or could be confused with a common word (e.g., **Dada** and **Renaissance**). Most compound nouns featuring the word "art" are two words (e.g., **art exhibit, art form, art gallery**). The term **artwork**, however, is fused.

**arteriosclerosis**

**arthroscopic, arthroscopy**

an **article**, but the third paragraph of **Article 7** (formal name), and "**Art. 5, Sec. 1,** outlines the restrictions" (For related guidelines, see [series](/home/n/numbers#series) in the numbers overview)

**artifact**

**artificial intelligence (AI)** Conventionally refers to computer systems or machines that seem to mimic certain cognitive abilities of animals, such as learning and problem solving. AI (no periods) should be spelled out at least once, early on, in stories. (See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general typographical guidelines)

**artwork** (fused) See [art](/home/a#art) above for examples of two-word compounds

**Aryan Nations** (white supremacist group)

**ASA** (OK in first reference to **acetylsalicylic acid**) See also [Aspirin](/home/a#Aspirin) below

**Ash Wednesday**

**asinine**

**Asperger's syndrome** (capital A, possessive apostrophe; **Asperger's** OK, even in first reference) Named after Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger. Conventionally referred to as a mild form of autism. Technically, it falls under the broad medical heading of **[autism spectrum disorder](/home/a#autism)** (an umbrella term), which is why the variation **Asperger's disorder** has become increasingly common. **Some authorities no longer list Asperger's as a separate autism diagnosis. But the proper noun is entrenched and OK when the facts fit and individuals and medical staff, themselves use the name.** People with Asperger's may have average to high intelligence, as well as narrow — sometimes intensely focused — interests, but find certain verbal and nonverbal social skills challenging. The condition is sometimes spelled without a possessive apostrophe. For consistency, however, include the punctuation in our reporting unless referring to a proper noun that's rendered differently (e.g., **Asperger Manitoba**). Be aware that some organizations have changed their names because of what they described as newly documented links between Hans Asperger and Nazis during the Second World War (e.g., the **Asperger's Society of Ontario** was rebranded as the **ASO** in 2020). See also [possessive apostrophes](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe/#alzheimersdown "Possessive apostrophe") for related typographical conventions (e.g., Parkinson's disease but Down syndrome).

**attaché, attaché case** (see also [French accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents))

**ATM** (**automated teller machine**; plural is **ATMs**) This abbreviation is deeply entrenched in the United States and increasingly common in Canada. There's no need to spell it out, but be aware that the A stands for _automated_, not automatic. The term [**ABM**](/home/a#ABM) is also used in Canada. ATM and ABM are both acceptable in our journalism, but be consistent within a single story. Generic names such as "banking machine" or "automated teller" are fine in all contexts. Never write "ATM machine," which is redundant.

**AT&T** (OK in first reference to **American Telephone and Telegraph Co.**) See also guidelines on [ampersand](/home/a/ampersand)

**attorney** (lowercase as generic term for lawyer or prosecutor, such as Crown attorney Betty Shanks and power of attorney); **Attorney** (capitalized only when part of a unique title directly before a person's name (e.g., **U.S. Attorney Damian Williams**). This capitalization applies regardless of whether a specific regional locator is included (e.g., **U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York**). Keep "attorney" lowercase if the person is a deputy (e.g., **assistant U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon**) as well as when the title is not directly followed by a name (e.g., **the U.S. attorney said**, the assistant U.S. attorney said). Be aware that there are nearly 100 U.S. attorneys in charge of enforcing federal law in districts across the United States. The U.S. Justice Department website offers details about these positions, including the names of current office holders. (See also [titles](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/titles/ "Titles") for general capitalization guidelines)

**attorney general, attorneys general, Attorney General Debra Wong** (See also [titles](/home/t/titles) and [general as a suffix](/home/g/generalsuffix))

**attribution** (see [quotes](/home/q/quotes-overview) overview)

**audiotape** (one word for both the noun and the verb)

**Auger-Aliassime, Félix**

**Aung San Suu Kyi** (pro-democracy leader in **[Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar)** for several decades, and winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize) **Suu Kyi** OK in second reference and web headlines, as explained more fully in the [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) overview.

**authorize**

**autism spectrum disorder** (commonly known as **autism**) A neurological condition associated with different degrees of **autism** and **[Asperger's syndrome](/home/a#Aspergers)**. The umbrella term **ASD** should be spelled out in first reference, if used at all. The disorder typically includes varying degrees of difficulty with communication (verbal and nonverbal), which can make social interaction challenging. People with autism spectrum disorder may also repeat certain behaviour, and have a limited number of interests, which they pursue intensely. NOTE: It's common and generally acceptable to use the clipped term autism alone in stories. Furthermore, **the term [autistic](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/disability-language/#autistic "Disability language") is usually recommended** over "person with autism" in generic references.

**automaker, autoworker** (but **Canadian Auto Workers** with a space and [no apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#propernouns) because _Workers_ is treated as descriptive not possessive in this proper noun) The CAW merged with another union in 2013 to become [**Unifor**](/home/u#Unifor).

**automated banking machine** ([ABM](/home/a#ABM), plural **ABMs**); **automated teller machine** ([**ATM**](/home/a#ATM), plural ATMs). In both cases, the A stands for _automated_, not automatic. ABM is the more common term in Canada.

**autonomous vehicles** (implies no human backup) Narrowly refers to vehicles that can operate without the need for people to monitor driving decisions (speed, steering, braking), or to survey the environment for possible safety concerns. When manufacturers assess autonomous vehicles on public roadways, it's clearest to call them **autonomous test vehicles** (i.e., the technology is intended to be autonomous, but there are still human beings on board to supervise). Differentiate between **fully autonomous** (driverless) and **partially automated vehicles**, also increasingly referred to as **semi-autonomous vehicles**. The latter feature a range of **driver-assist systems**. While such technology can perform certain tasks (e.g., changing lanes, maintaining specific distances from traffic directly ahead) human supervision is still required. Many automakers now have their own versions of partially automated driving systems. When reporting on these vehicles, use capital letters to identify the names as proprietary (e.g., Nissan's **ProPilot Assist** and Tesla's **Autopilot** versus the generic word **autopilot**).

**avant-garde** (see also [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for general guidelines)

**Avenue** versus **avenue** (See [addresses](/home/a/addresses))

**averse** (reluctant); **adverse** (contrary, unfavourable)

**avian influenza** (lowercase); **avian flu** (acceptable in first reference); **bird flu** (acceptable in second reference). Since there are many forms of avian flu, be sure to specify whether the type you're writing about threatens people's health.

**awhile** (an adverb) "They talked awhile." But use **a while** after prepositions such as _for, in_, etc. ("They talked for a while" and "It may take a while" and "Every once in a while.") In this case, _while_ is a noun. **A good test:** Use the fused version (awhile) only if the phrase "for a while" can replace it.

**AWOL** (OK in first reference; does not need to be spelled out as "**absent without leave**") The preferred Canadian shorthand used to be AWL, but the acronym AWOL is now common and acceptable. (See also [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview#AWOL))

**axe** (_not_ ax)

**axel** (lowercase) This figure-skating jump, named after a Norwegian athlete, was capitalized for many years. It's now lowercase, however, because of common usage, as in a **double axel**, a **triple axel**, etc. (See also [salchow](/home/s#salchow) and [lutz](/home/l#lutz))

**axis** (plural **axes**), but **the Axis** when referring to the Second World War alliance of Germany, Italy and Japan.

**Azerbaijan**

**Aziz, Tariq** (_not_ Tarek or Tareq) Iraq's former deputy prime minister, under Saddam Hussein

**AZT** (Abbreviation sufficient on first reference. If spelled out, prefer [zidovudine](/home/z#zidovudine) over azidothymidine.) See also [**AIDS**](/home/a/aids)

****

### a versus an

**An is used before any word, abbreviation or symbol** (e.g. number) **that begins with a vowel sound.** So it's an _MP_ and an _11-kilometre road_.



**a historic (a helpful rule)**
**Most words that begin with "h" are aspirated** (i.e., the "h" is sounded when spoken). **Always use "a" in these cases** (e.g., _a hotel, a holiday, a history professor,_ and _a historic moment_).


**an hour**
**A few words begin with an unaspirated "h"** (one that isn't sounded when spoken). **These take "an"** (e.g., _an hour, an heir, an honest,_ and _an honour_).

-   See the Pronunciation Database for a note about [a's vowel sound](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D28489&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0V-XY-fClDxHg-K-zI1oxz) ("ay," as in hay, versus "ah," as in hah).

Note: The title prime minister is always lowercase when the position is no longer held (i.e., former Palestinian prime minister Mahmoud Abbas), but uppercase when currently held and directly before the person's name (Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas). See [titles](/home/t/titles)

Although he goes by more than one name, CBC News always uses Abbas in first reference. If necessary, write "Abbas, also known as _Abu Mazen_" later in the story (if the word Mazen appears in a web quote or in a clip from television or radio). Then revert to using Abbas.

**TV TEXT REMINDER:** Be aware that television graphics, banners, supers, etc., have some unique typographical conventions that don't always match the basics highlighted below. The biggest difference is the use of more initial capital letters in titles, job descriptions, etc. (e.g., "Former Prime Minister" instead of former prime minister, and "High School Principal" instead of high school principal). See the [**TV Text overview**](/home/t/tv_text) for details.

**Uppercase**
**In most cases, do not put periods in abbreviations formed entirely out of capital letters** (_AIDS, BA, MA, MP, RCMP, SARS, SOB, UBC, URL, UN, VIP, etc._) **unless they refer to geographic locations** (_B.C., P.E.I., U.S._). See [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms) for more information about abbreviations pronounced as words.

One notable exception involves convention, such as the colloquial abbreviation _NYC_ for _New York City_. Although there's technically no C in the official name (i.e., it's _New York, N.Y_.), the abbreviation _NYC_ (without periods) has become entrenched. See [New York](/home/n#NewYork) for details.

Another common exception involves shortening a proper name to a letter or two, such as _"The mysterious witness was referred to as Mr. B."_ and _"Toronto is sometimes called T.O."_ But leave out this punctuation when the letters themselves function as the names of people or things, such as _"Exhibit A"_ or _"The identity of Lady X was never revealed."_ The periods should also be dropped if the letters are functioning as mere abbreviations, such as _ET_ for extraterrestrial versus [_E.T._](/home/e#ET) as the name of an extraterrestrial movie character.

See [Single letters (Madame X but Mr. D.)](/) below for more guidelines and examples.

See [When and how to spell out](/home/a/abbreviations#whenandhow) for related guidelines (e.g., _GST_ becomes _goods and services tax_ while a proper noun such as _UN_ becomes _[United Nations](/home/u/united-nations)_).

**Do not put periods in geographical abbreviations used to brand currency** (_$300 US, $450 Cdn_) See [money](/home/m/money) for more guidelines.

See also [Geographical components of proper nouns](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents) below (B.C. Hydro, not 'BC Hydro,' but DriveBC).


**Lowercase**
**Virtually all entirely lowercase abbreviations take punctuation**.

Condensed terms commonly end in **one period**: _etc., ft., lb., misc., oz., qt., vol., yd._

Initialisms, by contrast, feature **two or more periods**: _e.g., a.k.a., a.m., i.e., m.p.h., p.m., s.o.b._

But see [single-letter abbreviations below](#singleletters) for exceptions (e.g., mind your _p's_ and _q's_), as well as [acronyms](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/acronyms/ "Acronyms") for lowercase initialisms that are now words (e.g., _laser_ and _scuba_).

CAUTION: Metric symbols are NOT considered true abbreviations, and, so, do not take periods on their own (_cm, km, ha, mm_) or when combined with other units (_km/h_ and _m/s_). Be aware, however, that neighbouring lowercase units sometimes take periods (_cu. cm, sq. m_), depending on convention. See [measurements below](#measurements) for details. A table of common metric shorthand is included in our [imperial versus metric overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/metric-versus-imperial/#abbreviating "Metric versus imperial").


**Mixed (uppercase, lowercase)**
**Most abbreviations made up of lowercase and mixed letters take periods** (_Mr., Mrs., Sgt., B.Comm.,_ etc.) **but there are exceptions** (_Miss_. for _Mississippi_ but _Miss_ as in _Miss Jones_). **In general, use Jr. or Sr. only with a person's full name**, and do not add a comma unless more abbreviations follow (_Edgar Bronfman Jr. may try to buy the company_ versus _The letter was signed "Joe Jones Jr., PhD"_).

**Do not put periods in mixed abbreviations that begin and end with capital letters** (_PhD, PoW, MiG, U of T_).

**Do not put spaces in abbreviations made up of big and small letters** (_B.Ed., M.Sc., P.Eng._) **unless they're separated by a word and don't have periods** (U of A). See also [degrees](/home/d/degrees).

**Sometimes abbreviations lose most or all of their capital letters** (_Nabisco_ instead of NABISCO for what used to be the National Biscuit Company, and _scuba_ for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus), **depending on convention and in-house style.** For instance, we write the _U.S. Patriot Act_ instead of _USA PATRIOT Act_, even though the legislation was formally called "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism" when passed in 2001. **One consideration is whether such abbreviations form an existing common word** (in this case, "patriot"). Even though the White House itself has flipped between the USA PATRIOT Act and the Patriot Act for several years, we stick with the U.S. Patriot Act — along with AP, CP, the BBC and many other news organizations. See also [NORAD](/home/n#NORAD) (which some news organizations spell as "Norad" to avoid five or more uppercase letters).


**Little words usually dropped (SCC, not SCOC)**
**Abbreviations generally include principal words only.** So it's _BA_ (not "_BoA_" or "_BOA_") for _Bachelor of Arts_, _AFN_ (not "_AoFN_" or "_AOFN_") for _Assembly of First Nations_, [SCC](/home/s#SupremeCourt) (not "_SCoC_" or "_SCOC_") for _Supreme Court of Canada_, _CMHC_ (not "_CMaHC_" or "_CMAHC_") for _Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation_, _GST_ (not "_GaST_" or "_GAST_") for _goods and services tax_, _ETA_ (not "_EToA_" or "_ETOA_") for _estimated time of arrival_, etc.

Occasionally, prepositions, conjunctions and other small words are included in short forms, either based on convention (_PoW_ for _Prisoner of War_, with the "o" lowercase) or because they're needed to make the letters pronounceable, such as the I in _NIMBY_ (for _not in my backyard_). But these are exceptions.


**FAQs about VIPs that mind their p's and q's**
**Add apostrophes to plural forms of INDIVIDUAL letters , whether lowercase or capitalized**, to make it easier to scan the text (p's and q's, X's and O's). This applies to SINGLE letters of the alphabet only. **But do NOT add apostrophes to form the plurals of clusters of capital letters or numbers** (ABCs, FAQs, MPs, SOBs, 1950s, the Dirty '30s, 747s). See also [apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes) and [time](/home/t/time#1950s), as well as [single letters ("p" or P, etc.)](#singleletters) below for a 2023 style change summary.


**Dates**
**Do not abbreviate or put commas after months standing alone or that are followed only by the year.**


> _November 2002 was a month she will never forget._
>
> _He goes to a cottage every August._
>
> _Security at airports was never the same after September 2001._
>
> _She was killed in the July 2005 London bombings._


**Put commas after both the month and the year in specific dates.** In these cases, **abbreviate only months that have more than five letters: Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov.** and **Dec.**


> _The ship sank on Feb. 3, 1917._
>
> _On Oct. 16, 1970, the federal government proclaimed the [War Measures Act](/home/e#EmergenciesAct)._
>
> _They cashed the cheque on March 22, 1997, nine months after the lottery draw._
>
> _The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks changed everything._
>
> _He's a suspect in the July 7, 2005, London bombings._


**Do not include ordinal notation** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) **unless the sentence's syntax requires it** (e.g., in a prepositional construction).


> _On July 7, 2005, ..._
>
> _On the 7th of July, 2005, ..._
>
> _... before Oct. 2, 2012._
>
> _... before the 2nd of October._

**Addresses and roads**
**Generally abbreviate words like Street, Avenue, etc. when numbers that are not part of the road's name** (41st Avenue) **appear in the address** (622 41st Ave.), **except in rare cases established by convention** (e.g., an official government residence). **This applies to major highways**, even in headlines (e.g., write Highway 27 instead of "Hwy. 27"). Do not use hyphens between numbers or between numbers and letters. **Points of the compass** (north, east, etc.) **become a single letter** followed by a period unless they're part of the official name (West Hastings). Blended quadrants follow standard compass abbreviation (southeast becomes S.E.):


> _Yonge Street_
>
> _599B Yonge St._
>
> _205 Wellington St. W._
>
> _101 West Hastings St._
>
> _110th Street S.E._
>
> _5925 110th St. S.E._
>
> _North Service Road_
>
> _3900 North Service Rd._
>
> _24 Sussex Drive_
>
> _10 Downing Street_
>
> _Highway 401_
>
> _Trans-Canada Highway_


See [addresses](/home/a/addresses) for more examples, including guidelines on _Apt_. versus _Apartment_ or _apartment_, and on spelling out ordinal numbers under 10 (_First_ rather than _1st_).


**Provinces, states and countries**

**NOTE: This section focuses on standard text in stories**, including headlines, subheads, photo captions and the main bodies of web articles. **Maps, graphics, etc., sometimes require more condensed abbreviations**, as noted below.


**With the exception of** British Columbia (**B.C.**), Prince Edward Island (**P.E.I.**) and the Northwest Territories (**N.W.T.**), **do not abbreviate provincial or territorial names unless they appear after cities, towns or other communities in the main body of a story.**
_
They bought a farm near Purple Springs, Alta., in 1955.
She was born in Quebec in 1970.
He died in a plane crash near Fort McPherson, N.W.T., three years ago._

**In these cases, always use a comma after the community and a second comma after the province, territory or** (when relevant) **country.** This is a standard publishing convention to aid readers. The additional information is treated as a subordinate fragment that could be removed without changing the sentence's flow or meaning:


> _He took the train from Milan, Italy, to Stuttgart, Germany, last week._
>
> _The bus left Chilliwack, B.C., at 3 p.m._
>
> _Gillian Jones of Pictou, N.S., was first._


By framing extra details with commas, the eye scans the key points more quickly:


> _He took the train from Italy to Germany last week._
>
> _The bus left Chilliwack at 3 p.m._
>
> _Gillian Jones of Nova Scotia was first._


**NOTE: When a geographical reference is used as compound adjective, it's generally best to recast the sentence** so that the second comma doesn't disrupt the sentence's flow.


> _They started a Surrey, B.C., company that created jobs for dozens of ..._ (OK but somewhat jarring)
>
> _They started a company in Surrey, B.C., that created jobs for dozens of ..._ (Preferred)

**
Never shorten [Yukon](/home/y/yukon) or Nunavut**:


> _The fire began at the base of a mountain near Faro, Yukon, a community of about 500 people_.
>
> _Rassi Nashalik is a proud Inuk from Pangnirtung, Nunavut, and was a trailblazer in Canadian media._


**When abbreviations are appropriate, use the following: N.W.T., B.C., Alta., Sask., Man., Ont., Que., N.B., N.S., P.E.I.,** and **N.L.** ([not Nfld.](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador)). **Always include periods.**

**In web headlines**, provincial abbreviations are often used to save space. But they're not mandatory (e.g., Alberta or Alta. are both fine). Do not shorten Yukon or Nunavut. Do not abbreviate Canada or Canadian outside of currency references (see [Money](/home/m/money#CdnUS) for details). The abbreviation **Nfld.** is sometimes used in web headlines, but only in rare cases when referring to the island itself (e.g., "southern Nfld," spelled out as "southern Newfoundland" in the main story). **Labrador is never abbreviated when used on its own**, even in web headlines.

See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#maps-graphics) for details on why **two-character postal abbreviations like AB and MB are restricted to maps, graphics, etc.**, where space constraints are typically severe.

Pairs of commas are also used when naming most communities around the globe:


> _She moved to Great Falls, Mont., in 1944._
>
> _He was born in Florence, Italy, during the Second World War._


**For details on which cities can stand alone in copy** (without the name of a province, state or country after them), see [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities), [U.S. abbreviations](/home/u/united-states), and [cities around the world](/home/g/geography-cities).


**Geographical components of proper nouns** (B.C. Hydro, not 'BC Hydro;' but DriveBC)
**Include periods in the geographical components of virtually all proper nouns**, regardless of whether an organization or government agency has dropped the punctuation from its registered name.


> Ballet B.C.
>
> B.C. Coroners Service
>
> B.C. Ferries
>
> B.C. Place
>
> B.C. Hydro
>
> B.C. Wildfire Service
>
> Elections B.C.
>
> Finance P.E.I.
>
> N.B. Power
>
> N.B. Research and Productivity Council
>
> P.E.I. Pass


**The only exceptions are rare cases of fused spellings** and other unorthodox typography, **as well as routine, all-uppercase initialisms:**


> DriveBC
>
> FortisBC
>
> NSGC (spelled out as Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation)
>
> SaskPower
>
> UBC
>
> UCLA
>
> UPEI
>
> WorkplaceNL

> WorkSafeBC
>
> WorkSafeNB



**SIMPLIFIED STYLE:** CBC News adopted the streamlined approach above in August of 2021 to address confusion over the growing number of exceptions to standard typography. Organizations were increasingly removing periods from geographical abbreviations, often capriciously and sometimes temporarily. Journalists, in turn, were stuck with the time-consuming task of verifying arbitrary spellings advocated by branding consultants. Certain usage was inconsistent (e.g., the "**B.C. Coroner's Act**" referred to the "BC Coroners Service," and the "**B.C. Pavilion Corporation**" decided to change the spelling of a stadium to "BC Place"). The Canadian Press, CBC and other news organizations, meanwhile, wound up hard pressed to explain why we had, say, embraced "NB Power" but still insisted on the "**P.E.I. Liquor Control Commission**" — even though the latter was listed as "PEI" on the provincial government's website — or why the "**B.C. Liberal Party**" was normally used even though "BC Liberal Party" appeared in a lot of the organization's advertising. The Beast of Ad Hoc Punctuation had been unleashed. Before slaying it, we weighed the pros of matching the stated preferences of organizations for certain spellings against the cons of ignoring the jarring incongruity caused by erratic divergences from traditional typography. In the end, we decided that it was in the best interest of our writers and editors, as well as our audience, to re-impose conventional publishing rules about periods in routine geographical shorthand, regardless of whether the abbreviations were standalone modifiers or elements of proper names.


**It's a myth that external typography must be matched verbatim to maintain the principle of accuracy.** See [stylistic latitude](/home/s/spelling#stylisticlatitude) in the spelling overview for details.

As noted in the [previous section](/home/a/abbreviations#Provinces), **we use standard geographical abbreviations (B.C., Alta., Ont.) rather than two-letter postal symbols (BC, AB, ON)** in most of our journalism. Exceptions are permitted in maps, graphics, etc., where space is precious. For details, see [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#abbreviating).


**Measurements**
**Do not add periods to metric terms** (_mm, cm, km_), **but keep them in long-established imperial abbreviations** (_lb., yd., sq. ft._). **Do not add an "s" to form plurals** (_10 km_ never kms, and _100 lb._ never lbs.). See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial).

**In general, all these terms should be spelled out** (_feet, kilogram, minute, hour, metre,_ etc.) unless they appear in graphic tables. **A few common measurements**, however, **can be abbreviated** in stories (_50 km/h, 9-mm pistol,_ the old _60-m.p.h. limit_). **If a metric symbol appears at the end of a sentence, it takes a single period:** _100 km/h_.

See also [temperatures](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#temperatures).


**Single letters ("p" or P, etc.)**
[Lowercase single letters](/home/a/abbreviations#lowercasesingleletters) ("p" and p's)

[How to handle periods after single letters](/home/a/abbreviations#periodssingleletters) (Madame X but Mr. D.)


**Lowercase single letters ("p" and p's)**
**Use lowercase when citing a letter of the alphabet that's also lowercase in the word, abbreviation, etc., you're referring to. Add quotation marks** ("p") to help flag the letter, which can otherwise look like a typo, **unless an apostrophe already does this job** (p's) when a plural form is used:


> _Do not add an "s" to km or lb._
>
> _The "u" in scuba stands for underwater._
>
> _Nowadays, not everyone bothers to pronounce the "n" in government._
>
> _He had trouble saying r's and l's._
>
> _Mind your p's and q's._


See also [apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes) for uppercase and lowercase treatments of plurals (p's and q's versus VIPs, MPs, etc.)


**Uppercase single letters (P, ABCs, X's and O's)**
**Use a capital when the single letter of the alphabet is also uppercase in the word, abbreviation, etc., you're referring to. Quotation marks are generally unnecessary** to flag capital letters since they already stand out:


> _The T in NATO means Treaty.
> _(The T is uppercase to match the acronym, and the word "Treaty" takes an initial capital letter because that's how [NATO](/home/n#NATO) is spelled out.)
> _The I in AIDS means immune.
> _(The I is uppercase to match the acronym, but the word "immune" is lowercase because that's how [AIDS](/home/a/aids) is spelled out.)_C represents Celsius.
> __He got a B on the test.
> __The jury asked to see Exhibit A again._
>
> _When she sang her ABCs, she always paused midway through and said, "P is for pony."_


**Clusters of capital letters do NOT need apostrophes when rendered in plural form** (e.g., _VIP_ and _FAQ_ become _VIPs_ and _FAQs_). The same applies to two or more figures constituting a plural (e.g., 1980s, the Dirty '30s). **But ADD apostrophes to INDIVIDUAL letters when forming plurals, whether lowercase or capitalized:**


> _She got three A's and two B's on her report card._
> _They want schools to focus more on the three R's — reading, writing and arithmetic._
> _A game of X's and O's.
> __The Oakland A's.
> __Mississauga is spelled with four s's._
>
> _Cross your t's and dot your i's._

**SIMPLIFIED STYLE:** In August 2023, we streamlined our approach to using apostrophes to signal the plural form of individual letters. Until then, the punctuation was added only to lowercase individual letters (p's and q's). We decided it was simpler to match AP style and extend apostrophes to uppercase individual letters, too. This makes our typography more consistent. While the Canadian Oxford says Xs and X's are both acceptable plural forms of a capital X, for example, it specifically lists X's and O's as the colloquial name for tick-tack-toe. And while CP has traditionally recommended no apostrophe for most uppercase individual letters, it does encourage the punctuation in cases when there could be confusion (e.g., when "A's" or "I's" might look like the words "As" or "Is" without the punctuation). By adopting Associated Press style, CBC News journalists no longer have to decide whether the plural form of a single letter takes punctuation. We simply add an apostrophe, regardless of whether the individual letter is lowercase or capitalized.


See also [apostrophes](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes/ "Apostrophes") for handling single letters turned into verbs (X'd, X'ing)


See also [How to handle periods below](/home/a/abbreviations#periodssingleletters) (The T in NATO but Mr. T.)


**Logic often dictates size of single letters ("w" vs. W)**
**Occasionally, either form is OK. Pick the version that is easiest for our audience** to follow:


> _They removed all the w's from the office's keyboards._
>
> _They removed all the W's from the office's keyboards._

**
Here, the first version is more common because it's a generic reference to the alphabet**, even though keyboards typically feature capital letters. But either is acceptable.

The Canadian Press points out: "Whether to write a single letter as a capital or lowercase in a particular context depends somewhat on personal taste." But **logic should be applied**. For instance:


> _There was a T scratched on the door._
>
> (This implies a capital T appeared.)
>
> _There was a "t" scratched on the door._
>
> (This implies a lowercase "t" appeared.)
>
> _It begins with a capital S._
>
> _She always slipped a small letter "x" somewhere in her drawing._
>
> _Good spellers remember to add a second "m" in accommodate._


**The subtleties of such logic can be illustrated by the choice of something as rudimentary as a verb,** such as is instead of _becomes_ below:


> _When MP is spelled out, the "m" is lowercase (i.e., member of Parliament)._
>
> _When MP is spelled out, the M becomes lowercase (i.e., member of Parliament)._

**How to handle periods after single letters (Madame X but Mr. D.)**
**Generally add periods to letters on their own only if they're "true" abbreviations** (i.e., letters that could conventionally stand alone, such as a person's middle initial, rather than merely one letter plucked from an acronym, such as the S in NASA, or letters that are not conventionally written without punctuation, such as metric symbols):


> _"My name is Madame X," she said._
>
> (No period. Madame X is treated as a proper noun, not as an abbreviation.)
>
> _Let's assume A sues B for copyright infringement._
>
> (No periods. The alphabetical designations are generic.)
>
> _F means Fahrenheit._
>
> (No period. Here, the F is considered a symbol rather than an abbreviation.)
>
> _Will a compass needle still hover over the N at the South Pole?_
>
> (No period. Here N is a compass mark rather than an abbreviation for north. A needle doesn't hover over the "north." It points north.)
>
> _John F. Kennedy's middle name was Fitzgerald._
>
> _He's referred to as Mr. D. throughout the documents._
>
> (The D has a period because it's an abbreviation for Mr. Dimple.)
>
> _They found the answer on p. 4._
>
> (Normally, "p. 4" is written out as page 4, but p. is acceptable in graphics, tabulations, etc., where space is at a premium, especially if the spelled-out word would otherwise appear more than once.)

Kennedy_ vs. _JFK_), and the [hyphens overview](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#A-list) for punctuation in various compounds involving letters of the alphabet (_Exhibit A_ and _B Block_ but _A-list_ and _B-team_)


**Foreign language lettering**
**If an abbreviation based on another language is better known than its English equivalent, generally use the more familiar letters** (e.g., _CERN_ rather than _EONR_). But **instead of spelling out the foreign wording** (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire), **prefer background context in English** (e.g., _"He worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known by the French acronym CERN"_).

In such cases, **do not automatically make the foreign abbreviation all uppercase. Follow established convention** (e.g., _"The report looked into a unit of Iran's Defence Ministry called the "Research Center for Explosion and Impact," better known by its Farsi language abbreviation Metfaz"_).


**When and how to spell out**
**Abbreviations that are well-known can be used without being spelled out** (_CBC, MP, RCMP_, etc.). **The list grows over time.** When _NASA_ was first set up in the 1958, it was frequently identified as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Now, however, the U.S. space agency is a household acronym. The same goes for _LED_, which no longer needs to be defined as "light-emitting diode."

**Abbreviations are normally written out in lowercase** (GST becomes the goods and services tax, GIS becomes the _guaranteed income supplement_, and RRIF becomes the registered retirement income fund) **unless they are proper nouns** (CSIS becomes the _Canadian Security Intelligence Service_) **or include proper noun elements** (MP turns into _member of Parliament,_ with only one word capitalized). A few exceptions have become entrenched, normally based on treating the root term as a formal name (e.g., CPP is spelled out as the **Canada Pension Plan**, and OAS is spelled out as the _Old Age Security_ program).

**Do not assume that all capital letters in abbreviations are retained** in the long form (e.g., _NWT_ stands for the _Northwest Territories_, not the North West Territories, while _TV_ is short for _television_). **And remember that words not represented in the short form may need to be added when spelled out**, especially prepositions (e.g., PoW includes the "o" for "of" in _prisoner of war_ while BA doesn't, even though the latter is spelled out as a _bachelor of arts_ degree).

M**ake sure all spelled-out forms are correct** (ABM stands for "_automated_" not "_automatic_" _banking machine_.)

**Always spell out less-common terms** early on in a story ("_bovine spongiform encephalopathy_" for _BSE_). The longer version does not have to be at the beginning if it makes the lead too unwieldy.

**Avoid spelling out popular abbreviations when the longer form is not in general use** (_DNA_, not _deoxyribonucleic acid_, and _CAT scan_, not _computerized axial tomography scan_).

**While certain terms, such as _BASE jumping_, are never spelled out, they're normally explained in stories if considered obscure** (e.g., _"Parachute jumping from a fixed point, such as a high building, rather than from an aircraft"_). **Explanations do not have to be lengthy, and do not have to include actual definitions of each letter** (in this case, for instance, BASE stands for "building, antenna, span, earth"), since that's rarely practical.

**Generally avoid colloquial shorthand** (_ID'd_ for _identified_) in news stories, **except in headlines and transcribed quotes**. Features may be an exception, as long as the lighter tone of such shorthand (_KO'd, OK'd, PO'd_) suits the piece.

**It's unnecessary to put an organization's well-known abbreviation in parentheses immediately after the longer form is used.** Instead, the shorter version can appear on its own later (_CNIB_ in a story about the Canadian National Institute for the Blind).

**When the shortened form of the noun is not widely known, however, a brief reminder is generally required in second reference** (e.g., _CALPA, the pilots association, took the case to court_). **For this reason, it's often best to avoid such abbreviations in stories** and use a general label instead (e.g., the association, the union, the pilots). See the next section for more details.

**If publishing obscure abbreviations, be certain to confirm which letters to use and whether they're all capitalized.** For example, _CPHA_ stands for the _Canadian Public Health Association_ while _CPhA_ refers to the Canadian Pharmacists Association. Note: To review why it's "_pharmacists association_" instead of "_pharmacists' association_" and "_pilots association_" instead of "_pilots' association_" see [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe).


**When to avoid abbreviations**
Keep in mind that **regional expressions are not familiar to everyone across the country**. If you're writing a story for a local audience, for instance, _MLA_ on its own is OK if it's commonly used in the region. But if you're writing a story for a national audience, "_member of the legislative assembly_" or "_member of the legislature_" would be better. This also applies to _MHA_ in Newfoundland and Labrador ("_member of the House of Assembly_"), _MNA_ in Quebec ("_member of the National Assembly_") and _MPP_ in Ontario ("_member of the Provincial Parliament_"). The same is true for [airport codes](/home/a/airport) (e.g., YVR, YYZ, YUL).

Text looks odd and becomes harder to read when sprinkled too liberally with blocks of capital letters. **Generally avoid abbreviations that seem foreign or forced** (_CA_ for _Canadian Alliance, WMD_ for _weapons of mass destruction_, _HRC_ for _Human Rights Commission_, and _PPP_ or _P3_ for _public-private partnerships_). **Instead, choose generic terms** for subsequent references (_the party, the weapons, the commission,the partnerships,_ etc.). **In general, this approach also applies to abbreviations that border on being obscure** (e.g., CALPA, CPHA), as noted in the previous section on spelling out abbreviations.

Even widely embraced terms such as NATO can very quickly become "typographically intrusive," as the New York Times Manual of Style and Usage puts it. **Instead of bombarding readers with capital letters, type a synonym** (such as "_the Atlantic alliance_" or "_the alliance_") every so often.

**Broadcast journalism is generally more difficult for the ear to follow when it includes too many abbreviations**, especially if they're obscure (e.g., [PKK, YPG, PYD](/home/p#PKK)). For this reason, accurate, generic wording is often clearer in second reference (e.g., "Kurdish-led fighters in Syria" rather than "YPG").


**Miscellaneous caveats**
**Always check the Language Guide for CBC News preferences**, rather than blindly following the abbreviations used by external sources.

**Be careful not to repeat part of a term by mistake** (make it the _NDP_ not the _NDP party_, since the latter stands for "_the New Democratic Party party_"). Similar traps to avoid include: _OPEC countries, RCMP police officer, PIN number, ATM machine,_ and _HIV virus._

**Generally avoid tabloid abbreviations that stand out as overly informal** ("_nukes_" for _nuclear weapons_ and _"pen" for penitentiary_). **And keep in mind that a few abbreviations we permit in headlines** (e.g., _StatsCan_) **are generally spelled out in the rest of the story** (_Statistics Canada_). **Sometimes colloquialisms become entrenched.** The terms _webcam_ and _dashcam_ (for dashboard camera) are examples. **But in such cases, the clipped form almost always becomes part of the fused compound rather than appearing as a noun on its own** (i.e., as "_cam_"). See [camera](/home/c#camera) for other examples (e.g., write security camera rather than "security cam").

**Be consistent when using abbreviations**. For example, if writing _WW II_ in a headline always use _World War II_ and _WW II_ in the main text as well, even though our normal preference would be _Second World War_ (i.e., in stories without [WW II](/home/w#WW1WW2) in the headline).

**Reserve the honorific [_Dr._](/home/d/dr) for health-care professionals.** It's spelled out as doctor unless used in front of a name. **For people with _PhDs_ other than licensed psychologists, use descriptive titles.** (_UBC political science professor Jane Gerrymander_, for instance, or _Mark Newton, who teaches physics at the University of New Brunswick_.) **Common terms** (BA or PhD) **are fine, but do not use obscure abbreviations for academic credentials. When spelled out, university degrees are always in lowercase** (_MA_ but _master of arts_).

**Although it's common to put an article (the) in front of many abbreviations that represent organizations** (the UN or the RCMP), **we often drop this convention with well-known [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms)** (NATO, NASA, OPEC, UNICEF, WHO).

**The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's internet service is _CBC.ca_ in all news stories.** Do not use the lowercase version that appears in some promotional material (_cbc.ca_). This applies to other titles altered in graphical branding, such as "cbcnews.ca" and "cbc news" (which should be _CBCNews.ca_ and _CBC News_ in our journalism). See [CBC](/home/c/cbc)

**Follow unorthodox capitalization of abbreviations only if it's the preference of a well-known figure** (_k.d. lang, e.e. cummings_). See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

### abortion

**Abortion**

**Language used in stories about abortion should be as neutral as possible.** Write "fetus" instead of "unborn child," for instance.

**It's best to describe people's specific positions rather than merely label them as being pro- or anti- something** (e.g., _"Anderson wants to limit abortions to cases involving minors who've been sexually assaulted"_).

**But in headlines and certain sentence constructions, shorthand is the only practical solution. In these cases, use the following terms:**

-   **anti-abortion** (not "pro-life")
-   **pro-choice** or **pro-abortion rights** (but not "pro-abortion")

**The only exceptions are when we're referring to a specific proper noun, such as an organization** that calls itself the Pro-Life Federation of North America. But in news stories, we would still describe members of such a group as being "anti-abortion."

Whenever possible, **prefer specific information about the timing of an abortion** (e.g., the 18th week of a pregnancy versus, say, the 22nd week) **over general labels, such as "late term."** The latter is a vague description with no precise legal or medical definition. It conventionally means "late" into the second trimester (i.e., after the 21st to 24th week), and is commonly linked to fetus viability outside the womb. **Be aware that some people wrongly assume that "late term" means virtually "full-term" pregnancy** (i.e., after the 36th week). Such imprecision can hinder fact-based public policy debates.


**Pro-life is too vague** because it doesn't specifically address the issue of pregnancy (raising questions about people's views on capital punishment, euthanasia, etc.). It also implies that everyone who is not "pro-life" is in the opposite camp (i.e., pro-death).

**Pro-abortion is not always accurate** (e.g., when describing a large crowd of protesters) because many people lobby for a woman's right to choose abortion while not favouring abortion as a personal option, themselves.


People who campaign to expand abortion services (e.g., setting up clinics) can accurately be called **abortion rights activists**, since this term accurately captures the sense of a woman's right to choose. **When naming individuals, it's important to note any known distinctions between personal and general views** (e.g., _"Lang says she would never have an abortion but still advocates other women's right to choose"_).


**Avoid using the terms "women's rights" and "abortion rights" interchangeably.**

**Women's rights broadly refers to equality between women and men**, including many basic legal rights (e.g., voting, working, attending school, owning property). Women's **reproductive rights fall under the umbrella of women's rights** — covering everything from access to birth control and abortion services to freedom from coerced sterilization and other non-consensual medical procedures.

**Abortion rights is common, acceptable shorthand for "women's right to abortion services."** Expressions such as **the right to choose** are also OK, as long as the context of abortion is already clear.

Be aware that **not all people championing women's rights support access to abortion services.** The label "anti-abortion feminism," for example, is sometimes used to describe groups like Pro Woman, Pro Life. Members of such groups fundamentally disagree with pro-choice feminists, who are represented by organizations like the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. In other words, **the term women's rights is complicated and does not have the same meaning to all women, especially when abortion is debated.** The history and politics of these competing views of "women's rights" and "abortion rights" are explored in detail in the 2015 book, _The Changing Voice of the Anti-Abortion Movement: The Rise of 'Pro-Woman' Rhetoric in Canada and the United States_, by University of Ottawa academics Paul Saurette and Kelly Gordon.

### accidents

**Accidents, collisions, crashes, etc.**

**Picking a verb**

**When covering stories, it's important to use accurate and neutral language.

In the case of most motor vehicle collisions, for instance, we should be cautious about stating that person A "hit" person B**, unless the information is attributed (e.g., to police) or is not in dispute (e.g., video clearly shows A hitting B). **For this reason, a verb such as "collide" is often a better choice** than "hit" (e.g., the truck and car collided).

**The verb "[door](/home/d#dooring)"** has become a convenient and **increasingly common way to refer to collisions between cyclists and open doors of stopped vehicles** (e.g., "She's in critical condition after being doored riding to work"). Again, **be careful with how stories are worded**. Motorists and their passengers are supposed to check to make sure it's safe before opening their doors in most jurisdictions. So while it might be technically accurate to state that a "cyclist rode into a door," such **phrasing can imply it was the cyclist's fault.** One option is to stick with neutral wording (e.g., "the cyclist collided with the door"). But **when known facts fit, it's often OK to use a verb like "hit" or "stuck" in a dooring accident** (e.g., "the cyclist was hit by a suddenly opened door"), **as long as the details are attributed** to authorities, witnesses, etc., **or are not in dispute** (e.g., verified video shows what happened). It's akin to describing someone being "hit by" debris tossed from an overpass, instead of saying that they "collided with" falling debris. **Use common sense.** Be aware that such accidents can be fatal, and do not always involve the driver's door (e.g., passengers in a taxi may be exiting the vehicle without checking to see if there's any oncoming traffic). Also be aware that while some people strongly oppose the word "accident" to describe dooring, the noun is common and generally OK for reasons outlined below.


**Picking a noun**
**The same principles about accuracy and neutrality outlined above apply. But there's no need to get carried away with adopting awkward constructions solely to avoid use of a word such as "accident"** in our coverage.

**It's a myth that the term "accident" automatically implies something "accidental"** rather than "intentional." **The word has another entrenched meaning: unexpected.** This isn't a recent development. From its original Latin roots, "accident" has referred to an unplanned "befalling" or "happening" — which gradually expanded to mean simply a "mishap."

**In this context, "accident" has become a widely used synonym for collision.** The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, for instance, lists one definition of accident as: _"an automobile collision or crash."_  **This does not imply that a given accident won't be blamed on one or more people, equipment failure, the weather, etc.** Indeed, police may well lay charges. **It simply means that "accident" and "collision" are entrenched synonyms in English.** Investigators fill out "accident reports." Insurance companies offer "no-fault accident" coverage.

**Since "accident" is a perfectly acceptable way to describe an unexpected event,** therefore,  **industrial accidents** do NOT need to be referred to as, say, "industrial incidents," and **traffic accidents** do NOT automatically need to be referred to as, say, "collisions." **At the same time, it's important to be as precise as possible. So when covering a given story, it's best to pick a different word if you consider "accident" inappropriate or misleading** (e.g., when negligence has been proven, or if there's compelling evidence that a particular tragedy was intentional). **Use your own judgment.**

### acronyms

**Acronyms**

**Acronyms are abbreviations that can be pronounced.

When formed from the first letter of each word in a compound noun, they're almost always written in uppercase and without periods:**

> **BAFTA** (British Academy of Film and Television Arts)
>
> **CSIS** (Canadian Security Intelligence Service)
>
> **NAFTA** (North American Free Trade Agreement)
>
> **NATO** (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
>
> **UNESCO** (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)


This normally applies even when an element previously treated as two works or as hyphenated words is now fused (e.g., "interbank"):

> **LIBOR** (London interbank offered rate)


Acronyms are not always "pure" initialisms. They can also be made up of clipped words represented by a cluster of consonants and/or vowels, such as "NOR" for "North." These may or may not be all uppercase, depending on established convention and in-house style


> **[Nabisco](/home/q/quirky-capitalization)** (Originally stood for the "National Biscuit Company")
>
> **[NORAD](/home/n#NORAD)** (North American Aerospace Defence Command)


Be aware that a few news organizations limit the number of uppercase letters (e.g., UNESCO becomes "Unesco" at the New York Times because the acronym has more than four characters). But we write UNESCO for various reasons, including convention, simplicity and ease-of-scanning.

**A common exception to the uppercase rule is when the abbreviation is thought of more as a name on its own than as shorthand** (e.g., the musical group **_Abba_**, which is technically formed out of letters representing the musicians' names). See [Quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for related guidelines.

**If you spell out acronyms**, follow the same guidelines governing other abbreviations. **Words should be in lowercase unless they're normally capitalized** (for example, if they're part of the official name of an organization).


> **[AIDS](/home/a/aids)** (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)
>
> **RAM** (random access memory)
>
> **SALT** (strategic arms limitation talks)
>
> **[SARS](/home/s/sars)** (severe acute respiratory syndrome)
>
> **WHO** (World Health Organization)


**Always make sure the longer form still applies. UNICEF** is well enough known to be used on first reference. But if spelled out it should be identified by its new name (**United Nations Children's Fund**) not by its old one (UN International Children's Emergency Fund).

In some cases, letters are added or dropped in the abbreviation — such as one of the Cs in **_ACTRA_**, which actually stands for the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists. When uncertain, always check the noun before spelling it out.

**Many acronyms that are part of everyday language are no longer capitalized. The dictionary is a good guide** in these cases. (For instance, **laser** is short for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation," **radar** stands for "radio detection and ranging," and **scuba** represents "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.")

**Although it's common to put an article (the) in front of many abbreviations** that represent organizations (_the UN_ or _the RCMP_), **we often drop this convention with well-known acronyms.** We do not say or write "the **NASA**" or "the **OPEC**" or "the NATO" or "the UNICEF." In stories about the World Health Organization, therefore, it's usually not necessary to type "the [**WHO**](/home/u/united-nations#WHO)," unless doing so makes a sentence clearer (e.g., underscores that WHO is an abbreviation rather than the pronoun "who" in a broadcast script).

For more on clipped forms in general, including pitfalls to avoid, see [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations).

### act

**Act (legislation)**

**Capitalize the specific name of legislation** (often referred to in law as a statute's official "short title"):

> the British North America Act
>
> the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act
>
> the Income Tax Act
>
> the Privacy Act
>
> the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act
>
> the Youth Criminal Justice Act

**Use regular type** rather than [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**The above applies whether the legislation is merely proposed** (i.e., a bill) **or actually passed and proclaimed as law.** For instance, the **Price Transparency Act** was a bill tabled by the federal government in 2014 that outlined various amendments to the **Competition Act**.

When citing official titles, watch for hyphenated compounds that may have only one capital letter (e.g., Canada's 2001 **Anti-terrorism Act** and the 1997 **Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act**).

**Generally use lowercase wording for generic descriptions or references** to laws (e.g., _the act to protect endangered species_ versus the **Species at Risk Act**), as well as **plural constructions** (e.g., _various human rights acts across the country_) **and generic second references** (e.g., _critics of the act held a demonstration on Parliament Hill_). **However, lean toward capitalized names of what are arguably generic descriptions if the wording is, essentially, an abridged version of the formal title** (e.g., the **Alberta Sovereignty Act** when referring to the 2022 **Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act**), even in second reference (**the Sovereignty Act**). The primary test should be whether a different generic summary could be chosen that doesn't lift verbatim wording from the formal title. Since some people might easily think of a "sovereignty act" involving formal secession, while others might dispute the term "sovereignty" accurately encapsulating the legislation's intent, it's important to flag the description as the government's. Another example is Ontario's 2022 **Strong Mayors, Building Homes Act**, which could be neutrally described as an act to give mayors special powers or expanded powers. The provincial government's choice of the word "strong" in this case arguably conveys an element of PR spin and, so, might become editorially problematic if left lowercase.


**Official titles optional; clarity is key**
CBC News began capitalizing the titles of proposed legislation in late 2014 to help make our journalism clearer. Some news organizations, including Canadian Press, recommend keeping the names lowercase until the bills actually become law. But this can lead to undesirable confusion, especially when a bill's title includes wording that isn't neutral (e.g., Bill C-42 was called the **Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act**).

TIP: **It's sometimes better to use general, lowercase descriptions of legislation rather than formal titles**, especially when the latter are rambling, ambiguous, etc. **Options include putting quotations marks around certain text** (e.g., _what the government has dubbed its "common sense" firearms bill_) to using words that highlight the legislation's goals (e.g., referring to the **Price Transparency Act** as, say, the _Competition Bureau bill_, since the federal government said it was trying to give the Competition Bureau more powers to investigate certain cross-border price gaps between Canada and the U.S.).


**Bill C-42, the bill**
**Always capitalize the first letter of generic nouns** (e.g., act, article, bill) **that are followed by figures denoting a place in a numbered series** (Act 1, Article 22, Bill C-33), whether the legislation is merely proposed or actually passed.

> **Bill C-68** (numbered series) is considered the strictest **gun control legislation** (general reference) in Canadian history. When passed in 1995, it created the **Firearms Act** (name of proclaimed legislation).

### acting versus interim

**Acting versus interim**

There's a subtle but useful distinction worth preserving:

The word **acting generally implies something sudden and very temporary**. For example, if a committee's chair is ill or away and someone fills in, this person becomes the acting chair. Acting titles are normally kept lowercase (e.g., _acting Edmonton police chief Dave Korol_).

The word **interim generally refers to a comparatively longer appointment**, usually specified. For example, a political party picks an interim leader for six months, until a convention is held to choose someone permanent. Interim titles follow the same capitalization style of permanent titles (e.g., _interim Premier Dave Hancock, interim Liberal Leader Bill Graham_).

Generally prefer the official title used by the person (e.g., when federal Auditor General Sheila Fraser retired at the end of May 2011, her former deputy became _interim Auditor General John Wiersema_, according to the prime minister's news release and the AG's website).

After being used once in a given story (normally in first reference), it's often unnecessary to repeat the qualifier "acting" or "interim."

**In rare cases, a title like "acting" or "interim" can be controversial** (e.g., if there's political unrest in a country, and someone claims to be the acting or interim leader pending a new election). **To keep stories accurate and impartial, always make it clear when someone has given themselves a title that's disputed by others in power** (e.g., a country with duelling presidential claims). **This often means adding a modifier like "self-declared" in first reference in the body of a story, as well as in headlines and TV supers:**


> _Venezuela's self-declared interim President Juan Guaido_


After that, a qualifying modifier like "self-declared" can usually be dropped.

NOTE: **Capitalization conventions are different in television, which means "interim" would commonly be spelled with an uppercase "I"** when part of a title **in a TV super:**


> _Self-Declared Interim President Juan Guaido_ — (TV super)


(See **[TV text](/home/t/tv_text)** for details, as well as **[titles](/home/t/titles)** for related guidelines.)

Generally **avoid adding quotation marks to "acting" or "interim" in titles**, which can be easily misread as "[so-called](/home/s/so-called)" rather than self-declared.


### active voice

**Active versus passive voice**

**It’s a myth that the active voice** (subject-verb-object) **is always better than the passive.** True, it’s often more direct and energetic. But sometimes it’s not as practical or as effective.


**ACTIVE (preferred)**

> **active:** _Nasser read the book._
>
>     subject (Nasser) – verb (read) – object (the book)

> **passive:** _The book was read by Nasser._


**In the above case, the active voice is clearly preferred.** It has fewer words and more punch.


**PASSIVE (preferred)**

> **passive:** _Wednesday’s 6/49 numbers will be drawn 30 minutes late._
>
> **active:** _Lottery officials will draw Wednesday’s 6/49 numbers 30 minutes late._


**Here, the passive voice is preferred.** The sentence emphasizes what matters (6/49 numbers) rather than the people who will be drawing them. In fact, the lottery officials are not even mentioned in the passive construction because their involvement is sufficiently implied.


**ACTIVE often best**
**In a lot of journalism, the active voice is frequently better:**


> _She smashed the pumpkin._ (**Active; often preferred**)
>
> _The pumpkin was smashed by her._ (Passive)
>
> _He stole the money._ (Active; often preferred)
>
> _The money was stolen by him._ (Passive)


**But there are exceptions.** Bill Walsh of the Washington Post uses the passive voice to debunk the myth that the active construction is always superior:

_The active voice is overrated._ (Brief, clear and **passive**)
_People overrate the active voice._ (Active, but buries the key words)


**PASSIVE has strengths**
**Don’t hesitate to embrace the passive voice for a good reason, such as:**

-   **When you want to place emphasis elsewhere.**

> > **Focus on baseball umpire**
>
> > _The umpire was jeered._ (**Passive**)
>
> > _The crowd jeered the umpire._ (Active)
>
> > **Focus on laid-off workers**
>
> > _Another 500 autoworkers will be laid off in January._ (**Passive**)
>
> > _The company will lay off another 500 autoworkers in January._ (Active)

-   **When the subject is unknown.**

> > _The documents were stolen._ (Passive)
>
> > _One or more people stole the documents._ (Active but without meaningful extra detail)

-   **When it’s better not to specify the subject because of legal or editorial concerns.**

> > _Critical mistakes were made._ (Passive)
>
> > _Anderson made critical mistakes._ (Active but potentially defamatory)

### addiction

**Addiction, drug addiction, substance use, etc.**

**Drug and alcohol addiction are considered TREATABLE DISEASES. Avoid framing them in other ways** (e.g., it's inaccurate to characterize drug addiction as a lack of will power or as a moral lapse). Addiction is influenced by a variety of factors, including people's biology and environment, according to experts.

**"Addiction" is a good way to describe compulsive drug and/or alcohol use** because it's neutral, common and clear. The term **"addiction" is sometimes used in wider or non-clinical ways** (e.g., "porn addiction," "shopping addiction"). While it's OK to describe these as potentially harmful compulsive behaviours, avoid calling them "diseases." Substance addiction, by contrast, is defined as a "complex brain disease" by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is used by psychiatrists in many countries around the world, including Canada and the U.S. "Gambling addiction" is separately defined by the DSM as a pathological disorder.



[Miscellaneous](/home/a/addiction#miscellaneous) ('overdose' is OK, but avoid 'former' addiction and 'getting clean')


**Avoid 'drug abuse' and 'drug abuser'**
**Prefer "use" over "abuse"** in the context of addiction (e.g., "habitual drug use" rather than "drug abuse") outside of occasional proper nouns (e.g., the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse). Compounds like **"drug abuse" and "substance abuse" are increasingly viewed as outmoded because they can stigmatize people who have an underlying medical condition**. Although the noun "abuse" is relatively common in English, the accompanying modifiers often refer to victims (e.g., child abuse, elder abuse, animal abuse). Such compounds, in turn, are associated with criminal and anti-social behaviour. **Do not label people, themselves, substance "abusers."** Instead, stick with language that's non-judgmental (e.g., opioid users, people with a drug addiction). And **do not confuse "misuse" and "abuse."** Substance **"misuse" conventionally means taking painkillers and other prescription drugs too often or in excessive dosages**. Misuse can contribute to addiction, but it's not a synonym for addiction.


**Emphasize people over disorders, behaviour**
**Prefer what's sometimes called "person-first" phrasing** whenever practical. This means emphasizing individuals over specific conditions, diseases, disorders, etc. (e.g., **favour "people with addiction" over "addicts"**). For details and related examples about person-first writing, see our [disabilities overview.](/home/d/disability-language#practicalapplication)

There's **usually no need to adopt clinical jargon verbatim** (e.g., "substance use disorder") outside of directly transcribed quotes. **Steer clear of roundabout expressions** (e.g., "a person who uses drugs problematically" is fuzzy and verbose).

**Be aware that some people object to agent nouns** (e.g., user, drinker, gambler) **and their equivalents on the grounds that they're stigmatizing**. Critics say such constructions unfairly define individuals' identities by specific activity tied to addiction, habitual substance use and various compulsive disorders. **Always take into account known preferences of those we're reporting on, but don't automatically adopt indirect or awkward phrasing** (e.g., "people with a heroin-use disorder" is a very roundabout way of saying "heroin users"). English is full of agent nouns and attributive nouns (a computer user, an end user, a username, a user manual) that are entirely neutral. Put another way, the negative part of a compound like "drug user" is the modifier "drug" rather than the noun "user."


**Addiction versus dependence**
The words **"addiction" and "dependence" are often used interchangeably** in general news reporting. **This can sometimes cause confusion**, since health-care professionals may define the words differently in specific contexts. It's a good idea to **clarify whenever appropriate**. For example, **"dependence" is often used more narrowly to describe measurable physical factors** (e.g., a body's tolerance to a given substance after repeated use, a body's anguished reaction to sudden withdrawal, such as shaking, sweating, nausea and diarrhea). So while gambling is referred to as a compulsive disorder, it doesn't have the same physical dependence associated with, say, alcohol or opioid use. And **while a baby may be born with a chemical dependency** based on the drug use of her mother, **reporting that the infant has a "drug addiction" would almost certainly not match the child's clinical diagnosis.**


**Miscellaneous ('overdose' OK, but avoid 'former' addiction, 'getting clean')**
**Avoid inaccurate modifiers like "former" that suggest cures** (e.g., "former addiction" or "former alcoholic"). Scientific research shows that addiction changes people's brains in ways that are difficult if not impossible to reverse. **Instead, use words like "recovering"** that emphasize treatment and abstinence (e.g., "recovering alcoholic").

**Be fair and respectful, but don't rush to adopt dense or bureaucratic wording that muddies or weakens a story**. It's **OK to use entrenched, conversational shorthand for drug names** ("meth" instead of methamphetamine), **but avoid descriptive slang that's pejorative** (e.g., crackheads, junkies, stoners). **This includes phrases like "getting clean,"** which wrongly link a disease (addiction) to hygiene, contamination, etc. Pick fact-based alternatives instead (e.g., "stop using" and "abstain").

The word **overdose** is a **common, clear and acceptable way to describe a dangerous or lethal amount of one or more drugs** (e.g., died of an overdose). Be aware that some people object to the term because they say it unfairly blames those with substance addiction (i.e., that individuals hurt themselves by miscalculating a safe dose ). For this reason, they recommend alternatives such as "drug toxicity" and "drug poisoning" — along the lines of "alcohol poisoning." However, there's no strong lexicographical evidence that the word "overdose" is considered deprecatory or vilifying. Furthermore, while "alcohol poisoning" is entrenched and widely understood (too much alcohol in one's body at one time), "drug poisoning" doesn't normally convey the same meaning. Instead, the latter is conventionally associated with tainted materials or with intentionally administered toxins (e.g., a chemical-laced drink). Overdose continues to be used widely and neutrally by medical authorities, governments, researchers and others in public policy debates over addiction, including by Health Canada in its updates about the country's "opioid overdose crisis."

### addresses

**Addresses**

Just because it’s on a street sign doesn’t mean it’s our style. Otherwise, we’d be constantly adjusting how we handle abbreviations, ordinal numbers, etc., depending on the preferences of individual municipalities.

**Capitalize terms like street, road, etc., when they're part of names or general locations, except in plural constructions:**

_Wellington Street
Portage Avenue
Sparks Street businesses
Albert and Broad streets
the Chatterley Apartments_

**Treat ordinal numbers of streets, roads, etc., as part of the official name.** Spell out "_first_" through "_ninth_," no matter what system is used on local signs.

_First Street (**not** 1st Street)
11th Street (**not** Eleventh Street)
110th Avenue
_**Points of the compass (north, east, etc.) generally become a single letter followed by a period** (_N., E., etc._), no matter what system is used on local signs. Quadrant combinations (_northeast_) are represented by two letters and two periods (_N.E._). The only exceptions are compass points that are part of the official name (i.e., which appear before nouns such as street, road or lane, such as _West Hastings_):

_Queen Street W.
110th Avenue S.E.
South Service Road_

**Almost always abbreviate generic terms like avenue, road, apartment, etc., when publishing addresses that include specific locations (numbers)** along the streets, in the buildings, etc. Do not add hyphens (_121A_ rather than _121-A_). Use commas, however, to set off suites, apartments, etc.

_Bloor Street
Bloor Street W.
273 Bloor St. W.
599B Yonge St.
764 First St.
5925 110th Ave. S.E.
4500 South Service Rd.
Apt. 305, Fitzgerald Terrace
The body was found in Apt. 708.
He was mugged a block from his apartment._

**But spell out full addresses in rare cases established by convention** (e.g., in the official residence of the prime minister):
_24 Sussex Drive
10 Downing Street
221B Baker Street_ (fictional address of Sherlock Holmes)

**If the city is not obvious from the context of the story, it can be added after a comma:**

_101 West Hastings St., Vancouver, ...
205 Wellington St. W., Toronto, ..._

See [cities, provinces and countries](/home/a/abbreviations#Provinces) for more details on treating secondary information about a geographical location as a subordinate fragment framed by a set of commas.

**Commas are not needed to indicate thousands in addresses** or other sets of figures used solely for identification, such as serial numbers:

_1582 Inukshuk Ave.
The search began on the 3400 block of Missinaba Street._

### adoption

**Adoption**

The fact that a person is adopted should be mentioned only when relevant. The same is true when we refer to adults who either adopt children or place children into an adoption program. Such details can be highly personal.

Generally **avoid the increasingly archaic expression "given up for adoption,"** unless quoting someone directly. Otherwise, **prefer neutral terms like "placed into adoption"** or **"put up for adoption."** While "given up" can convey emotional hardship and feelings of loss associated with adoption placement, the expression is now perceived as judgmental and offensive (i.e., to mean "giving up on a child") by segments of our audience.

**Be aware that some people are offended by various other language tied to adoption.** It's OK to **take into account specific preferences** of those we interview, **but avoid adopting language that is ambiguous, euphemistic or otherwise problematic.**

For instance, **generally prefer either "birth" or "biological"** when referring to the genetic parents of adopted children (e.g., **"birth mother**" and "**biological father**"). **Alternatives tend to be either less clear or less neutral** (e.g., "natural" can suggest the adopted parents are unnatural, "real" can suggest the adopted parents are artificial, and "first" can telegraph unintended qualitative judgment instead of simple chronology). A modifier like "birth," by contrast, is fact-based and instantly understood.

**In rare cases, "birth" and "biological" may not work as synonyms.** For example, a surrogate mother may give birth to a child (i.e., be the "birth mother") even though another woman's fertilized eggs are used. In those cases, prefer "**surrogate mother**" to make the details clearer.


### adviser

**Adviser versus advisor**

In English, "-er" and "-or" endings are both used to describe objects or people performing specific functions (e.g., barber, calculator, computer, translator). Generally, there is only one standard spelling. Sometimes, however, "-er" and "-or" endings are both used. **The words adviser and advisor are an example of two common, competing spellings.**

**For simplicity, we generally use adviser** in our journalism because it's entrenched. **This is also the style at most major Western news organizations**, including CP, AP, Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the New York Times and the BBC:

> a close **adviser**
>
> a campaign **adviser**
>
> a national security **adviser**

The **most common exception is in business reporting**, where **a distinction is now often made between regulated and unregulated individuals** offering financial/investment advice.

> a **financial** or investment **adviser** (_regulated title in Canada; carries specific fiduciary responsibilities_) 
>
> a **financial** or investment **advisor** (_unregulated title, conventionally used by sales or marketing staff, including brokers_) 

**
We should reflect this industry practice whenever the detail is relevant.** Since many in our audience will probably not know the difference between the financial sector's use of these spellings, **a parenthetical explanation may be required to keep a given story clear**.  Specifically: **In Canadian banking, "advisor" is considered an unregulated title that refers to an individual who does not have the same legal obligations that a regulated "adviser" has when offering investment advice to a client.** NOTE: Since spellings are challenging to convey in broadcast journalism outside of TV supers and graphics, modifiers such as "regulated" or "specially designated" before the term "adviser" can help make scripts written for the ear more meaningful. **

Capitalized proper nouns** should retain their original spellings (e.g., the **Financial Advisors Association of Canada**, the **Financial Planners and Financial Advisers Act**). 



**Otherwise, keep 'adviser' as the default**

A few general, related points about spelling to keep in mind: 

1\. The Oxford English dictionary says **adviser and advisor have both been used for centuries**, although "adviser" appears to be the older form. **Other examples of competing spellings: We use converter, convener and conveyor** (rather than "convertor," "convenor" and "conveyer"). The **Canadian Oxford Dictionary lists "adviser" as the primary spelling**, with "-or" classified as a variant, and **the companion Oxford Canadian Spelling Dictionary specifically states: "_Use adviser_."**

2\. **There's no overriding logic behind English spelling**. Some people insist that "advisory" must automatically spawn "advisor," but there are many examples of vowels being added or altered as words change forms — from educate and investigate (versus educator and investigator) to honorary (versus honouree) and voluntary (versus volunteer). Furthermore, since **an adviser's job is to advise**, the "-er' suffix is not the least bit jarring.

3\. **When words are spelled in more than one way, we normally pick one version and stick with it for consistency** (e.g., honour, jewelry, plow, and raccoon rather than "honor" or "jewellery" or "plough" or "racoon," even though the latter are listed as acceptable alternatives in various dictionaries). **The main exceptions are proper nouns** (e.g., the generic Canadian spelling "centre" becomes uppercase "Center" in U.S. names such as Rockefeller Center or Kennedy Center) **and homonyms** (e.g., the generic Canadian spellings "cheque" and "check" are distinct words that sound the same). See our **[spelling overview](/home/s/spelling)** for details and more examples.

4\. **Compounds such as "national security adviser" are treated as generic job descriptions** rather than as true proper nouns in our journalism — along the lines of [defence](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) secretaries instead of "defense" secretaries, even when we're reporting on Washington, and [anesthesiologists](/home/a/anesthesiologist-versus-anesthetist) instead of "anaesthesiologists," even when we're referring to doctors in countries that retain ligatured vowels ("ae") in their titles. That's why AP, the New York Times and others commonly refer to the U.S. national security "adviser" instead of "advisor," even though the White House prefers the "or" spelling in its news releases.

### affect versus effect

**Affect versus effect**

These two words are often mixed up. The correct meanings are:

**affect** (_verb_: **to influence**)

**effect** (_noun_: **a result**; _verb_: **to bring about**)

Sleep patterns **affect** (_influence_) concentration.
Poor concentration is one **effect** (_result_) of no sleep.
By concentrating, we can **effect** (_bring about_) change.
Sleeping drugs can produce side **effects** (_results_).
It's possible they will **affect** (_influence_) you in unexpected ways.
The movie’s sound **effects** (_results or impressions_) were good.

The word affect is also sometimes used as a verb to mean to pretend or to adopt pompous affectation:

He **affected** (_pretended_) indifference.
The snob had **affected** (_pompously contrived_) speech.

**If you’re not sure whether to write _affect_ or _effect_, try inserting the text from the brackets above (_influence, result_ or _bring about_). If you're still uncertain, do NOT guess. Find out, or choose a different word.**

### Award versus award

**African swine fever**

While we generally avoid using geographic descriptors in virus or disease names, in this case there is no equivalent alternative for now. 

African swine fever is both the scientific and colloquial name for the disease – the [Canadian Food Inspection Agency](https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/african-swine-fever/eng/1306983245302/1306983373952), [World Organization for Animal Health](https://www.woah.org/en/disease/african-swine-fever/), [United States Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/safety-health/african-swine-fever) and [Canadian Pork Council](https://www.cpc-ccp.com/african-swine-fever) all use African swine fever and present no synonyms. 

The names of diseases and viruses can evolve - for example, [mpox was previously known by another name](/updates/2022/2022-11-28/) and was changed to avoid continued stigmatization. So we will continue to monitor and update as appropriate.

Note that African swine fever, the disease, is caused by African swine fever virus.

### after versus after- **After versus after-**

**Do not use a hyphen after this prefix when creating most nouns:**

_aftereffect, aftermath, afterthought, afternoon, aftershave, aftertaste, etc._
**
Use a hyphen when forming compound modifiers:**

_after-dinner drink
_
See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens)

### agreement

**Agreement versus agreement**

**Capitalize the generic word "agreement" only if it's part of an official name:**

_North American Free Trade Agreement_ (NAFTA)

_General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade_ (GATT)

_Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement ([CUSMA](/home/c/cusma))
_
the free trade _agreement_

a U.S.-Mexico _agreement_ on border security


See general rules on [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

### AIDS

**AIDS**

All uppercase, no periods. Spelled out in lowercase: **acquired immune deficiency syndrome**. (See [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms) for more details on punctuation and capitalization of similar abbreviations.)

AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system. It was labelled a syndrome in the early 1980s before **HIV** (the **human immunodeficiency virus**) was identified. It can be accurately called a disease in second reference, instead of the more lofty "syndrome."

In stories, never imply that it's spread only by sexual contact or that only one group (e.g., gay people) is at risk. Those who have symptoms should be called "people with AIDS." Avoid expressions like "victims of" or people who "suffer from" AIDS.

Those who have HIV but who do not show any signs of illness can be accurately called "HIV-positive" or "carriers" of the disease (a term used by the medical community). "AIDS patients" are actively receiving treatment.

The HIV/AIDS drug **AZT** used to be called **azidothymidine**. It's now more commonly known as **zidovudine**, which is simply an arbitrary alteration of the original chemical name.

See also [SARS](/home/s/sars)

### aircraft is and aircraft are

**Aircraft is and aircraft are**

The word **aircraft is both plural and singular:** _“The aircraft ran into trouble over Manitoba” and “The Department of Defence wants to buy more aircraft.”_


The possessive form is fine when you’re referring to a single plane or model. (_“Investigators think that a crack in the aircraft’s left wing caused the crash.”_)

But since the only correct plural possessive is also **aircraft’s** (as in **children’s**), it’s better to avoid this construction by rewording the sentence. (For instance, “the **planes’** wiring” instead of “the aircraft’s wiring.”) See also: [plurals](/home/p/plurals) (an overview) and [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)

See also [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names)
See also [cockpit versus flight deck](/home/c/cockpit-versus-flight-deck)

### Aircraft names

**Aircraft names**

Use figures instead of spelled-out numbers for airplanes (**Dash 8**).

Normally add a hyphen when switching from letters to numbers (**B-52, DC-8**) but not after numbers (a **747B** or an **F-4 Phantom 2 fighter**). The exception is when the initial letters are merely a series or model designation that's part of the aircraft's name rather than a true abbreviation, such as the A in **Airbus A340** (no hyphen) or the CS in Bombardier's **CS300** (no hyphen).

In most cases, the type of aircraft is identified by an actual abbreviation or initialism (e.g., **B** for bomber, **DC** for "Douglas commercial" plane, **LF** for "Lockheed fighter"). These **letters are routinely capitalized, unless the letters themselves are not actually initials** (e.g., **Yak-42** instead of "YAK-42" because "**Yak**" is short for Yakovlev, a passenger jet built by the Soviet Union in the 1970s).

The word "series" is capitalized only when treated as a proper noun equivalent in aircraft names, such as in the Bombardier **C Series** jets. For more than a decade, the company referred to these planes as its "CSeries." We and many other news organizations, including CP, treated this designation as a name and, so, adopted the fused format. But Bombardier eventually switched to "C Series" (space, no hyphen). This became our style in the fall of 2017. There's [no need for a hyphen in the compound](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#A-list) because of the capital letters.

Examples of aircraft names:

**Airbus A320** (no hyphen; A is part of a series name, not an abbreviation)

**Boeing 747**

**Boeing 737 Max 8** (Since 'Max' is not a true initialism only the M is capitalized)

**B-52

C-5A

CF-18** (the Canadian version of the U.S. F-18 fighter jet)

**CS100** (no hyphen; CS is part of a series name, not an abbreviation)

**DC-8

L-1011

LF-117

MD-80

TU-144

****Generally avoid longer, official designations of aircraft sometimes preferred by the military**, especially when shortened versions have become entrenched. For instance, the C-17 transport plane and the CF-18 fighter jet are known within the Canadian Forces as the CC-177 and the CF-188.

Be sure to use the correct abbreviation. Some people wrongly write MIG-25 instead of **MiG-25**, for example. The _M_ and the _G_ stand for the designers (Mikoyan and Gurevich). But the "i" represents "and" in Russian, so it doesn't need to be capitalized.

Plurals of terms ending with numbers or capital letters are formed by adding an "s" (**DC-10s** and **747Bs**). Although some news organizations, including The Associated Press, prefer to add apostrophes after capital letters in these cases (_747B's_), CBC News, The Canadian Press and others reserve this punctuation for possessive constructions (the **747B's cockpit**). See also: [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) and [aircraft](/home/a/aircraft-is-and-aircraft-are) (plural and singular). For general guidelines, see [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations).

### Airline versus Air Line

**Airline versus Air Line**

**The generic** (lowercase) **term _airline_ is always one word.**

**The capitalized version is normally one word, but some companies and organizations use a divided form in their names**. Since these are proper nouns, we follow their preferences. For instance:

_American Airlines
Delta Air Lines
Continental Air Lines
the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association_ (not _Pilots'_) See [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)


See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

### airport

**Airport versus airport**

Treat _airport_, _airfield_, etc., as generic (lowercase) words unless they're part of a full, proper noun:


> **Calgary International Airport**
> the Calgary **airport**
> **Kandahar Airfield**
> the Kandahar **airport**
> **Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport**
> the Ottawa **airport
> ****Lester Pearson International Airport
> **the **Pearson International Airport
> **the Toronto international **airport
> ****Pearson** airport
> **Pearson
> **the **Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport
> ****Trudeau International Airport
> **the Montreal international **airport
> ****Trudeau** airport


If a name officially changes, accuracy demands that we abandon the old noun. But always keep our audience's best interests in mind. In 2009, for instance, the "Toronto City Centre Airport" officially became the **Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport**. Since the latter is long and not instantly recognized, however, it's OK to call it the **Toronto City Airport** (uppercase "A" because it's a clipped form of the new proper noun), the Toronto Island airport (lowercase "a" because it's a descriptive name) or **Toronto's downtown island airport**.

**YVR, YEG, YUL**
**Avoid three-letter airport codes** (e.g., YVR, YEG, YYZ, YUL) **unless they;re clearly defined** in a given story:


> YVR (Vancouver airport)
> YEG (Edmonton airport)
> YYZ (Pearson airport)
> YUL (Trudeau airport)


Exceptions are codes that are obvious because they're true initialisms (JFK).

The international Air Transport Association (IATA) assigns unique codes to hundreds of airports around the world. **This shorthand is sometimes plastered all over signs at a given site, making the letters well known to local residents and frequent flyers. But that does not mean they're familiar to most of our audience.** So when using such codes (e.g., LAX for Los Angeles), be sure the meaning is clear. **Spelling out once in brackets is the usually the simplest way to add the detail.**

See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) and [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for related guidelines.

### allege

**Allege, alleged, allegedly**

**Words such as “allege” and “alleged” and “allegedly” must be used with caution.** In general reporting, **the terms imply an allegation of wrongdoing or impropriety.** They’re not mere synonyms for assert, declare, state, etc.

Always **distinguish between generic references to crimes or other misconduct and specific, unproven references**. For instance, it's accurate to talk about **security concerns over foreign interference in Canadian elections**, just as it's accurate to refer to experts worrying that a given policy might lead to a rise in violent crime rather than to a rise in "alleged" violent crime. However, when narrowly focusing on identifiable groups or people, it's crucial to make clear what's been proven and what's merely alleged (e.g., "**China's alleged interference in Canada's last federal election**").


**NOTE:** The rest of this entry provides only general guidance based on Journalism and the Law workshops designed for CBC staff over the decades. If you have any legal questions, including doubts about the wording of a specific story, always consult a CBC lawyer before publishing or broadcasting.

## **CRIME AND COURT REPORTING**

**Words such as “alleged” can be a practical way to avoid presuming guilt when reporting on formal but unproven charges.**


> FINE: _The pedestrian died Tuesday night after he was hit by a vehicle **allegedly** driven by an impaired, off-duty police officer._
> ("Allegedly" OK here because the constable has already been charged with impaired driving causing death.)
>
> FINE: _She is **alleged** to have unlawfully injected Botox and other filler substances into clients for several years._
> ("Alleged" OK because the story attributes the accusation to medical authorities seeking a court injunction.)


**However**, words such as “alleged” are **not historically considered a special shield against defamation.** This means that **merely inserting** a qualifying term like **“alleged” into a sentence is NOT a guarantee a story is legally sound.**


> WRONG: _The former actor is an **alleged** alcoholic and wife beater._
> ("Alleged" is meaningless in this context. There's no case before the courts, and the libellous rumours are neither provable as true nor otherwise defensible.)
>
> FINE: _Police are investigating the former actor. He is **alleged** to have abused his ex-wife._
> ("Alleged" OK because authorities have confirmed they're conducting a specific criminal probe.)

## **CIVIL CASES**

**Use “alleged” for formal but unproven** — and even defamatory — **claims from official court documents.** But be sure to **keep lawsuit coverage fair and balanced.** For instance, it’s important to point out that all accusations being made by one side or the other (e.g., in a statement of claim) have not been proven.

### Americanisms

**Avoid inapt Americanisms**

We've been implored to "avoid Americanisms" since we began broadcasting in the 1930s. It's a recurring theme in audience feedback and internal memos. It's also overly simplistic. **Canadian English is a blend of British and American word choice, pronunciation and spelling.** This means that **many so-called "Americanisms" are, in fact, "North Americanisms" — used widely and without complaint in Canada.**

CBC News style, therefore, is narrower: **Avoid inapt Americanisms** — i.e., language common in the United States but that's either inappropriate or generally not recommended in Canadian journalism for various reasons. **Deciding what's unsuitable is sometimes subjective. Furthermore,** since English is organic, **various boundary lines can shift** (e.g., automated tellers are now referred to as both [ABMs and ATMs](/home/a#ABM), even though the latter was initially considered "American" rather than Canadian).

This entry outlines **four areas requiring care:**

[1\. Missing detail](/home/a/americanisms#US) (e.g., add 'U.S.' for accuracy, clarity)
[2\. Spelling](/home/a/americanisms#spelling) (e.g., -our, -re, -lling)
[3\. Pronunciation](/home/a/americanisms#pronunciation) (e.g., Z = ZED not ZEE, except in 'DMZ')
[4\. Word choice](/home/a/americanisms#diction) (e.g., appeal court not appeals court, half-mast, not half-staff, impaired driving not DUI)

**1\. Missing detail** (e.g., add 'U.S.' for accuracy, clarity)
Some "Americanisms" are rooted in geographical perspective, cultural identity, etc., which influence certain turns of phrase. **Since a lot of wire copy comes from the United States, we need to be vigilant to keep our writing, and perspective, Canadian.**

This challenge has been with us from the beginning. In 1946, for instance, the head of CBC News sent an internal memo reminding staff to avoid calling Washington "the nation's capital":


> _"Ottawa is 'the nation's capital' as far as this country is concerned, not Washington.
> To hear Washington referred to in this way in a CBC News bulletin is extremely irritating
> to most listeners and quite properly so."_

> > — Dan McArthur, Chief Editor, CBC News, March 6, 1946


Subtler variations of this problem persist. **We're inundated by so many American proper nouns** (e.g., names of government agencies, titles of politicians) **we must guard against mischaracterizing something or someone as Canadian.** This includes implication by omission. For example, it's important to identify elected officials in Washington as foreign. **Adding U.S. to a title or name in first reference is often sufficient**:


> U.S. President Donald Trump
> U.S. Department of Commerce


**Words like "federal" and "national" are especially troublesome** because they can lead to Canadian proper nouns with similar names being corrupted (e.g., calling the **Transportation Safety Board of Canada** the "national" Transportation Safety Board, which sounds virtually identical to the **U.S. National Transportation Safety Board** in a broadcast script).

For details and related guidelines, see [United States, U.S., US](/home/u/united-states)


**2\. Spelling** (e.g., -our, -re, -lling)
**We get letters of complaint about letters of the alphabet** — from polite to snarky, from justified to unfounded. For example:


> "If _the first 'C' in CBC stands for 'Canadian,' you should not use explicitly American spellings.
> 'Hemorrhagic' is American, 'haemorrhagic' is English_."

> > — Don M., Calgary, Aug. 11, 2014


**"Hemorrhagic," however, is the preferred Canadian spelling**, according to the Oxford Canadian Spelling Dictionary, the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, the Guide to Canadian English Usage and other authorities. Indeed, as we explained in our response to the above email, **replacing many old ligatures ("ae" and "oe") with single vowels is a common feature of North American spelling** — e.g., eon, diarrhea, fetus, medieval and estrogen versus "aeon," "diarrhoea," "foetus," "mediaeval" and "oestrogen." **Notable exceptions outlined in our lingering ligature overview include:**


> **amoeba** (not "ameba")
>
> **archaeology** (not "archeology")
>
> **caesarian** (not "cesarean")
>
> **manoeuvre** (not "maneuver")


Hemorrhage is a bloody good example of how Canadian and British orthography sometimes diverge. We prefer **airplane, aluminum, curb, civilization** and **tire** (over aeroplane, aluminium, kerb, civilisation and tyre). But that certainly doesn't make us American. We also tend to go with **centre, colour, defence, labour, labelling** and **travelling** (over center, color, defense, labor, labeling and traveling). When two or more spellings are fairly widespread, CBC News declares a preference to maintain the professional sheen of consistency (e.g., **catalogue, program** and **raccoon** instead of catalog, programme and racoon).

McGill linguistics professor Charles Boberg sums up the realities — and challenges — of Canadian spelling this way:


> "_\[M\]ost linguists agree that **the main characteristic of Canadian spelling is the absence of any consistent
> pattern, with choices between American and British forms varying by word, context, publication,
> genre, region and social group**, thereby reflecting Canada’s transitional position between the two main
> standards of World English. It might be said that tolerance of disagreement about spelling is in any case
> a truer reflection of the modern Canadian character than a rigid adherence to British standards._
>
>
>
> "_As a result, however, **Canadian writers, editors and other language professionals face sometimes
> perplexing choices and uncertainties** that do not burden their British or American colleagues, at least
> not to the same extent_."

> > — [Canadian English](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fcanadian-english&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XLRwm39bBLElSLtzXMfAU) (2016 essay), Canadian Encyclopedia (online version)


**CBC News navigates this quagmire by following a few rudimentary principles, outlined in our [spelling overview](/home/s/spelling)** (e.g., "centre" unless a unique proper noun, like "Kennedy Center").

**One nagging style point** worth special mention: **Avoid adopting American spellings of government departments** ("Defense" and "Labor") **as well as various U.S. government titles** (Security "Advisor") **since such words are not traditionally treated as proper nouns.** Instead, **write U.S. Defence Department, Labour Day, U.S. National Security Adviser, etc.**, to avoid needlessly bouncing our audience from one set of spellings to another. Do such small tweaks amount to inaccuracy or disrespect? No. It's the same reason that the New York Times, Associated Press and others refer to, say, the "Defense Department" in Ottawa and to "Labor Day" in Canada. In a nutshell, U.S. media unapologetically steer clear of most Canadian spellings — including what amount to generic words like "defence" and "labour" in government nomenclature. See [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for details on relevant in-house style.


**3\. Pronunciation** (e.g., Z = ZED not ZEE, except in 'DMZ')
The most glaring phonological difference between Canadian and American English is probably how we say the last letter of the alphabet. Americans refer to Z as "ZEE," and find our choice of "ZED" peculiar. But as Wayne Grady points out in 1998 book, Chasing the Chinook: On the Trail of Canadian Words and Culture: **"ZED is not a Canadianism; ZEE is an Americanism,"** since ZED is also standard in England, Scotland, Wales, Australia and New Zealand. **Nevertheless, "ZEE" is not always out of bounds in our journalism.** In fact, it's actually recommended in a few cases. **For instance, the U.S.-coined abbreviation "DMZ"** (for "demilitarized zone") is known to English speakers around the world as "DEE-EM-ZEE."

North American pronunciations can vary substantially from region to region, often influenced by local or neighbouring dialects (e.g., Newfoundland English, southern U.S. English). On the whole, however, **there's far more overlap between Canadian and American pronunciations than there are differences**, according to linguists.

**Some English words have more than one acceptable pronunciation in Canada.** They defy efforts to impose a single, national preference. As the late CBC host and former broadcast language adviser, Russ German, once observed: "Usually, the argument boils down to the way we were taught by our parents or primary and elementary school teachers. People become emotionally attached to these pronunciations." Examples are:


> **aunt** (ANT or AWNT)
>
> **either** (EE-ther or EYE-ther)
>
> **schedule** (SKED-jool or SHED-yool)


**Other words, however, are marked by deeply ingrained Canadian pronunciations.** German cited several in an internal memo in 1992, along with the warning: "Please try to avoid the 'Americanization' of these words." **Examples** still relevant today **include three common prefixes:
**

> **anti-** (ANT-ee, not ANT-eye)
>
> **quasi-** (KWAW-see, not KWAWS-eye)
>
> **semi-** (SEM-ee, not SEM-eye)


A mnemonic for these three: "EYE before EE except in the case of C (i.e., Canada)."

Canadian English is alive, of course, which means we need to keep revisiting and revising certain guidelines as required. Among other things, **we've gradually expanded the number of words with more than one acceptable pronunciation** to better reflect modern usage. **Consult the [CBC Pronunciation Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XFPfiGVRPwO63-NkaNyUm) for specific recommendations.** It includes over 12,000 entries dating back several decades. **For background on the database**, including how preferences are determined, **see [Pronunciation FAQs](/handy-links/pronunciation)**.


**4\. Word choice** (e.g., appeal court not appeals court, half-mast not half-staff, impaired driving not DUI)
**Determining what's "Canadian English" is not always obvious.** For example, some people treat terms like "GST" and "chesterfield" as shibboleths. But the former is also used in New Zealand, where a goods and services tax was actually introduced five years before Canadian consumers started paying, and saying, GST. And while "chesterfield" for sofa is indisputably Canadian, it's also increasingly a relic — as unfamiliar to many young Canadians as, say, the outdated slang "pogy" for certain government payments, like employment insurance and welfare.

Dozens of words now in wide circulation around the world were born in Canada (e.g., **insulin, kerosene and snowmobile**). But the fact they caught on abroad makes them **more global English than Canadian.** Furthermore, several terms were originally adopted from various Indigenous languages (e.g., **chipmunk, kayak, toboggan**), adding to the Latin, Greek, French, Italian, German, Asian, Arabic and other **loan words that make up the simmering stew known as international English.**

**Judging what's an unsuitable "Americanism" in an English-speaking country's journalism can be relative and subjective** — relative, because it may vary depending on geography, and subjective, because it's influenced by everything from one's age to one's overall tolerance for variety in speech. **The BBC's 2018 Style Guide, for example, advises its staff to avoid a number of "Americanisms" that, to most Canadians, are perfectly acceptable** "North Americanisms," such as **downtown, shopping mall, trash can** and **morgue** (instead of town centre, shopping centre, dustbin and mortuary).

Furthermore, the same BBC entry about Americanisms includes the following bizarre claim: "We \[British people\] tend not to convert nouns into verbs." That statement is as inaccurate as it is sweeping. Virtually all linguists acknowledge that English is a highly flexible, adaptable language, including the notable convention of turning a lot of nouns into denominal verbs (e.g., to "butter" bread, "chair" a meeting, "coin" a phrase,' "lace" shoes, "milk" a cow, "petition" for change, "pocket" a different kind of change and "post" a letter). Such conversions fall under the broad category of anthimeria — a rhetorical device that's certainly not unique to North American English.

Numerous nouns, however, can be extremely jarring when they're used as verbs (to "gift" the good, to "rubbish" the bad), which is perhaps what the editors of the BBC Style Guide were driving at. They cite "to hospitalize," "to scapegoat" and "to debut" as undesirable Americanisms. Although it's perfectly acceptable to recommend writers and editors avoid certain unorthodox phrasing — including words that make scripts sound awkward and ugly, if not outright foreign — it's misleading to dismiss the general practice of turning nouns into verbs as either (i) wrong or (ii) a North American phenomenon.

**Most people who've lived in Canada even a few years know that there's a strong preference for North American vocabulary over British**. For example, we say **potato chips** instead of "crisps," call the front of a vehicle a **hood** rather than a "bonnet," and use **football** to mean a North American sport that's distinct from "soccer." ([Soccer](/home/s/soccer), for the record, is not an Americanism. It's actually a British word that fell out of favour in the U.K. last century.)

**We also tend to say apartment, diaper, elevator, sweater**, and **truck driver** rather than flat, nappy, lift, jumper and lorry driver. **At the same time, there's often more than one way to express the same point**, and most **Canadians are neither confused nor concerned when people refer to** bathrooms as **washrooms**, garbage disposals as **garburators**, parking garages as **parkades**, sneakers as **runners**, and hotel taverns as **beer parlours**.

Nevertheless, **national identity appears linked to certain expressions**, at least based on the passionate complaints we receive when alternative "Americanisms" are used in our on-air and online content. **Such language is considered "Canadian" in a special way.** Cherished. Protected. **Sometimes it's a matter of accuracy** (e.g., people are charged with "impaired driving" in Canada, not with "driving under the influence"). **But often it's comparatively arbitrary, reflecting deep fondness for the familiar** more than anything else.

For consistency, **CBC News generally recommends sticking with known Canadian preferences** when these are established, **unless there's strong evidence that a "competing" form has become equally common** (e.g., the American term [**AWOL**](/home/m/military-terms-overview#AWOL) has largely replaced the Canadian version, AWL). **For specific guidance, consult the Language Guide's A to Z listings.** Examples:


> [appeal court](/home/c/courts) **(NOT "appeals court"**) for provincial, territorial and federal appellate courts in Canada
>
> [basic military training](/home/m/military-terms-overview#miscellaneous) **(NOT "boot camp"**) for Canadian recruits
>
> [\-designate](/home/p/pm-designate) (**NOT "-elect"**), as in prime minister-designate, premier-designate
>
> [dismissed with disgrace](/home/m/military-terms-overview#miscellaneous) (**NOT "dishonourably discharged"**) for misconduct in the Canadian military
>
> [government](/home/a#administration) (**NOT "administration"**) for majority leadership in federal, provincial legislative bodies
>
> [guard of honour](/home/g/guard-of-honour) (**NOT "honour guard"**) at military ceremonies, funerals in Canada
>
> [half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) (**NOT half-staff**)
>
> [impaired driving](/home/i/impaired_driving) (**NOT DUI**)
>
> [inspect troops, inspect guard](/home/g/guard-of-honour) (**NOT review troops** or guard) in the Commonwealth
>
> _[Last Post](/home/l/last-post)_ (**NOT _Taps_**)
>
> [prisoner's box](/home/c/canadian-court-terms) (**NOT prisoner's dock**) in Canadian court rooms
>
> _[Rouse](/home/m/military-terms-overview#miscellaneous)_ (**NOT _Reveille_**) for morning bugle call in the Commonwealth
>
> [railway](/home/r/railway-versus-railroad) (**NOT railroad**)
>
> [U.S.](/home/u/united-states) (**NOT America**) in most references to country
>
> [witness box](/home/c/canadian-court-terms) (**NOT witness stand**) in Canadian court rooms


**Canadian English, like all English, is ever-changing.** Shifts in preferences are inevitable. As a result, **the CBC Language Guide is regularly updated to reflect current usage**, as well as to provide editorial recommendations tied to core journalistic principles, including accuracy, fairness and impartiality.

**FURTHER READING:** Anyone interested in Canadian words and phrases should check out the free online edition of the _[Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dchp.ca%2Fdchp2%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0i830EtdG6rmpYPh2dfWAl)_ (2017, Second Edition) — an updated version of the original work published during the country's centennial in 1967. _Canadian English: Origin and Structure_ (1975) and _The Languages of Canada_ (1979) by linguistics professor Jack Chambers remain classics. _Speaking Canadian English_ (1970) by Mark Orkin is an interesting, albeit much less scholarly, work worth a read. Canadian lexicographer Katherine Barber — former editor in chief of the Canadian Oxford Dictionary — has written extensively about Canadian English the past few decades, periodically contributing smart, entertaining essays to CBC television and radio broadcasts about everything from [food](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Farchives%2Fentry%2Fcanadian-food-whats-in-a-name&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2Nlb-afbUxD9VJraKyiuSy) to [hockey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Farchives%2Fentry%2Fthe-language-of-hockey&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3_DTBVvwmWt7m29aFUg9db).

### ampersand

**Ampersand ( & )**

**1\. Use this symbol for "and" when it’s part of an official name** (A&E, A&W). **But check first.** (For instance, the Globe **and** Mail, Wayne **and** Shuster, etc., do not have ampersands.)

**If & is part of the proper name and it falls between two words, leave a space on each side. If it’s between two letters, there is no space:**

> AT&T
>
> Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
>
> _Quirks & Quarks_ (use [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) because it's the name of a radio program)


**2\. If a company appears to be inconsistent in its use of an ampersand, generally prefer the symbol &** over the conjunction "and" **if it helps our audience identify the abbreviation as a proper noun:** 

> MM&A (for Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway)


**3\. An ampersand can also be used in second reference** (or headlines) **in some widely used abbreviations,** many listed in the Canadian Oxford:

> **B&B** (bed and breakfast)
>
> **Q&A** (question and answer)
>
> **R&B** (rhythm and blues)
>
> **R&D** (research and development)
>
> **R&R** (rest and relaxation)


Parenthetical definitions are **not** necessary unless an obscure term is used (e.g., in a transcribed broadcast clip): "She joined L&D \[Learning and Development\] in 2004." Use [square brackets](/handy-links/punctuation/brackets) when explanations are added to direct quotes. Otherwise, regular parentheses are OK.

Note: The Canadian Press began using ampersands in colloquial expressions (B&B, R&B, etc.) in the summer of 2003, several years after some other news outlets, including the Globe and Mail. Until then, CP had preferred the word "and" spelled out in these cases.

### anesthesiologist versus anesthetist

**Anesthesiologist versus anesthetist**

CBC News prefers **anesthesiologist**, although anesthetist is fine in a story if it's the person's known preference.

In the broadest sense the words are synonymous, but they can have different meanings depending on where you live. In some countries, for instance, an anesthetist (usually spelled _anaesthetist_ in Britain) must be a doctor. Elsewhere, however, an anesthetist can be anyone trained to administer anesthetics (e.g., a nurse).

**In Canada, anesthetists are doctors. In the 1990s, a majority of them voted to change the name of their national society and call themselves _anesthesiologists_** (originally a U.S. term for physicians who specializes in anesthesiology). They predicted the new label would clear up any confusion over their medical credentials by identifying them as doctors. The word anesthetist is not even listed as an option in the second edition of the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

**Having a general style preference** (anesthesiologist) **makes our journalism more consistent, but permitting anesthetist when it's a doctor's stated preference balances consistency with respect.** Just because the word anesthetist appears in one broadcast clip or transcribed clip (web quote), however, does not mean the term needs to be used throughout a story. Use your own judgment.

Avoid the extra "a" (_anaes-_) when spelling any of these words (**anesthesia**, **anesthetic**, **anesthesiologist**, etc.). This reflects entrenched Canadian usage in medical schools, hospitals, academic journals and professional organizations, such as the [**Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society**](https://www.cas.ca/en/home). See [lingering ligatures](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/spelling/lingering-ligatures/ "Lingering ligatures") for an overview of how we approach similar "ae" and "oe" words.

See [**Dr.**](/home/d/dr) for guidelines on using the honorific for health-care professionals only.

### animals

**Animals**

**In general, we keep the names of animals lowercase unless the words are derived from proper nouns.**

For instance, **dachshund** is lowercase (it comes from the German words for "badger dog"). But **Dalmatian** is capitalized because it refers to the ancient region of Dalmatia (which is now southwest Croatia), and **Doberman** is based on a breeder's name. Often proper noun elements are obvious (e.g., **Boston terrier** and **bracco Italiano**), but sometimes they require verification (e.g., Vendée is capitalized in **petit basset griffon Vendée** because it's a region in France). 

**Capital letters are not used when lowercase** (mandarin duck) **has been entrenched through usage.** The dictionary is a good guide. 


**lowercase (examples)**
angora (cat, rabbit, etc.), basset hound, blue jay, brown trout, chinook salmon, collie, dachshund, dragonfly, grizzly bear, herring gull, malamute, mallard, mandarin duck, massasauga snake, muskellunge (a fish), pekinese, pike, pinto, smallmouth bass, spaniel, shorthorn, snapping turtle, snowy owl, spaniel, western rattlesnake


**capitalized names (examples)**
Angus cattle, Arctic fox, Baltimore oriole, Canada goose, Clydesdale horse, Dalmatian, Doberman pinscher, German shepherd, Great Dane, Guernsey cow, Holstein-Friesian, Irish terrier, Jersey cow, Kodiak bear, Labrador retriever, Newfoundland dog, Rottweiler, Scottish terrier, St. Bernard, Shetland pony, Siamese cat, wire fox terrier

See also [Latin scientific names](/home/l/latin-scientific-names) (_Branta canadensis_ and _Homo sapiens_) for guidelines on capital letters and italics.

**Use the pronoun it** (possessive its) **for most animals, unless the sex has been established** in a story (e.g., a person's pet, a zoo's elephant). See [problems with pronouns](/home/p/problems-with-pronouns) for related guidelines.

See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) (an overview).

### Antarctic Ocean

**Antarctic Ocean**

**Prefer Antarctic Ocean when referring to the body of water around the world's southern pole.** It's immediately understood by our audience as the opposite of the Arctic Ocean. **Generally avoid the much more vague noun Southern Ocean** — which has different meanings to different people (e.g., Australians refer to the water directly south of them as the Southern Ocean).

Geographers debate the boundary of the Antarctic Ocean. For this reason, it's usually more meaningful to be as specific as possible (e.g., when accurate, refer to the southern Atlantic, the southern Indian Ocean, the southern Pacific Ocean, or to a precise location, such as "about 200 kilometres southwest of Australia").

See also [Arctic](/home/a/arctic) for various guidelines, including capitalization (Arctic hare versus arctic chill)

### anti-vaccination

**Distinguish between the anti-vaccination movement and vaccine hesitancy. Anti-vaccination means a general, dogmatic opposition** to vaccines while **vaccine hesitancy implies a non-ideological reluctance** to get one or more specific vaccines — based on concerns about everything from how quickly they were developed (e.g., during a pandemic) to how trustworthy the evidence is that they're safe and effective.

Put another way: "Hesitancy" normally suggests delay, indecision, vacillation, etc., rather than the comparatively blanket resistance typically articulated by people who campaign against the conventional medical wisdom of vaccinations. However, **there can be overlap. If anti-vaccine campaigners spread false, distorted or unproven information widely,** large numbers of people can become nervous or uncertain about the advice of reputable public health officials. **In 2019, the World Health Organization listed "vaccine hesitancy" as one of the top 10 threats to global health.**


**CAVEAT:** In coverage of certain stories, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, **it's also important to differentiate between (i) those opposed to vaccinations and (ii) those specifically opposed to mandatory vaccinations** or to a range of restrictions imposed on people who have not been vaccinated, such as limits associated with the introduction of government-issued [vaccine passports](/home/p#passports). The latter group can include individuals who have been vaccinated but who advocate personal liberty over various public health measures. Use clear, direct language that matches known facts (e.g., "Hundreds of people gathered outside the legislation to demonstrate against mandatory vaccinations"). When condensing such detail into headlines, news alerts, etc., keep in mind that **word order can affect clarity.** For instance, an expression such as **anti-mandatory vaccine protests** stresses opposition to specific rules while an expression like "anti-vaccine mandate protests" can be inadvertently misheard or misread as opposition to vaccinations in general. The subtleties of **a prefix can make a difference**, too. For instance, avoid the inaccurate and misleading shorthand "anti-vaxx tax" when reporting on what amounts to a public policy debate over a proposed "**no-vax tax**" or a "tax on the unvaccinated."



**Why 'anti-' is accurate**
Be aware that some people challenge the terms "anti-vaccine" and "anti-vaccination" as too broad. They argue that the descriptions do not apply to those who say they're simply reluctant to embrace vaccines until they can be convinced the treatments are safe.

**But the prefix "anti-" actually has shades of meaning. Sometimes it implies outright opposition** to a thing, person, idea, and so forth (e.g., anti-abortion, anti-monarchy). **At other times, however, it simply means general "antagonism toward"** — as in expressing strong reservations, advocating strict limits, etc. This latter sense has been part of the English language for more than 200 years, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Common examples include anti-trade and anti-regulation (i.e. anti-trade often suggests "limits on trade," and anti-regulation often means "minimal government regulation").

Therefore, **if people are largely opposed to virtually all vaccination until they can be persuaded otherwise, it's fair and accurate to say they're currently anti-vaccination rather than pro-vaccination** by any reasonable definition.

IMPORTANT: If a person or group has specific, science-based concerns over the effectiveness of a given vaccine, it's misleading to describe them as part of the general anti-vaccination movement. Instead, vaccine hesitancy is a more appropriate term, as noted at the top of this entry.


**Anti-vaxx, anti-vaxxer** **(OK but exercise restraint)**
**Avoid archaic wording** (e.g., "anti-vaccinationist," coined in the 1880s). Generally **prefer simpler, straightforward language (e.g., "people opposed to vaccines").
**
The shorthand **anti-vaxx and anti-vaxxer are acceptable colloquialisms**, especially when space is tight (e.g., in a headline). **But overuse can unintentionally change a story's overall tone.** Anti-vaxx is a modifier (e.g., an anti-vaxx leaflet). Anti-vaxxer is an agent noun. Both are derived from the compound "anti-vaccination." **Exercise restraint to avoid even the perception of belittling or demonizing people** (i.e., do not use "anti-vaxx" or "anti-vaxxer" throughout stories). Instead, prefer accurate, succinct descriptions over labels whenever practical (e.g., "They're against vaccines" instead of "They're anti-vaxxers").

**Avoid language that's inherently judgmental** (e.g., "vaccine-denier") unless attributed. (See [denier](/home/d/denier) for related guidelines)


**Responsible, fact-based reporting**
When directly relevant to a story, it's helpful to briefly state why a group or an individual is against vaccination. But **always make it clear that most medical experts advocate vaccination as a safe, effective way to help prevent the spread of various illnesses**. As Health Canada puts it:


> _"Vaccination is one of the world's greatest public health achievements. For over 50 years, vaccines have helped prevent and control the spread of deadly diseases and saved the lives of millions of infants, children and adults."
> — [Regulating vaccines for human use in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/biologics-radiopharmaceuticals-genetic-therapies/activities/fact-sheets/regulation-vaccines-human-canada.html)_ [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fpublic-health%2Fservices%2Fimmunization-vaccine-priorities%2Fimmunization-partnership-fund.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2-HeOx7UAPX0H8abcess3Q)


**Many respected public health authorities rank vaccination in the same life-saving league as sanitation, antibiotics and clean drinking water.** They point out that **some of the diseases now preventable by vaccines have no effective treatment or cure** (e.g., measles, mumps and polio). And they stress that children can become very sick, suffer lifelong disability, or die due to complications of vaccine-preventable diseases.

While we can, and should, report different perspectives over time, including any verified cases of problems associated with specific vaccinations. But **the journalistic principles of fairness and balance do not require us to give equal weight to unorthodox or fringe opinions that challenge prevailing, science-based public health policy in every story.**

### anti versus anti- **anti versus anti-**

For preferred vowel sound, see the [pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D33574&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0E25B66GwH4mZ_PA4snNAl).

**In general, do not put a hyphen after the prefix "anti" unless it's followed by either a vowel** (_anti-inflammatory_) **or a capital letter** (anti-Canadian):

anti-abortion
anti-aircraft
anti-American
antibiotic
antibody
anti-Canadian
Antichrist (name from the Bible)
anti-Christ (opposed to Christ)
anticlimax
antidepressant
antidote
antifreeze
antihistamine
anti-inflammatory
anti-inflation
anti-intellectual

antiseptic
antitrust
antivenin (not venom)
antiviral
antivirus
antiwar

But there are exceptions to each rule. **Hyphens are sometimes used in newly coined terms, to make words easier to read or because of long-established practice:
**
anti-ballistic missiles (see [ABMs](/home/a#antiballisticmissiles))
anti-democratic
anti-discrimination
anti-gravity
anti-nuclear
anti-social
anti-terrorism
Anti-terrorism Act (official name of federal legislation in Canada)

Each news organization has its own approach. **If the word is not in this list, consult the Canadian Oxford _Spelling_ Dictionary,** which is a clearer guide for hyphens than the main Canadian Oxford. (All CBC newsrooms have access to an online version. See the Language Guide's [spelling overview](/home/s/spelling) for details.)

By the way, there's no need for hyphens before vowels when "anti" has already been shortened to "ant" (_antacid_ and _antalkali_).

**Are we anti-anti?**
In Shakespeare's day, there were virtually no "anti-" compounds, according to New Fowler's Modern English Usage, with the exception of Antichrist and a few fused words like antidote and antipathy. Now, however, it says the number of possibilities seems almost limitless.

**Avoid using most of these newly coined and often awkward-looking compounds** (e.g., "_anti-junta forces_"), **especially when recasting would make sentences more natural** (e.g., "_armed peasants fighting the junta_").

See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens)

### Anyone versus any one

**Anyone versus any one**

**We normally write _anyone_** as one word. The pronoun means anybody:


_Anyone can sing that song._

**Split _any_ and _one_ into two words only when “one” functions as a number:**

_Any one of them can sing that song._

**HINT:** If you can insert the adjective “single” between _any_ and _one_, then the words should be separated:

_Any single one of them can sing that song._

### Arabic names

**Arabic names**

**Arabic names in English are mere approximations.** The sounds and original spellings sometimes vary from one region to another, leading to inconsistent transliterations.

**In addition to trying to pick which letters best represent the vowel sounds we're hearing** (_al-Qaeda_ versus _al-Qaida_), **journalists must also make decisions about the use of hyphens, spaces and capital letters.** For instance, the New York Times Manual of Style and Usage points out that the definite article "al" may be left on its own or blended into other words, the "a" in "al" may turn into an "e" or "u," and the "l" may disappear altogether through elision. In most cases, it comes down to convention. See [Al-](/home/a#al) for other examples (Al-Ahram but Al Samoud).

The same is true of "el." For instance, Egypt's _Abdel Fattah el-Sisi_, which some news organizations write as _al-Sisi_ (with an "a" instead of an "e"). Even deciding what follows the "el" or the "al" is debatable (e.g., _Sisi_ or _Sissi_, hyphen or no hyphen). During coverage of Egypt's elections in the spring of 2014, at least four different transliterations of his name were used by major media outlets. Most news organizations in North America initially adopted the double "s" spelling (el-Sissi), including the CBC, but then shifted to "_el-Sisi_" by late 2017 as the latter transliteration became increasingly common.

Common words like _Abu_ (which means father of) can appear as "Abubakr" or "Abul Zalaf," while _bin_ (which means son of, as in Osama bin Laden) is sometimes written as _ibn_ or _ben_. In second reference, the particle _bin_ is retained (bin Laden). A capital letter is used at the start of sentences or headlines (Bin Laden). See also [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for general guidelines (French, Spanish, Dutch, etc.).

**If someone has adopted a specific spelling in English, use that preference. If there's no personal preference but a particular spelling has been established through usage, go with that. In general, follow Canadian Press rulings when they're available unless told otherwise** by our [standards editor](/contact-us). For example, CP switched to the AP spelling al-Qaida several years ago, but after decades of writing **al-Qaeda** we decided to stick with the latter because there was no compelling editorial reason to change. As of mid-2022, the New York Times, Globe and Mail, BBC and countless other organizations continued to use al-Qaeda, as well.

**Do not make up your own spellings.** For advice on how to handle foreign names you're not sure how to write in English, see [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations). The entry includes guidelines on dealing with inconsistent approaches to the same proper noun by various wire services.

**Arabic names are usually two or three words long. We generally treat the last one in this sequence as the family name used to identify someone in subsequent references.** (Moammar Gadhafi becomes Gadhafi).

**But there are exceptions when a person is commonly known by one of the other names**, as in _Saddam_ for former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (1937-2006).

### Arafat, Yasser

**Arafat, Yasser**

**Former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat

Arafat was originally known as "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini," according to the Nobel Foundation's website. He changed it to Yasser (sometimes spelled Yasir, or Yassir) Arafat years later.

**He went by several other names** (with various spellings), including Abu Amar. **We always call him Yasser Arafat.

### Arctic

**Arctic, High Arctic, Far North, the North**

There aren't tidy, universally accepted definitions of these terms in Canada. Arctic, for instance, is as much a regional identity as a geographical reference, and it commonly applies to some communities below the Arctic Circle.

To keep our word choice accurate, clear and consistent, CBC News prefers the following usage, based on widely entrenched conventions:




**Arctic**
**In the narrowest sense of the noun, Arctic refers to the region above the Arctic Circle** — which runs about halfway between the 66th and 67th parallels, cutting across the tips of [Yukon](/home/y/yukon) and the Northwest Territories and through the middle of Nunavut. **It includes Inuvik and Resolute.** The **Arctic Circle** marks the start of "polar days," when at least once during the year the sun doesn't set during a 24-hour period, and at least once during the year the sun isn't visible during a 24-hour period.

**Conventionally, however, Canada's Arctic also refers some areas that are below the Arctic Circle, depending on where the treeline ends.** For this reason, **it's acceptable to describe communities like Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Cape Dorset and Coral Habour as Arctic.** But when using this expanded meaning in stories, avoid lumping in places that are not Arctic-like (e.g., do not include Whitehorse or Yellowknife). See [Far North](/) below for more details.

**Use a capital letter when referring to the Arctic itself:**

> _Arctic Circle, Arctic Ocean, High Arctic, Arctic fish, Arctic hare_


**This includes literal references to the Arctic in weather forecasts**, etc.


> _Arctic air, Arctic cold front, Arctic winds_


Arctic in the above context is comparable to proper noun components in other geographically based meteorological terms, such as _an Alberta clipper_.

**But use lowercase for what amount to figurative expressions** (e.g., generic terms that simply convey the sense of extreme cold in any place):

> _An arctic chill in the room, arctic temperatures in Winnipeg_, etc.


Note: The body of water around the southern pole is called the [Antarctic Ocean](/home/a/antarctic-ocean).


**High Arctic**
The term High Arctic can be used to refer to **high-latitude land and water in the Arctic**. This normally means the northern tip of Baffin Island (e.g., **Pond Inlet**), as well as all of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, including Ellesmere Island (e.g., **Grise Fiord** and **Canadian Forces Station Alert**) and the rest of **the Canadian Arctic Archipelago north of the Parry Channel**. The High Arctic includes Parry Channel, itself, which runs from Lancaster Sound to M'Clure Strait. (Note the spelling of M'Clure, which is named after the 19th century explorer Sir Robert M'Clure.) This channel is the central stretch of the **Northwest Passage** — the Arctic water route that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

**Generally avoid the vaguer compound Low Arctic**, which is not only comparatively obscure but also unhelpfully ambiguous. Depending on the person using the label, "Low Arctic" can mean either (a) the area between the High Arctic and the Arctic Circle, or (b) the southern portion of a more broadly defined Arctic, including some areas beneath the Arctic Circle. **Also try to steer clear of the term Subarctic**, which is simply a bombastic name for territory immediately below (south) of the Arctic Circle.


**Far North**
**The term Far North traditionally refers to Canada's Arctic as well as to non-Arctic areas above the treeline. It includes Dawson, Whitehorse and Yellowknife.**

While the **treeline** is commonly considered the region's southern boundary, be aware that the noun is imprecise and sometimes confusing because ribbons of stunted trees thrive far into the tundra, depending on factors such as elevation, changing climate and evolving plant species. Although sometimes used as a synonym, the word **timberline** normally describes where trees stop growing on mountains.

**Regional differences are worth noting. Far North is a relative term**, since people who live in Canada's North don't see it as "Far." For this reason, **it generally has less currency the farther north you travel.**

But just as the "Middle East" has come to mean something on its own, regardless of the modifier "Middle," the practical and common compound "Far North" is acceptable when we want to talk about the Arctic as well as areas close to the Arctic in journalism produced for a general audience.

A good rule of thumb: **National stories involving a combination of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and/or Yukon normally refer to the Far North, while stories involving Nunavut alone and/or the Beaufort Sea area of the N.W.T.** (e.g., Tuktoyaktuk) **generally refer to the Arctic.** See [Arctic](/home/a/arctic#Arctic) above for details.


**Examples of preferred usage:**

-   A story about Inuvik refers to **the Arctic**.
-   A trip by the prime minister to Whitehorse, Yellowknife and Resolute is a visit to **the Far North** rather than to the Arctic, even though it includes a stop in the Arctic. Another acceptable description is the prime minister's annual trip to **the North**.
-   A national park west of Yellowknife, near the N.W.T. border with Yukon, is a **northern national park**, or a park in Canada's **Far North**, but not an Arctic national park. 

**Canada's North**
**This is a sweeping label that includes the Arctic and Far North, as well as areas slightly farther south.**

**There is no simple definition of "North."** Academics measure debatable "nordicity scales" of climate, geographical location, topography, population density, etc., to rank a wide range of "northerness levels" in Canada.

In national media coverage, however, **the North conventionally means Yukon, N.W.T., Nunavut and the uppermost swaths of various provinces.** Once again, regional usage is sometimes different, especially in stories produced for a northern audience (e.g., a radio report in Yellowknife about "the North" may well convey a different meaning than one in Regina).

### Asian names

**Asian names**

**In China, Korea and several other Asian countries, the family name comes first, followed by a given name.** So _Mao Zedong_ would be _Mao_ in second reference, _Deng Xiaoping_ would be _Deng_, North Korean leader _Kim Jong-un_ would be _Kim_, and _Chinese President Xi Jinping_ would be _Xi_ or _President Xi_. Be aware that capitalization and hyphenation of Asian names can vary, depending on established usage and individual preference (e.g., South Korean President _Yoon Suk Yeol_, rather than "_Yoon Suk-yeol,_" is _Yoon_ in second reference).

**In other countries, such as Myanmar, there's really no equivalent to surnames, and known personal preferences guide us** (along with entrenched usage in the case of some famous figures). For example, former UN secretary general _U Thant_ is historically "U Thant" in first reference, even though "U" is the equivalent of the honorific "Mr.," and _Thant_ in second reference. And Myanmar's pro-democracy leader _Aung San Suu Kyi_ traditionally becomes _Suu Kyi_ in second reference.

**Be aware of subtle complexities** in the naming conventions of various countries. **In Vietnamese names, for instance, Van is normally uppercase** in the full name and frequently dropped in second reference. So former Vietnamese prime minister **Phan Van Khai** becomes **Khai**, and **Nguyen Van Thanh** becomes **Thanh**. (See also [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for related guidelines on handling non-Asian names, such as Vincent van Gogh.) It's worth stressing that in both cases, the second reference is actually the person's given name — i.e., Khai and Thanh — based on entrenched Vietnamese custom. In other words, **while Vietnamese family names are generally listed first when a complete name is reported, the given name rather than the family name is traditionally reported in subsequent references**, which can mislead some foreigners into assuming that Vietnamese names follow the Western tradition of placing family names last. Watch out for exceptions, however, such as the historical figure **Ho Chi Minh** who went by Ho in second reference.


**Japanese names**
**In Japan, names rendered in English are undergoing a transition.** In late 2019, the government of Japan asked Western news organizations to consider reporting its citizens' family names first as a way of reclaiming a pre-Meiji era tradition. But not everyone in the country adopted this style, which represents a departure from roughly 150 years of practice. Indeed, the approach remains so inconsistent and potentially confusing in Japan that romanized family names are now commonly written either entirely in capital letters (e.g., ABE Shinzo) or are followed by commas (e.g., Abe, Shinzo) to flag them in first reference. Furthermore, as of mid-2022, the country's oldest and largest English newspaper, the Japan Times, continued to use the old system because it's so familiar (e.g., it posted the headline "Former prime minister **Shinzo Abe** assassinated" on its website July 8, 2022).

**Our current style is to continue to put Japanese family names last in the sequence** (e.g., artist and peace activist **Yoko Ono** becomes Ono in second reference) **unless a specific individual is known to prefer a different approach**. This includes references to historical figures (e.g., filmmaker **Akira Kurosawa** and music teacher **Shinichi Suzuki**). Most major news organizations in the West take a similar tack. We will continue to monitor the naming convention, however, and consider adjusting our style if the pre-Meiji practice of putting Japanese family names first becomes the norm.

**His name is Bill Lee. Lee said ...**
**English spellings of mainland Chinese names are generally based on Pinyin** (which means "spell sound"). Under this system, roman letters usually approximate English sounds. But there are exceptions. For example, "x" represents "sy" or "ch."

**The names of many historical figures retain their older spellings** (e.g., _Confucius_, which is a Latin version of K'ung Fu-tzu, which in turn is a Wade-Giles transliteration of "Kong the master"). **But others do not** (_Mao Zedong,_ not Mao Tse-tung, and _Zhou Enlai_, not Chou En-lai).

**Many Asian people living in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the West have adopted surnames, so follow entrenched preferences.** (_William Woo_ would be _Woo_ in second reference.) This sometimes means a person living outside China puts the family name second while relatives still living in China continue to put it first. For instance, a university student from China murdered and dismembered in Montreal in 2012 preferred to be called Jun Lin (with Lin used in second reference). His father, however, was identified as Lin Diran. Again, known preferences should be followed, with extra detail included in stories whenever required to ensure clarity (e.g., repeating labels like father or mother in second reference).

**Non-Pinyin spellings are common outside of Beijing's influence. Follow people's preferences.** If the preference is not known, **do not guess.** Instead, determine the correct rendering of such names through traditional newsgathering channels.

### assassination

**Assassination**

The word assassination can be generally defined as **a sudden and fatal attack against a prominent person that's linked to the person's fame or status** (as opposed to being, say, the result of a personal quarrel or a random act of violence). This includes high-profile public figures, such as government leaders and artists, as well as senior members of religious communities, human rights groups, military organizations, crime families, etc.

While assassination used to be more narrowly defined as the murder of well-known people for political or religious reasons, **the exact motivation is not always clear** (e.g., the death of John F. Kennedy was undoubtedly an assassination, but exactly how and why it was carried out are passionately debated to this day). And **sometimes the reason for the attack may simply be the madness or instability of the assassin** rather than a specifically articulated political or religious motive (e.g., the fatal shooting of musician John Lennon in 1980 is conventionally referred to as an assassination).

**Avoid labelling routine killings as assassinations.** Use common sense. For example, if the head of a political party is gunned down while delivering a speech, the word "assassinated" almost certainly applies — unless there's evidence the person was not actually targeted but simply shot by mistake. But if the same politician is killed in private by a jilted lover, the term "murdered" is a better choice.

See also [**assassination versus targeted killing**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#assassination) in the Middle East glossary.

### Assembly

**Assembly versus assembly**

**Use a capital letter if it refers to a _national_ or _international_ body, or to a Canadian provincial or territorial legislature:**



> _UN General Assembly
> __the General Assembly
> __France’s National Assembly
> __Quebec National Assembly
> _Newfoundland and Labrador _House of Assembly_


But keep the word assembly lowercase on its own or in generic references:


> assembly member
> the assembly (but the National Assembly and the House of Assembly)
> the assembly building

### assisted\_dying

**Assisted dying (assisted suicide)**

The terms **assisted dying** and **medical assistance in dying** (**MAID**) have **largely replaced the expression assisted suicide** in public policy debates over the rights of grievously and irremediably ill Canadians seeking help to end their lives. The Supreme Court of Canada adopted this language when reviewing what had been blanket prohibitions against suicide assistance in 2015. Furthermore, Section 241.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada has specifically referred to "medical assistance in dying" since 2016.

It's **not automatically wrong to use the entrenched expression "assisted suicide"** in our reporting when the facts fit. **But assisted dying, assisted death, etc., are often preferred** by patients and medical personnel. While such wording was once dismissed as vague and potentially confusing, it's now instantly clear to our audience, based on widespread usage.

**For many years**, doctors, legislators and the **courts differentiated between euthanasia and assisted dying, also known as assisted suicide.** In this context, euthanasia once meant taking the final steps to end a person's life (e.g., administering a lethal drug dose). By contrast, assisted dying, also known as assisted suicide, once normally meant providing someone with the means to end their own life, but then leaving the final act to them (e.g., prescribing or supplying drugs only, without actually giving them the injection, starting the intravenous drip, helping them swallow the pills, etc.). A distinction is still maintained in some parts of the world. **But in Canada, the lines between euthanasia and assisted dying have become blurred.** (See [euthanasia](/home/e/euthanasia#historical) for detailed historical perspective and related guidelines, including why "withdrawal of life-support" is not normally considered euthanasia.)


**NOTE:**

-   **Use neutral wording.** Be cautious with common but potentially problematic synonyms. For instance, **avoid language such as "dying with dignity" unless attributed**. Formal names of groups and other proper nouns are exceptions (e.g., the Death with Dignity Act). It's a good idea to **take the same approach with "mercy killing,"** which is perceived as biased by some who think the expression strongly implies homicide. **When reporting on specific cases, generally favour the language used by the family and/or doctor** (e.g., "medical assistance in dying").

-   **Prefer the modifier "medical"** over"doctor" or "physician" in assisted dying stories (e.g., **medically assisted death**), since nurses, pharmacists and other health-care professionals may be involved. And generally **spell out the acronym MAID in first reference** ("**medical assistance in dying**"). Exceptions are web headlines, TV banners, etc., where space is limited.

-   The term **"right to die" requires care**. When assisted dying is at the centre of a legal challenge by someone who wants to end her own life, it's usually acceptable to describe it as a right-to-die case, since that frames the debate succinctly. However, some critics argue that the term "right to die" fails to convey what they argue is really at stake: the "right to kill" oneself or others. Increasingly common, neutral alternatives for "right-to-die legislation" are "**assisted dying laws**" and "**end-of-life laws**."

-   **Provide fair balance.** It's valuable to **acknowledge both sides of the debate whenever practical**. This does not necessarily mean giving advocates and critics of assisted dying equal time in every story, or downplaying the suffering of people who want to end their lives. But it's crucial to include this perspective over time. In coverage of proposals to relax MAID eligibility requirements, for instance, we should strive to include pro and con voices (e.g., opponents believe that assisted dying laws increase the risk of elderly and disabled people having their lives ended prematurely, or of being pressured into agreeing to die).

-   **Do not glorify assisted dying or assisted suicide. Include only relevant facts that are necessary to tell the story.** There's generally no need to show video or pictures of how someone died, such as images of equipment used, unless it's central to a followup report (e.g., key evidence at a criminal trial involving allegations that someone unlawfully helped a person kill themselves). Even in those cases, exercise restraint. Descriptions of the death should not include sensational or gratuitous details.

### Asteroids, meteors

**Asteroids, comets and meteors**

The terms asteroid, comet, meteor, meteoroid and meteorite are sometimes mixed up. This isn't surprising, since these words have been very loosely defined over the centuries. Astronomers, themselves, often use technical jargon, like "small solar system bodies." But in our journalism, the older, more familiar words are normally preferred.

Here are brief guidelines we follow to keep our stories clear and accurate. The definitions below are based on surveys of language used by various space authorities, such as NASA, as well as entrenched conventions.





**asteroids**
**An asteroid is a rocky object in space that's smaller than a planet.** Most are irregularly shaped and made up of different materials, including various metals and minerals. Asteroids **commonly range in size from hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres across**. Although they have no atmosphere, many are large enough to exert gravitational pull. These are sometimes called minor planets or planetoids. For instance, the asteroid Ceres, which has also been known as a dwarf planet since 2006, is about 940 kilometres across. Most asteroids in our solar system are much smaller. **When they're less than 100 metres wide, they're commonly called [meteoroids](/home/a/asteroids-meteors#meteoroids).** Millions of asteroids are believed to orbit the sun, although many are too small to be detected from Earth. More than half a million asteroids have been catalogued. Most are found in what's called the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which includes about 40,000 asteroids with diameters of at least one kilometre each. When a large asteroid slams into Earth, the impact can be catastrophic. Based on statistical models, experts estimate that an asteroid wider than one kilometer collides with our planet about once every half a million years.


**comets**
A comet is sometimes called a big, dirty "snowball" in space. **Comets are made up of loosely formed ice, dust, small rocky particles and organic compounds.** The ice isn't just frozen water. It can include carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and other substances. Comets can be **up to several kilometres in diameter.** They're **similar to asteroids but have tails of dust and gas**, which are produced as they approach the sun and the ice starts to vaporize.

Style note: The word comet is lowercase even in proper nouns (e.g., Halley's comet), along the lines of the generic words asteroid, nebula and star in the asteroid Vesta, the Andromeda nebula and Luyten’s star.


**meteoroids**
A meteoroid is **essentially a small [asteroid](/home/a/asteroids-meteors#asteroids) or debris from a [comet](/home/a/asteroids-meteors#comets)**. There's **no universally applied criteria, such as size or density**. On some scales, meteoroids range from a very small speck to something as big as a boulder. On other scales, meteoroids can have diameters of up to 100 metres. Depending on a given story's facts, it's **acceptable to refer to certain meteoroids as small asteroids**.


**meteors**
**A meteor** (commonly called a "**shooting star**") is simply **a meteoroid that's entered a planet's atmosphere**. Friction heats meteors as they plummet, making them glow and producing a bright streak visible to the naked eye. At least a few can be seen on any given night. When a lot appear (e.g., hundreds per hour), the term **meteor shower** is commonly used. Many meteors vaporize entirely. When large ones break up in the lower atmosphere, the explosive force sometimes produces powerful sonic waves that can cause damage (e.g., shattered windows) on the ground. **Any parts of a meteor that actually strike a planet are called meteorites.**


**meteorites**
**A meteorite is what's left of a meteor when it hits a planet.** Meteorites **usually range in size from tiny grains to large boulders.** They're made up of different rocky and metallic substances, including nickel-iron alloy. Since meteorites are extremely hot and travelling very fast, they can virtually disintegrate upon impact, leaving behind craters and wide areas of dust and melted ore. Large meteorites, such as the one that slammed into Arizona about 50,000 years ago — forming what's known as Meteor Crater in the U.S. — can explode with a force more powerful than hundreds of nuclear bombs. Such strikes are relatively rare, according to experts, occurring about once every 6,000 years. The Earth has been hit by much smaller meteorites countless times. Scientists, for example, have recovered more than 10,000 meteorite specimens from Antarctica alone.

**[Barren Lands](/home/b/barrens), the Barrens**

**barrier** (Israel's structure in the West Bank) Avoid "fence" or "wall," as well as adjectives such as "security" barrier or "apartheid" wall. Use barrier or **West Bank barrier**. See [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#barrier) for details and related guidelines.

**Barron's** (a Dow Jones weekly financial publication)

**BASE jump, BASE jumper, BASE jumping** (Parachute jumping from a fixed point, such as a high building or cliff, rather than from an aircraft) The abbreviation — "building, antenna, span, earth" — does NOT need to be spelled out. But the term's meaning should be explained high in new stories unless already clear from context (e.g., a TV report showing video of the jump does not require a definition). BASE jumping is not the same as skydiving, which normally implies plummeting from a plane, or bungee jumping, which refers to a tethered plunge. See also the overview on [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines.

**bazaar** (marketplace; large store), **bizarre** (strange)

**BB** (small pellet used in BB guns)

**B-boy, B-girl** Since the 1980s, people who breakdance – also known as breaking, and introduced as an Olympic competition in 2024 – have been known as B-boys and B-girls. The word “breaker” is also an appropriate and gender-neutral term.

**B.C.** (OK in first reference for British Columbia) See also [provinces](/home/p/provinces-and-cities)

**B.C. Coroners Service, B.C. Ferries, B.C. Hydro, B.C. Liberals, B.C. Lions, B.C. NDP, B.C.

Wildfire Service and N.B. Power but SaskPower and WorkplaceNL).

**BC** (unnecessary to spell out "before Christ" when labelling years) Unlike [AD](/home/a#AD), the abbreviation BC is placed after the figure, as in "**75 BC**." Another common construction: the **first century BC**.

BCE (see [**Bell Canada**](/home/b#Bell))

**[b-bd](/home/b#b) -** **[be-bn](/home/b#be) -** **[bo-by](/home/b#bo) - [bottom](/home/b#bottom)**

**be-bn**
**beau**, (plural **beaus** _not_ beaux)

**bedbug** (one word)

**beck and call** (_not_ beckon call)

**bed blocker** (_AVOID unless attributed via broadcast clips or directly transcribed quotes_) Colloquially refers to elderly people or others who are in hospitals rather than in facilities considered more appropriate to their needs, such as nursing homes. Perceived as offensive by some because the label blames a specific group for blocking beds rather than identifying root problems, such as overcrowded long-term care facilities and other resource shortages. The term also lacks neutrality because it can imply that more worthy patients are being denied treatment.

**beef Stroganoff**

**beer** (singular), **beers** (preferred plural, even though the "s" is sometimes dropped in conversation and informal writing) "She drank one beer," and "He had four beers," and "Some beers are brewed with malted wheat instead of malted barley." See also [plurals overview](/home/p/plurals)

**Beersheba, Israel** (avoid other [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), such as Be'er Sheva) The city is about 40 kilometres from the Gaza Strip. The nearby Ela Prison, a few kilometres to the south, is surrounded by desert. It is conventionally called the **Beersheba prison** or the **Beersheba detention centre**. Some of the facility's holding cells are used for people awaiting possible charges, deportation, etc.

**Beethoven, Ludwig van** (_not_ von) Use Beethoven (without van) in second reference. (1770-1827)

[**begs the question**](/home/b/begs-the-question) (_avoid_ as a mere substitute for _raises_ or _prompts_ the question)

**behaviour**

**Belgrade** (not "Beograd," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Belize** (formerly British Honduras)

**Bell Canada Inc.** (formerly called BCE Inc.) The parent company Bell Canada Enterprises changed its name in 2007. **Bell Canada** is generally fine, although "Inc." is preferred in first reference in business stories. The telecommunications giant controls several divisions, including **Bell Aliant**, **Bell ExpressVu**, **Bell Mobility**, and **Sympatico** (the internet service).

Bell Globemedia (previously controlled by BCE Inc.) changed name to **CTVglobemedia** in 2007.

**belligerent**

**bellwether** (_not_ bellweather)

**Belmont Stakes**

**beluga** (whale)

**bemused** (means confused) Not a fancy synonym for amused. Bemusement refers to puzzlement not entertainment. It originally meant absorbed in thought (to "be mused"). The word gradually evolved to describe people who are addled or bewildered.

**benefit, benefited, benefiting**

**bestseller** (one word), **bestselling** author

**better** (improvement); **bettor** (gambler; person who bets)

**Beyoncé** (singer) It's virtually never necessary to spell out her full name: Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (For related guidelines, see [French words and accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) as well as [single name identification and attribution](/home/q/quotes-overview#second-reference-names) for certain celebrities, like Adele and Drake)

**biased** (only one "s")

**Bible, Bible Belt** (but lowercase for general guides like **car buyer's bible**, unless part of a proper noun, such as the **Vegetable Gardener's Bible**) Be aware that lowercase usage can be perceived as exclusionary because "bible" does not have the same meaning outside of Judeo-Christian faiths. For this reason, generally prefer alternative wording. Options vary depending on context (e.g., a **guide**, an **encyclopedia**, a **handbook**, a **treasury**, a **compendium**, a **playbook**, a **manual**).

**biblical**

**Bic** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for pen)

**bicultural, bilingual** (no hyphen)

**biannual** (twice a year); **biennial** (every two years) But _generally avoid_ (See [bi](/home/b/bi))

**bimonthly, biweekly** (_Generally avoid these terms_) See [bi](/home/b/bi)

**Big Ben** (an iconic hourly bell in London, England; _not_ the tower, the clock or the clock's smaller bells) The Westminster Clock Tower was officially renamed the **Elizabeth Tower** in 2012 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. It's OK to continue to call the structure Big Ben's tower (small "t"), but avoid shortening this to Big Ben unless you're referring only to the hourly bell. See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames#overuse).

**Bigfoot** (singular and plural) Limit to stories about reports of hairy, human-like creatures in the U.S. Use [sasquatch](/home/a#abominable) for similar stories in Canada.

**Big Five, the big companies; Big Ten** (U.S. intercollegiate athletic conference), the big universities; the [big banks](/home/b/banks), etc.

**Big Three** (generally avoid except in historical references to GM, Ford and Chrysler) Prefer [the Detroit Three](/home/d#DetroitThree).

**big-time** (adj.), **big time** (noun)

**bill** (**Bill 101**; **Bill C-38**; a proposed **trade bill**) See [Act versus act](/home/a/act) as well as [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

**billet, billeted, billeting**

**Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport** (known as the "Toronto City Centre Airport" until 2009) While it's important to use the new name for accuracy, the full version is not always necessary. Depending on the story (regional or national), acceptable options include: the **Toronto City Airport** (uppercase "A" because it's a clipped form of the new proper noun), the **Toronto Island airport** (lowercase "a" because it's a descriptive name) and **Toronto's downtown island airport**. If the full name is used, **Billy Bishop** is acceptable in second reference. But make sure there's no confusion between the Toronto City Airport and, say, the **Owen Sound Billy Bishop Regional Airport** in a completely different community in Ontario. (See also [Airport versus airport](/home/a/airport))

**birth, birthday, birthmark, birthrate, birthright**

**Bismarck** (not -rk)

**bismuth** (natural metallic element used in alloys; also a compound used in medicine)

**bitcoin** (a specific type of [cryptocurrency](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#cryptocurrency "C")) As with all currency names (dollars, euros, kronor, yen), keep lowercase (15 million bitcoins, a billion bitcoins, a **bitcoin ABM**), except when part of a proper noun (e.g., "**_Bitcoiniacs_**_, a store in Vancouver that sells bitcoins"_). See also [money](/home/m/money) for related style guidelines

**bitumen** (thick to semi-solid form of petroleum) Crude bitumen cannot be pumped without being heated or diluted. It is not the same as "heavy oil," which is less dense. The unrefined substance being extracted from the [oilsands](/home/o/oilsands-versus-tarsands) in Alberta should be referred to as bitumen. In order to transport bitumen in pipes it must be diluted. Although the term "**dilbit**" is sometimes used, the word remains too obscure for news stories unless it's defined as **diluted bitumen** in first reference.

**[Black](/home/r/racial-terms#Black)** (capitalized for people and culture, as in a **Black person, Black history**), but **black** (lowercase for colour, as in **black skin, blackface**). See also [racial terms](/home/r/racial-terms).

**[blackball](/home/g/gyp)** (avoid without attribution)

**BlackBerry** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for wireless device), BlackBerrys (see [plurals overview](/home/p/plurals))

**black box** (aircraft recording equipment) Although it's OK to use this colloquial label, it's important to specify which equipment we're referring to. Cockpit voice recorders contain audio (conversations between the pilots as well as radio communication), while **flight data recorders** track details such as altitude and speed. Depending on the aircraft, they may be in one container or two separate boxes. Neither is actually black. Instead, the recorders are generally painted bright orange to make them easier to find after a crash. See also [cockpit versus flight deck](/home/c/cockpit-versus-flight-deck)

**Black, Conrad** (almost always prefer his birth name to the peerage Lord Black of Crossharbour) See [titles](/home/t/titles#honorary)

**blackfly, blackflies**

**Black Hawk** The name, and a registered trademark, of [a helicopter built by Sikorsky](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/sikorsky-black-hawk-helicopter.html). Note that [there are several variants](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/sikorsky-black-hawk-helicopter.html#variants).

**[blacklist](/home/g/gyp)** (avoid without attribution)

**black out** (v.), **blackout** (n. and adj.)

**blaze** (a large, brightly burning fire, as opposed to a small or smouldering one) Critics feel this word sounds artificial on air in certain contexts, arguing that they rarely hear people say "blaze" as a synonym for fire in everyday speech. But this does not mean we ban the term. We do talk about "a blaze of glory" and "a blaze of patriotism," so there's no reason we can't describe firefighters "battling a blaze" if that's the best wording for a given story. Use your judgment. Bear in mind, however, that overuse of familiar phrases can make our journalism hackneyed. And always steer clear of wording that is stilted, such as the synonym "conflagration."

**blind, partly blind, legally blind**, etc., but _avoid_ "the blind" (See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#blind))

**blindsided**

**bloc** (of parties, countries, regions; voted as a bloc, **former East Bloc**)

**Bloc Québécois** (Prefer **the Bloc** in second reference, although **BQ** is fine in headlines) See also [Party versus party](/home/p/party), as well as [French words and accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for relevant capitalization guidelines.

**block** (of houses, shares, seats); also impediment, as in mental block

**blog, blogger, blogging, blogosphere**

**blond** (n. and adj. for all uses) _never_ blonde

**bloodbath, bloodthirsty** (one word)

**blood diamonds** (also known as **conflict diamonds**) Both terms are acceptable. The former is older and more familiar. It's generally unnecessary to introduce either with the qualifier "so-called" (or to put them in quotation marks in our online journalism), although this can help flag the words for our audience. Whenever practical, these labels should be briefly explained unless a given story's context already makes the meaning clear. Blood diamonds have been linked to armed struggles in parts of Africa. The gems help finance the fighting. Some terrorist groups have also been accused of using diamonds to transfer large amounts of money outside of the international banking system.

**Bloody Mary** (nickname for Mary I), **bloody mary** (cocktail)

**Bloomberg, Mike** (U.S. media mogul, politician, philanthropist) Use **Mike** instead of "Michael" because it's his stated preference. The former mayor of New York City (2002-2013) is a self-made billionaire who earned his fortune in computerized financial data services.

**blue line** (two words in sports coverage; see [hockey terms](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/hockey/ "Hockey"))

**blue line, thin blue line** (_caution required when referring to police; limit to attributed usage_) The expression originally described military units in battle, and was tied to a given force's uniforms (e.g., the **thin red line**, the thin blue line). It was first applied to police units in the 1960s, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Be aware that some people find the figurative language inappropriate, especially in the context of civilian-police tensions, because they say it implies that officers are separate from society. In the mid-2010s, controversy erupted over slogans like **Blue Lines Matter**, along with flags and uniform patches depicting blue lines. Critics accused some police officers and their supporters of using the symbol as an attack against **Black Lives Matter** protests. Since then, **the term "thin blue line" has become polarizing** — with accusations of racism and antisemitism by critics of the expression, and accusations of anarchy and anti-policing by its defenders. For this reason, **the words should be attributed**, either in broadcast clips and directly transcribed quotes or as elements of proper nouns.

**board of revisers** (Quebec) Lowercase, with "ers" not "ors" as the preferred spelling. During provincial elections, members of the board review and update official voting lists.

**boat, fishing boat, lifeboat, motorboat, powerboat, sailboat**

**bobblehead** (no hyphen), a **bobblehead doll**

**bobsled, bobsledding** (general preference); but **bobsleigh** (official Olympic sport), Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton (governing body). Prefer bobsled to bobsleigh in most contexts (e.g., a four-man bobsled team). Athletes conventionally ride on sleds not sleighs and are usually called bobsledders.

**bodycam** (fused, along the lines of webcam) OK in first reference on its own or as a modifier (e.g. bodycam video). Bodycam does not need to be explicitly defined as an abbreviation of body camera. Body camera, spelled out as two words, is also acceptable. See [camera](/home/c#camera) for related note about normal usage.

**bodycheck**

**bodyguard** (no hyphen)

**body-shaming** (hyphen) See [shaming](/home/s#shaming)

**boldface** (type)

**Bollywood** (common and acceptable term to describe India's largest film production centre, based in Mumbai) Just as Hollywood does not represent the entire film industry in the U.S., however, Bollywood does not refer to India's entire film industry. So geographical references are better to convey nuanced meaning (e.g., movies from India, an Indian film festival). Informal use is fine (e.g., a **Bollywood star**), but respect known preferences by avoiding the word if a person or organization you're referring to objects to it. When reporting on specific events, it's helpful to use the proper noun at least once (e.g., the **International Indian Film Academy Awards** held in Toronto in 2011, also known as the "**Bollywood Oscars**"). Virtually all Bollywood movies are in Hindi, the official language of India. The "B" comes from Bombay, now known as [Mumbai](/home/m#Mumbai). Never use the terms East India or East Indian, for reasons outlined in the entry on [South Asian, Indian, Indo-Canadian](/home/s/south-asian-indian-indo-canadian).

**Bomarc-A, Bomarc-B** (missiles)

**bombardier** (military term, no abbreviation) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**Bombardier** (company)

Bombay (a port city on the west coast of India _renamed_  **Mumbai**) Use the Hindi form Mumbai in first reference. For context in longer stories, it's OK to point out that the city was formerly called Bombay — a name still preferred by some residents. But this is optional and increasingly unnecessary as the noun Mumbai has become widely known. (See [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations))

**bombshell** (one word)

**bona fide** (adj. and adv.) genuine; **bona fides** (n.) proof of status

**bonspiel**

**Book of Common Prayer**

**book of condolence, books of condolence** (_condolence_ is a collective singular here, despite many entries recorded on the book's pages, akin to _sympathy_) **One official book:** "They waited for hours in the rain, inching up Parliament Hill toward the casket and book of condolence." **More than one book:** "Millions of people signed books of condolence in dozens of countries around the world." (See [**funerals**](/home/f/funerals) for related terms)

**Book of Revelation** (_not_ Revelations)

**border crossing, illegal border crossing** (see [refugee, asylum seeker, migrant](/home/r/refugee) for details)

**borscht, the Borscht Belt**

**born** (created; brought into existence); **borne** (withstand; past participle of bear), as in: _They've borne the brunt of the blame_; **borne** (carried or transported, a different past participle of bear), as in: an [airborne](/home/a#airborne) _pathogen_ and a _blood-borne disease_; **borne out** (support or confirm; past participle of bear out), as in the evidence was _borne out_; **Born is normally used when referring to birth — both literally** (_She was born in December_) **and figuratively** (_Melancholy born of solitude_). **Borne is linked to birth only in rare constructions when the mother is said to have carried the child to term, almost a sort of archaic attribution:** _He was borne by Gillian at dawn. It's another case of children borne by teenagers._ **The phrase "gave birth" is more common in these cases:** _Gillian gave birth to him at dawn. All three teenagers gave birth during the summer, before school resumed._

**[Bosnia-Herzegovina](/home/b/balkans#Bosnia)**

**Boston Marathon, Boston Marathon finish line, Boston Marathon bombings**

**Boston Tea Party** (U.S. political party formed in 2006 that wants much smaller government, more responsible spending and lower, simplified taxation) It is named after the Boston Tea Party of 1773, an iconic moment in U.S. history when demonstrators dumped hundreds of chests of tea into a harbour to protest against taxation without representation by the British Crown as well as against the perceived monopoly of a foreign company. The modern [Tea Party movement](/home/t#TeaParty) first gained national attention in 2009. Not all supporters of the movement are formal members of the party. They may merely agree with parts of the platform or attend certain rallies for specific reasons.

**bowl, Cotton Bowl, Rose Bowl, Super Bowl**

**bowling, five-pin** (adj); **bowling, ten-pin** (_not_ 10-pin) Use hyphens in adjectives (e.g., "a five-pin champion"), but not in nouns (e.g., "Although he preferred fivepins, they played tenpins all night"). See also [numbers](/home/n/numbers) for general guidelines on figures spelled out as words.

**BP** (name officially adopted in 2000) **Do not call the company "British Petroleum."** When context is required, add "formerly known as British Petroleum" once in a subsequent on-air reference or in parentheses in an online story. Otherwise, use BP throughout. Unless writing business stories that require special detail, it's unnecessary to add the initials [PLC](/home/p#PLC) (which stand for public limited company) to the noun.

**BQ** (prefer **the Bloc** in second reference to [Bloc Québécois](/home/b#Bloc))

**brackets** (See [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

**braggart**

**braille**

**Brasilia** (capital of Brazil)

**Bravo** (_not_ Bravo!) TV channel (see [names versus logos](/home/n/names-versus-logos) for relevant guidelines)

**Brazil** (country in South America) Use this entrenched English spelling. A common "s" alternative, Brasil, is actually Portuguese. The French version used by our Radio-Canada colleagues is "Brésil." The capital of Brazil is spelled with an "s" in English: Brasilia

**breach** (break contract, etc.; bust through), as in **a security breach** at the company; **step into the breach** (help in a crisis) _compare with [breech](/home/b#breech) below_

**break** (n.), **breakaway, breakdance, breakdown, breakfast, break-in, breakneck, breakout, breakup, breakthrough, breakwater**

**break** (v.), **break away, break down, break even, break in, break off, break out, break up**

**break-in, break-ins** (n.) Colloquial and acceptable shorthand for "break into." Commonly refers to unauthorized access to private property — from houses, businesses and vehicles to computer networks. It's perfectly acceptable to report on, say, an increase or decrease in vehicle break-ins, computer break-ins, residential break-ins, etc. It's also OK to say that a criminal "broke into" a house, an office, a car, a computer, etc. But avoid inaccurately implying that the specific charge of "breaking and entering" automatically applies. The generic noun break-in is not necessarily the same as the specific offence of [breaking and entering](/home/b#breaking-entering). The latter normally applies to "places," which are narrowly defined in the Criminal Code of Canada as either buildings, including animal pens, as well as large vehicles like ships and planes. By contrast, the separate offence of "trespassing" involves the broader term "premises," which many Canadian provinces define as buildings, land, water and various vehicles, including automobiles. It's generally best to include the specific, relevant charges that apply to a given story (e.g., breaking and entering, trespassing, property damage, theft, mischief) when these are known, and when there's room.

**breaking and entering** (no hyphens) is the charge (_not_ "break and enter"). Unless you're referring to the specific indictable offence outlined in the Criminal Code, it's OK to shorten the term (e.g., "He's accused of breaking into the museum," or "He was convicted of three break-ins during the past four years"). _Avoid_ the jargon "b and e," except when transcribing direct quotes. See also [break-in](/home/b#break-in) above for related caveat.

### bacteria versus virus

**Bacteria versus virus**

It's unnecessary to define common terms such as bacteria and virus in stories. But since they have different meanings, it's crucial to use the right word.




**Virus**
Viruses are the simplest known form of microorganism on the planet. Although they can exist on inanimate objects (phones, faucets, doorknobs) for several hours, **viruses need living hosts (plants, animals) to survive and reproduce.** They're generally much smaller than bacteria (between one-tenth and one-hundredth the size). Some viruses nest inside bacteria. Not all viruses are harmful.

**Numerous illnesses and diseases are caused by viruses**, from common colds, influenza (flu) and chickenpox to [AIDS](/home/a/aids) and [SARS](/home/s/sars). Some microorganisms frequently in the news are Ebola virus, West Nile virus, avian flu (H5N1 virus) and swine flu (H1N1 virus). **Antiviral drugs** are used to treat viruses after infection (to reduce symptoms and speed recovery). **Vaccines**, by contrast, are used to try to prevent infection. They sometimes include an **adjuvant** to make them more effective. In stories, this term should be briefly explained (e.g., defined as an "immune booster"). Vaccines without the agent are sometimes called "**non-adjuvant** vaccines" or "**adjuvant-free** vaccines." _Avoid_ disputed constructions, such as _"unadjuvant."_

**Viruses commonly change** as they spread from one host (animal) to another. These mutations may or may not significantly affect transmissibility, illness severity, the effectiveness of specific anti-viral treatments and/or vaccines. **Epidemiologists often distinguish between new "lineages" of a virus and actual new "strains."** Both are forms of mutation, but the number of new strains is usually much smaller than the overall number of logged variations (lineages). **In routine reporting, the words "variant" and "mutation" are often better choices than "lineage"** because they're more familiar. **"Strain" should be reserved for viruses that have not only mutated but also act noticeably different** (e.g., are more infectious, more virulent, require a new or updated vaccine). For this reason, **it's best to steer clear of "strain" unless public health officials are using the term.** NOTE: While new virus strains are less common than mere lineages, a new strain can rapidly become the dominant threat during an epidemic.

**Virus mutations can end up with more than one official designation** (e.g., a variant that surfaced in the U.K. during the COVID-19 pandemic was called "VOC-202012/01" as well as "B.1.1.7," pronounced "B-one-one-seven"). Each component of these lineages represents a unique detail about genome sequencing, geography, chronology, etc. In this case, for instance, the "B" referred to the original novel coronavirus logged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and early 2020, while the first "1" was associated with the big outbreak in Italy and central Europe a few months later. While it's **rarely necessary to include dense alphanumeric designations in stories**, especially broadcast scripts, precision is sometimes required to keep reporting clear. **Variant mutations are commonly called subvariants or offshoots** (e.g., "an Omicron subvariant"). See [**coronavirus variations**](/home/c/coronavirus#mutation) for more typographical guidance on what's known as Pango nomenclature (e.g., B.1.351 versus B.1.1.7), for background on the gradual adoption of Greek letter labels (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron), as well as for important caveats against using geographical shorthand or fanciful nicknames when identifying viruses, variants and subvariants.

See also [flu](/home/f/flu) (guidelines on H1N1 influenza, etc.), and [immunization, vaccination and inoculation](/home/i/immunization-vaccination).


**Bacteria**
Bacteria are also microorganisms that can infect other life forms. But **unlike viruses, bacteria have more options to survive because they can grow on non-living surfaces.** They're found all over Earth — in air, water, soil — as well as in a wide range of the planet's plants and animals, from large mammals to small organisms.

Not all bacteria are bad. And some have industrial applications, such as treating sewage or making yogurt. Bacteria that cause harm are referred to as **pathogens**. Numerous illnesses and diseases are caused by bacteria, including anthrax, cholera, diphtheria, listeriosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. **Antibiotics**, such as penicillin, are used to treat some bacterial infections. Germs that develop resistance to drugs are commonly called **superbugs**.


**Bacteria (singular and plural)**
The word bacterium is rarely used outside of medical and scientific communities. Instead, **bacteria has become increasingly common as both a singular and plural term**. See [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals) for details and examples.


**Viral, bacterial**
**Certain illnesses, such as meningitis, can be caused by a virus or bacteria, and should be clearly identified as such** in news stories (i.e., viral meningitis or bacterial meningitis).


**Other microbes**
**Viruses and bacteria are not the only causes of illness.** Prions, for example, are an infectious protein particle linked to [human spongiform encephalopathy](/home/c/cjd) (CJD) and [mad cow disease](/home/m/mad-cow-disease) (BSE). And people get malaria from parasites transmitted by mosquitoes.

**If you're unable to confirm whether a particular illness is caused by a virus, bacteria or other infectious agent, the general term _microbe_ is an acceptable substitute.** There are many good websites to consult when looking up details about various diseases, including: the [Public Health Agency of Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phac-aspc.gc.ca%2Findex-eng.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1sal6ZP3v1gxwi7yB2R6LB); the [Centres for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0HrZDl0m4-s6mt1A_1ztTF); and the [World Health Organization](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Ftopics%2Fen%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2muMz9ne5SczvbOEZcvX4Y).

**Germs are spread in different ways** — from airborne transmission (coughing, sneezing) to insect bites and sexual contact. Touching dirty surfaces, drinking infected water and eating contaminated food can also lead to infection. **When reporting on specific illnesses, it's helpful to include information about the method(s) of transmission as well as ways to stop the spread** (e.g., regularly and thoroughly washing hands).

### Balkans

**the Balkans**

**Ten independent countries** (as well as the small European portion of Turkey) make up this region of the world. They are **all in the Balkan Peninsula — which is bordered by the Adriatic, Aegean, Black, Ionian and Mediterranean seas:**

> [Albania](/home/b/balkans#Albania)
>
> [Bosnia-Herzegovina](/home/b/balkans#Bosnia)
>
> [Bulgaria](/home/b/balkans#Bulgaria)
>
> [Croatia](/home/b/balkans#Croatia)
>
> [Greece](/home/b/balkans#Greece)
>
> [Kosovo](/home/b/balkans#Kosovo)
>
> [Macedonia](/home/b/balkans#Macedonia)
>
> [Montenegro](/home/b/balkans#Montenegro)
>
> [Romania](/home/b/balkans#Romania)
>
> [Serbia](/home/b/balkans#Serbia)
>
> [Slovenia](/home/b/balkans#Slovenia)


**When people speak of _the Balkans_, however, they're often referring to the seven states that used to form [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia):** Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The terms **Balkan war**, **Yugoslav war** and **Yugoslavian war** are all common and acceptable names for the fighting that erupted as Yugoslavia broke up in the early 1990s (e.g., **the UN's Balkan war crimes tribunal**). Be aware, however, that there have been other Balkan wars dating back more than a century, so it's important to make sure the intended meaning is clear from context


**Albania**
Adjective: **Albanian**
People: **Albanians**
Capital: **Tirana**


**Bosnia-Herzegovina**
Although the full name is often used in first reference, **it's common and acceptable to use Bosnia only in many stories.**
Declared independence from [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) in 1992.
Adjective: **Bosnian**
People: **Bosnians**, but specify ethnicity when relevant (e.g., Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats)
Capital: **Sarajevo**


**Bulgaria**
Adjective: **Bulgarian**
People: **Bulgarians**
Capital: **Sofia**


**Croatia**
Declared independence from [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) in 1991.
Adjective: **Croatian**
People: **Croats**
Capital: **Zagreb**


**Greece**
Adjective: **Greek**
People: **Greeks**
Capital: **Athens**


**Kosovo**
A region in the south of Serbia that **unilaterally declared independence in 2008**. Canada and about 30 other countries recognized Kosovo as a separate state within about a month, but [Serbia](/home/b/balkans#Serbia) has opposed its former province from being formally admitted into the United Nations.
Adjective: **Kosovo**
People: **Kosovars**
Capital: **Pristina**
Kosovo is made up mainly of ethnic Albanians (about 90 per cent of the population). It has not been under Serbian control since NATO launched airstrikes in 1999 during a Serbian crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists. As of the summer of 2009, Kosovo also included roughly 100,000 Serbs — most of whom lived in separate areas watched over by NATO peacekeepers.
**The term "ethnic Albanian" is a conventional and acceptable way to describe Kosovo's majority**, in order to distinguish them from citizens of Albania (a neighbouring country). Citizens of Kosovo who are **ethnic Albanians** or **ethnic Serbs** can also be called **Kosovar Albanians** or **Kosovar Serbs**, respectively.


**Macedonia**
Declared independence from [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) in 1991.
The full name of this country has been disputed for decades. In the early 1990s, Macedonia tried to join the United Nations as the newly sovereign Republic of Macedonia. But Greece lodged a formal international complaint, arguing that the noun "Macedonia" on its own would cause confusion with the Greek region of Macedonia. As a result, the country was referred to as **the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia** in many circles for decades, including at the United Nations. But most news organizations, including the CBC, decided that this long, awkward (and technically unofficial) name was rarely necessary. Instead, we adopted the common approach that it was **OK to call the country "Macedonia" as long as** the details of a given story ensured that there was **no chance of confusion between this sovereign republic and a northern region of Greece** also known as Macedonia. In June 2018, an agreement was reached between Macedonia and Greece to hold a referendum on a new, official name for the country: the Republic of North Macedonia.
Adjective: **Macedonian**
People: **Macedonians**
Capital: **Skopje**


**Montenegro**
One of only two republics left after [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) was broken up during 1991-92. It shared a loosely federated country with [Serbia](/home/b/balkans#Serbia) for several years on the condition that sovereignty referendums would be held. In 2006, Montenegro and Serbia became independent countries.
Adjective: **Montenegrin**
People: **Montenegrins**
Capital: **Podgorica**


**Romania**
Adjective: **Romanian**
People: **Romanians**
Capital: **Bucharest**


**Serbia**
One of only two republics left after [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) broke up during 1991-92. It shared a loosely federated country with [Montenegro](/home/b/balkans#Montenegro) for several years on the condition that sovereignty referendums would be held. In 2006, Serbia and Montenegro became independent states. Another region, Kosovo, unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
Adjective: **Serbian**
People: **Serbs**
Capital: **Belgrade**


**Slovenia**
Declared independence from [Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia) in 1991.
Adjective: **Slovenian**
People: **Solvenes**
Capital: **Ljubljana**


**Yugoslavia**
Formerly called the "Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes," this federation of Slavic states in southeast Europe assumed the name the "Kingdom of Yugoslavia" in 1929. Its capital was Belgrade. For the next six decades, the country's territory changed slightly and it took on several other names, including: the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the Second World War, Yugoslavia became a communist federation. **It began breaking up in 1991 during violent ethnic fighting.** Four of the six members seceded: [Croatia](/home/b/balkans#Croatia), [Macedonia](/home/b/balkans#Macedonia) and [Slovenia](/home/b/balkans#Slovenia) left first during the first year, followed by [Bosnia-Herzegovina](/home/b/balkans#Bosnia) in 1992. The two remaining republics, [Serbia](/home/b/balkans#Serbia) and [Montenegro](/home/b/balkans#Montenegro), declared a new federal republic of Yugoslavia. The country changed its name to the "Union of Serbia and Montenegro" in 2003 before officially splitting into two separate states in 2006. [Kosovo](/home/b/balkans#Kosovo), in turn, unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008.

### Bank of Canada

**Bank of Canada**

It's also known as the _central bank_. The Bank of Canada is a federally owned corporation that controls the country's money supply. Among other things, it lends cash to private banks and acts as a bank for the federal government (which writes cheques, sells bonds, makes investments, etc., through the central bank).

The governor is appointed for a seven-year term and has a fair amount of independence over monetary policy, influencing the money supply by raising and lowering short-term interest rates. (See [bank rate](/home/b/bank-rate))

Canada's minister of finance, however, has the ultimate responsibility for monetary policy and can overrule the bank by issuing written instructions that must be made public.


**Mandate**
The central bank's broad legal mandate is to keep the economy sailing smoothly by moderating fluctuations in economic growth, external trade, prices, employment and so forth. But for more than a decade, it's largely focused on keeping inflation down, arguing that price stability is the key to sustained economic welfare.

The bank also looks after Canada's gold and foreign currency reserves, and can influence the value of the Canadian dollar by changing interest rates or by intervening in the foreign exchange market (buying or selling Canadian dollars).

America's central bank is called the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. The chairman is appointed by the president for a four-year term.

See also [banks](/home/b/banks)

### bank rate

**Bank rate**

The **overnight** or **benchmark bank rate is the minimum rate of interest that the Bank of Canada charges chartered banks and other customers**, such as money market dealers.

**Since it influences the cost of mortgages and other consumer loans, the rate is closely watched** and frequently reported in the news.

In stories we refer to it as the _overnight bank rate_, the _benchmark bank rate_, the _central bank's trendsetting rate_, the _Bank of Canada's key lending rate_, the _central bank's policy rate_, etc.

**It is NOT the prime rate**, which is what chartered banks charge their best customers.

**Technically, the actual "bank rate" is a slightly higher amount** that chartered banks and other financial institutions pay the Bank of Canada for longer term borrowing. Exactly how much more depends on inflation targets and other factors determined by the central bank. In recent years, the bank rate has generally been a quarter to a half of one percentage point above the overnight rate.

**For consistency, we normally report on changes in the Bank of Canada's overnight rate** (also called the trendsetting or benchmark rate). **In stories written for a wide audience, generally avoid the business jargon "basis point"** (e.g., write "half a percentage point" rather than "50 basis points"). If a sizable segment of our audience doesn't know that a "basis point" equals 1/100th of a per cent, we've failed to tell our story clearly.


**Changes in rates**
**A change in the benchmark bank rate usually signals a shift in monetary policy**. A higher rate, for example, may be an attempt to cool the economy and reduce inflation by discouraging borrowing and spending. On the other hand, it may be an attempt to prop up the Canadian dollar by wooing foreign investors with a better rate of return.

The American equivalent is the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's _discount_ rate.

### banks

**Banks**

**Capitalize the generic word “bank” when it's part of a proper noun.** Short forms rather than full corporate names are OK in first reference when widely used:

-   [**Bank of Canada**](/home/b/bank-of-canada); the **central bank**; the **bank’s policy** on interest rates
-   **Bank of Montreal** (**BMO** fine in headlines or second reference); **BMO Bank of Montreal** (legal name of Canadian banking operation, rarely necessary to use in full because generally implied); **BMO Financial Group**
-   **Bank of Nova Scotia** (legal name), but **Scotiabank** fine in first reference; **Scotiabank Group**; **ScotiaMcLeod** (retail brokerage); **Scotia Capital Inc.** (corporate investment arm)
-   **Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce** (**CIBC** fine in first reference); **CIBC Wood Gundy** (retail investment division); **CIBC World Markets Inc.** (corporate and investment banking arm)
-   **HSBC Bank Canada** (formerly Hongkong Bank of Canada), **HSBC** fine in first reference
-   **Royal Bank of Canada** (the **Royal Bank** OK in first reference; **RBC** fine in headlines or second reference); RBC is the Canadian banking arm of **RBC Financial Group**
-   **Toronto-Dominion Bank** (**TD Bank** fine in first reference); **TD Bank Financial Group** refers to TD Bank and its subsidiaries; **TD Canada Trust** (banking); **TD Waterhouse** (investing)
-   **World Bank**

Chartered banks are regulated under the Bank Act. They're supervised by the federal minister of finance. When people refer to **Canada's big banks**, they mean: **the Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, CIBC, the Royal Bank** and **TD Bank.**

### barrens

**Barren Lands**

Sometimes called the **Barren Grounds** or, in second reference, simply **the Barrens** (_both acceptable_)

It is the massive area between Hudson Bay (on the east), Great Bear and Great Slave lakes on the west, the Arctic Ocean on the north and, approximately, the 59th parallel on the south.

The **Barren Lands** are not actually barren. They're also not entirely tundra. The rolling plain has rocks, short grass, some plants, forests in the south and trees along river valleys.

### baseball

**Baseball terms**

at bat (but four at-bats), backstop, ball club, ball game, ballpark, ballplayer, baseline, bullpen, centre field, centre-fielder, centre-field fence, change-up, doubleheader, double-play, earned-run average, fastball, first baseman, fly ball, grand slam _(n.)_, grand-slam _(adj.)_ as in "a grand-slam home run," home field _(n.)_, home-field _(adj.)_ as in "home-field advantage," home plate, home run, knuckleball, left-fielder, left-hander, line up _(v.)_, lineup _(n.)_, major league _(n.)_, major-league _(adj.)_, a major-leaguer _(n.)_, no-hitter, one-hitter, etc. _(n.)_, pinch hit _(n. and v.)_, pinch-hitter _(n.)_, pinch-hit _(adj.)_ as in "pinch-hit home run," play off _(v.)_, playoff _(n., adj.)_, pop fly, pop up _(v.)_, pop-up _(adj. and n.)_, put out _(v.)_, putout _(n.)_, RBI(s), right-fielder, right-hander, shortstop, shut out _(v.)_, shutout _(n., adj.)_, split-finger fastball, triple-play, twi-night doubleheader

Prefer A, AA, AAA for minor and amateur leagues (especially in headlines). But spell out the abbreviation if it makes the context clearer (e.g., in a feature that refers only once to somebody's single-A background, which might look odd as "A"). When spelling out, conform to Canadian Press style: single-A, double-A, triple-A, double-A team, triple-A player, etc.

World Series, the Series, Little League Baseball World Series

See the [sports overview](/home/s/sports-overview) for links to various other entries, including basketball, curling, football, golf, hockey, soccer and Olympics.

### basketball

**Basketball terms**

backboard, backcourt, baseline, field goal, foul line, foul shot, free throw, free-throw line, frontcourt, full-court press, goaltending, half-court pass, halftime, in-bounds pass, jump ball, jump shot, layup, man-to-man (adj.), midcourt, play off (v.), playoff (n., adj.), three-point play, three-pointer, tip off (v.), the tip off (n.), tip-off time

Use a capital F in NBA Finals because it's treated as a proper-noun equivalent. This is an exception to our general rule about not elevating generic words like "championship" or "final" or "playoffs" in most sports (e.g., CFL championship, NHL final). While those sports have specific names for their championships (e.g., Grey Cup game, Stanley Cup final, World Series championship), the NBA does not. NOTE: In generic constructions and/or second reference, NBA Finals becomes the finals (i.e., lowercase "f" when the word finals appears on its own).

See the [sports overview](/home/s/sports-overview) for links to various other entries, including baseball, curling, football, golf, hockey, soccer and Olympics.

### battle

**Battle versus battle**

**Keep the generic word "battle" lowercase except when naming specific, historic clashes:**

_Battle of the Plains of Abraham
Battle of Britain_
They went into _battle_
It was a _battle royal_  over the defence budget
The _battles_ on the beaches at Dunkirk
Leopard 2s are classified as _battle_ [tanks](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/w/weapons/#military "Weapons")

### Begs the question

**Begs the question**

**"Begs the question" is a criticism of an argument.**

When you use this logician's expression you’re not merely saying “Hey, that raises a question” but are actually stating, **“Your conclusion is unfounded because a key premise is unproven.”**

**Do not write begs the question if all you really want to say is _raises an issue, prompts a question, invites a question, evades a question_** or anything else along those lines.

In this context, **begs** means “improperly take for granted” while the word **question** means “the issue” (as opposed to an interrogative sentence).


**Challenging a premise with 'begs the question'**
**The flaws in certain arguments are more obvious than in others.** Sometimes the problem is a case of faulty A-B-C logic. Sometimes it’s simply a loose paraphrase of an earlier, unproven point. **The common thread is that buried within a proposition is an assumption that needs as much proving as the conclusion itself.**

Here are some examples:

> _“The highways minister should resign because the new legislation is unfair to most motorists.”_


The above speaker is guilty of begging the question of the legislation’s unfairness to motorists, which must be established before it can be used as a premise.

> _“The sculpture is obviously worthless because it’s clearly no good.”_


No evidence has been presented that the sculpture is no good. The person is simply advancing a strong but unproven view.

> _“She can't be Canadian because all Canadians are polite and dull.”_


A generalization about Canadians has been wrongly taken for granted and used as the basis of a conclusion. The argument begs the question because the issue of politeness and dullness requires proof.

> _“Abortion is the intentional and unjustifiable killing of a human being and as such is murder. Murder is illegal. So abortion should be illegal.”_


This argument begs the question about abortion being categorized as murder. The conclusion, that abortion should be illegal, is founded on the statement that abortion is murder. This may be a belief held by many, but it's not an incontrovertible fact. Proof is required that abortion is murder before the rest of the points can be considered.


**But English evolves**

> _English changes over time, and all evolution of language is good. So it’s wrong to insist that people use begs the question in a specific way._


But **the above argument begs the question** about the inherent goodness of all language evolution. **The argument also raises the question:** Does retaining the original meanings of some English words and phrases make communicating more effective?

Begs the question has its origins in the expression _petitio principii_, Latin for petitioning (or laying claim) to a principle. Although many people now use begs the question in other ways, these broader meanings remain disputed.
**Most authorities recommend sticking with the original definition.** Here, for instance, is advice from the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage:


> "In Canadian newspapers, 'begs the question' almost always means 'raises the question' or 'brings up the issue.' Although this usage is very common, it should probably be avoided because it is completely at odds with the formal meaning of the expression and constantly criticized by commentators."


**CBC News style is to preserve the original meaning of this expression.** (The same stand has been taken by numerous other news organizations, including CP, the Globe and Mail, and the New York Times.)

Misusing "begs the question" irks some readers, listeners and viewers, and has the potential to leave others confused. It also impoverishes the language by taking a highly specific term and turning it into a synonym for familiar phrases that already serve us well, such as "raises the question" or "prompts the question."

**If you're not 100 per cent certain what premise you're challenging when you write "begs the question," you're probably using the phrase in a disputable way and should pick other wording.**

### bi

**Biannual, biennial, bimonthly, biweekly**

The prefix “bi” can be ambiguous. _Bimonthly_, for instance, can mean every two months or twice a month.

Although _“biannual”_ suggests twice a year and _“biennial”_ implies once every two years, not everyone knows this.

Even fewer are aware that _“sesquicentennial”_ means every 150 years. So what’s the point of tossing around Latin that needs to be explained?

**Unless the meaning is obvious, avoid these labels. _Write specific descriptions instead:_** _twice a year, every two years, twice a month, every two weeks,_ etc.

### bishop

**Bishop versus bishop**

**Capitalize the generic word “bishop” before a name or when a full title is used.
Do not abbreviate.**

_Bishop John Anderson
Bishop of London
the bishop’s_ request

### blackface\_brownface

**Blackface, brownface, etc.**


**Overview**

The term blackface, coined in the 1700s, was originally a pejorative label for people with dark skin. By the 1800s, it became synonymous with mocking impersonations of Black people, especially by white performers in minstrel shows in the United States. Such shows featured exaggerated mannerisms and offensive ridicule that perpetuated hurtful stereotypes.

Today, **blackface commonly means use of makeup, polish, paint, etc., to look like a Black person**, regardless of whether wigs, costumes, etc., are also worn. But **blackface is not an umbrella term for the impersonation of other skin colours**. Instead, **there are specific variations** from the original noun's stem, including:

-   **brownface** (to try to appear to be from Latin America, the Middle East or South Asia)
-   **redface** (to try to appear to be an Indigenous person in North America,)
-   **yellowface** (to try to appear to be from Asia)
-   **whiteface** (to try to appear Caucasian)

**Use the term that's most applicable.** Saying that someone wearing brownface is in "blackface" is as inaccurate as saying that someone from Saudi Arabia is African American.

The word **brownface is relatively common** and, so, generally doesn't require defining as long as the context makes the meaning clear. **But "redface" and "yellowface" are comparatively obscure and can be jarring to read or hear unless defined**.


> _Al Jolson became the face of 20th century **blackface** in the 1927 film, The Jazz Singer.
> Peter Sellers wore **brownface**, not blackface, portraying an Indian in the 1968 film, The Party.
> Grey Owl personifies "**redface"** — a variation of blackface — because he spent years pretending to be an Indigenous person.
> The term **"yellowface"** refers to impersonating someone Asian, such as Mickey Rooney in the 1961 film. Breakfast at Tiffany's._


**Another option is to use a description rather than a largely unfamiliar label** like "redface" or "yellowface." For instance:


> _In the 1930s, British-born Archibald Belaney used makeup as well as bald-faced lies to trick people into thinking he was an Indigenous conservationist in Canada. **In addition to calling himself Grey Owl** and adopting fake speech patterns, **he dyed his hair black and secretly coloured his skin with henna.**_




NOTE: For a powerful comment on the racist use of Indigenous costumes and face paint, watch Halifax writer Rebecca Thomas read her **2016 poem [_RedFace_](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fnova-scotia%2Fwar-paint-tribe-called-red-poet-laureate-rebecca-thomas-1.3732134&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0zlemR_kypCaroVKs4COVP).**



Bear in mind that when looking at old images — especially black-and-white photos — **it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a person is in blackface, brownface, etc.** Contrast levels can be distorted and misleading. In these cases, consider other information (e.g., a party's theme, the individual's costume, witness accounts) and use common sense.

While brownface, redface and yellowface are acceptable terms for specific racial impersonations, **avoid calling people "brown," "red," yellow," etc., unless attributed** (i.e., in broadcast clips and directly transcribed quotes). **Even then, be aware such words can be highly offensive.** On the other hand, **"Black" and "white" are entrenched and OK** because they're considered familiar, fact-based descriptions.



**Indisputably racist**

**Donning blackface, brownface, etc., is unequivocally [racist](/home/r/racial-terms#racist-racism)** [](/home/r/racial-terms)— regardless of how common it once was. (Slavery and racial segregation were also once common.) **Appearing in whiteface, however, is not automatically considered racist** because white people do not share the same history of oppression and discrimination as non-white people in Europe and North America. **Whiteface can, however, still be racist in some circumstances** (e.g., in countries where white people are in the minority). And, of course, someone in whiteface may say or do things that are, themselves, racist, irrespective of the makeup.

Whenever practical, **include the voices of people who are not white in reports on blackface, brownface, etc., to help explain the deep pain caused by such racism**. Some people may wrongly assume that the racism threshold is whether caricatures are overtly clownish. But **the makeup and costumes should be assessed from an informed perspective**. For instance, a white person may see blackface as cringeworthy and inappropriate, but a Black person may liken it to witnessing the flaunting privilege of someone who can temporarily change skin colour without actually experiencing the daily anguish of bigotry and discrimination.

**Context can be relevant, including when and where someone appeared in racist facial makeup** (e.g., 30 years ago while trick-or-treating as a teenager, or two years ago at an office party). Societal norms and values evolve over time. **But never frame explanatory context as an actual excuse for blackface, brownface, etc.** This includes being careful when reporting people's own ignorance about what is or is not racist. Put another way: It's insufficient to attribute bogus claims (e.g., that painting one's face is harmless humour, or a heartfelt way of honouring people born with that skin colour). Instead, **it's crucial to make clear in stories that blackface, brownface, etc., are considered unacceptable** in modern Canadian society.

**Distinguish between [true apologies](/home/a#apology) and mere expressions of regret** when reporting on the fallout from scandals involving public figures. For instance, despite being criticized for his outlandish, highly offensive portrayal of the Asian landlord I. Y. Yuniosh in _Breakfast at Tiffany's_, actor Mickey Rooney staunchly defended his role for decades. Then in 2008, a few years before his death, Rooney said he wouldn't have played the part had he known so many people would be offended by it — an expression of regret about a career choice but not an apology for being in "yellowface."

**Define new or obscure words that may cause confusion in stories.** In the entertainment industry, **for instance, "whitewashing" now has a few meanings.** The word sometimes refers to casting white actors, or actors with indeterminate racial features, in non-white roles. Whitewashing also means hiring white actors, directors, cinematographers, etc., over equally qualified people from diverse racial backgrounds. Both practices can be signs of pervasive, systematic racism.

See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

### boat versus ship

**Boat versus ship**

Ships are bigger than boats. Although there are no clearcut definitions to follow, some general guidelines may keep you out of hot water.

**The term "boat" is normally applied to smaller craft**, especially those used on inland waterways (streams, lakes, etc.) as well as in coastal areas. This category includes _fishing boats_ and most pleasure craft, such as small _sailboats_.

**A ship is a larger sea-going vessel.** The big ones that carry a lot of people on long voyages are called ocean _liners_ or _passenger liners_. Those that carry primarily freight, especially containers or crates loaded by cranes, are known as _cargo ships, freight ships_ or _container ships_. Those that carry oil in bulk are called _oil tankers_ or _tankers_.

**The generic word "vessel" can apply to a ship as well as to most boats** (i.e., those bigger than, say, a rowboat or dinghy).

**The word "craft" applies to boats and ships.** It's already _plural_, so don't refer to crafts. (See [plurals](/home/p/plurals))

**A life-raft usually describes an inflatable flatboat** that looks more like a big air mattress with low sides (i.e., like a "raft") than a traditionally shaped dory, pram, dinghy, rowboat, etc. **A lifeboat, by contrast, is generally a sturdier craft, often made of wood, that has the more traditional appearance of a small boat.** Technically, of course, a raft could be made of, say, timber and a dinghy could be inflatable. So there's overlap between the labels. Careful writers, however, avoid using the terms interchangeably. Covered life-rafts look a bit like floating tents.

**If you're certain that a vessel falls into a specific category (e.g., _yacht_, _schooner_, etc.) using that word in second reference can add colour.** In sailing, a craft should have at least three masts with square-rigged sails on each (fore, main and mizzen) to be accurately called a ship. But using such criteria quickly becomes overly technical. Some people, for instance, argue that the Bluenose II is a two-masted fishing schooner while the government of Nova Scotia calls it a ship. In this case, craft, vessel and schooner are uncontroversial choices.

**An [armada](/home/a#armada) refers to a fleet of warships.** Avoid applying it to boats and small ships that are unarmed. Use a term such as **flotilla**, instead.


**Common mistakes**
In news stories, the three errors that bob up the most are: (1) _referring to fishing boats as ships;_ (2) _describing a group of fishing trawlers or other unarmed vessels as an armada;_ and (3) _calling military ships_ (e.g., frigates and destroyers) boats. **Submarines, however, are classified as boats and should not be called ships.**

**Use the pronoun it** (possessive its) **for all inanimate objects, including ships**, planes, cars, guns, etc. See [problems with pronouns](/home/p/problems-with-pronouns) for related guidelines.

See also [HMCS](/home/h/hmcs).

### Both


**Both**

The word can be an adjective (both sides), an adverb (both now and evermore) and a pronoun (both laughed). It can also be annoyingly redundant and prompt complaints.

**To keep your writing tight almost always delete "both" when the word is already implied.** For instance:

> "**They decided to leave**" NOT "They _both_ decided to leave."
>
> "**They collided**" NOT "They _both_ collided."
>
> "**They have different ideas**" NOT "They _both_ have different ideas."
>
> "**His parents agreed**" NOT " _Both_ of his parents agreed."

**
Sometimes, "both" can be left in if it helps emphasize a particular point:**

> "**His parents showed up**" simply states a fact, as in "The phone rang, the door opened, his parents showed up."
>
> "**Both parents showed up**" underscores that both adults were there, especially if one person's attendance had been in doubt.


**When using "both" for emphasis, however, steer clear of obvious redundancy:**

> "**They were at odds with the dean**" (preferred)
>
> "**They were both at odds with the dean**" (OK if this emphasis helps the storytelling, as in "They were both at odds with the dean, but only one of them was prepared to file a formal complaint").

> "They were _both_ at odds with each other" (wrong; always redundant) Make it: "**They were at odds**" or "**They were at odds with each other**," if the conversational and acceptable idiom "with each other" helpfully highlights they were not at odds with a third person.

### Boulevard

**Boulevard versus boulevard**

**Capitalize when used in a proper name.**

**Abbreviate in numbered street addresses.**

### boycott

**Boycott**

The term has **a couple of entrenched meanings** tied to protest:


> **1\. To stop buying/consuming** (e.g., a product boycott); **to cease commercial support/transactions** (e.g., a trade boycott).
>
> **2\. To refuse to attend** (e.g., a ceremony, a meeting, a sporting event, as in an Olympics boycott).


In the case of professional sports, **be aware that some people object to the term boycott to describe a walkout**. They insist that the correct word is "strike," **even though a strike by farm workers was actually a central part of the first protest that led to the term boycott being coined** more than a century ago.

**It's a myth that "boycott" narrowly applies only to consumers punishing businesses**. The word was born in Ireland in the 1880s during a dispute between tenants and an aristocrat's land agent named Charles Boycott. To protest what were considered unfair rental hikes and evictions, activists came up with ways to ostracize him — from persuading Boycott's employees to stop working (letting crops spoil in the fields) to encouraging local shops and other businesses to refuse to serve him. **In a nutshell, the original boycott was a combination of the withdrawal of labour** (a "strike") **and a suspension of commerce.**

The eponym became so well known, it turned into a lowercase verb and noun ("to boycott" and "to join a boycott") within a generation. **Although the word now commonly means an organized campaign to stop buying specific goods and/or services, it's also been used to describe "a refusal to ... participate in a particular event" since at least the 1980s**, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.

**Boycott, strike, walkout**
**Sometimes it's crucial to recognize denotative differences between words**. For example, we distinguish between [strikes and lockouts](/home/s#strike) to keep our journalism accurate.

**At other times, however, more than one term applies.**


> EXAMPLE: **In late August 2020, a debate erupted over what to call a protest by hundreds of professional athletes in different sports in North America** (basketball, baseball and hockey). **They stopped playing after another police shooting of a Black man in the U.S.** NBA players, who led the walkout, called it a "boycott" to raise public awareness about racial injustice. But **the term boycott was challenged by some who insisted that it was actually a "strike."** The protest expanded to other sports, including Major League Baseball. But **then the suitability of both "boycott" and "strike" was questioned when the NHL decided to postpone some scheduled games on its own** — essentially eliminating the need for hockey players to decide whether they wanted to sit out or lace up. To further muddy matters, **some media outlets began asking experts in sports and labour law to weigh in on the differences between "boycotts" and "strikes,"** as if common usage depended on legal dictionaries. More than a few lawyers defined "boycott" in very limited and dubious ways (e.g., to starve a business of revenue). Others introduced peripheral complexities (e.g., professional basketball players can "strike" because they're part of a union but professional golfers can't because they're independent contractors). There were also plenty of suggestions to add modifiers (e.g, a "wildcat" strike, a "political" strike), as if putting extra words in front of a contested noun magically settled the debate over that noun. At the end of the day, **anyone in search of categorical direction may well have found the back-and-forths over language as pointless as the final 0-0 score of a game not played.**


**In cases like this, the best way to serve our audience is to ensure that key detail is included.** We should strive to provide answers to rudimentary questions, such as: Are professional athletes refusing to participate in an entire tournament or in just one or two games? What is the objective? To get team owners or tournament organizers to do something? To raise public awareness about something not directly tied to the sport or to the competition? What terminology is being used by the athletes? Strike? Boycott? Are players the only ones participating? How about coaches? What's the position of team owners? The league?

**We also need to accept that there's often no single, convenient noun or verb to turn to.** Most options are imperfect in different ways. For instance:


> **Protest** is accurate but generic and vague. Showing up late or refusing to wear a team jersey are also protests.
>
> **Strike** correctly describes withdrawal of paid labour, but it can also wrongly telegraph a contract dispute, and it's inapt for league-ordered stoppages.
>
> **Boycott** is OK based on convention, but it can peeve people who think it means withholding patronage, and it's also inapt for league-ordered stoppages.
>
> **Walkout** is a fact-based description, but in the middle of a public health crisis like 2020's pandemic it might also suggest a physical exit from the confines of a "bubble" tournament.


**Use common sense and supply context.** For example: **"Walkout" is fine** as long as a story is about a player-led protest, and we make it clear if they intend to resume. **"Boycott" is OK** as long as it refers to an athlete-led protest and not to league-imposed postponements. **"Strike" is fine** for player walkouts, too, **although it's arguably more problematic, especially in headlines**, because of its close association with contract disputes rather than with political causes. This is in stark contrast to, say, a [student strike](/home/s#studentstrike), which is a common and instantly understood description of a protest that's got nothing to do with industrial relations.

The reality is that **it's not automatically wrong to use these words interchangeably in certain coverage**, depending on specific facts. This is **particularly true of generic terms** like "protest" and "stoppage." **In the case of more specific words** (e.g., "boycott" and "strike"), **it's usually best to stick to one within a given broadcast or online story**, outside of attribution (i.e., in a clip or transcribed quote).

### Britain

**Britain**

The noun **Britain refers to one island: England, Scotland and Wales.** It used to be called Great Britain to distinguish it from Brittany.

**"Britain" is generally acceptable as a synonym for "United Kingdom"** (e.g., _"Britain is expected to use its veto when the UN Security Council votes" or "Britain decided to join the war"_), except in stories focused on Northern Ireland. **"British" is the preferred adjective in most cases** (e.g., "the British government" rather than "the United Kingdom government").

**Avoid the words Britain or British when referring to Northern Ireland. Instead, use "United Kingdom" or "U.K."** (The U.K. consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.) This is particularly important in stories involving disputes over Northern Ireland.

**Briton** is the word to describe **a citizen of Britain**. The plural is **Britons**. Avoid the term _Britisher_. Be careful to avoid embarrassing mistakes like "Britains go to the polls on Monday." Make it _Britons_ or _British citizens_.

### Bulleted list

**Bulleted lists**

Bulleted lists are a slick, effective way to convey information in web stories. But when these are added to the main text of stories **you must follow a few basic rules, including:**

-   Consistent punctuation.


-   Parallel construction.


-   Proper HTML code (normally automatic when using CBC publishing tools).

A more relaxed approach can be used within graphics, which are not formally presenting such lists as part of extended sentences or paragraphs.


**Punctuation**
**Introduce lists with a full colon and include punctuation between the bullets.**

**Each point should begin with a capital letter and end with a period**, even if it contains only one word. This punctuation always applies.
**
Leave a space between each entry. Do _not_ use semicolons.**

Periods are not required if the bulleted lists are featured inside stand-alone graphics.

**Parallel construction**
**All points in a list should flow logically from the introductory statement.**

**And all the entries should meet a single syntax test.** In other words, the same grammatical structure and tense should be used throughout.


**Example 1**

_When typing bulleted lists you should:
_

-   _Begin each point with a capital letter.
    _
-   _End each point with a period.
    _
-   _Use parallel construction.
    _
-   _Always leave a space between lines._

**Example 2**

_The report contains several recommendations, including:
_

-   _Fewer trade barriers._ 
-   _Lower taxes.
    _
-   _Higher salaries for editors._

**Example 3**

__The committee recommends:
__

-   _Reducing trade barriers.
    _
-   _Lowering taxes.
    _
-   _Giving editors a raise._

**Wrong (not parallel)**

_The report recommends:
_

-   _Reducing trade barriers.
    _
-   _Tax cuts.
    _
-   _Raise for editors._

**The last example is flawed because the syntax is incoherent.** It does not make sense to write: “The report recommends reducing trade barriers, tax cuts, and raise for editors.”


**Why no semicolons?**
We’ve tried various versions of bulleted lists on our site over the years. Some people, for instance, prefer semicolons after each point until reaching a final period. But many copy editors in North America dislike this style because it technically requires a conjunction (i.e., _and_) before the last entry.

The more streamlined approach adopted by CBCNews.ca is also used by many other organizations, including the Washington Post.

**canister**

**CanLit** (_informal_ for Canadian literature; OK in headlines or directly transcribed quotes)

**cannabis** (see [**marijuana**](/home/m#marijuana))

**cannon** (weapon) **cannonball, cannon fodder**, etc. Traditionally, cannon is also the plural form (e.g., **water cannon, snow cannon**). But the term "cannons" has become increasingly common and is now considered acceptable (e.g., a ship's cannons). Compare with [canon](/home/c#canon) below.

**canon** (general rule, law, principle or criterion) In religious contexts, canon often means a church decree or sanction. The word is also commonly used to refer to a collection of writing considered important (e.g., the literary canon). Compare with [cannon](/home/c#cannon) above.

**canoeist**

**cantaloupe**

**canto, cantos**

**Cantonese** (a variety of language spoken by tens of millions in China, especially in Guangdong and the southern Guangxi province, as well as in cities like Macao and Hong Kong) It's distinct from **Mandarin**, which is the dominant and official spoken language of roughly a billion people in mainland China, as well as by residents of Taiwan. When pertinent, it can be helpful to use a modifier to differentiate dialects (e.g., **Malaysian Cantonese**), in the same way we might refer to, say, Lebanese Arabic. See also **[Chinese language](#Chinese-language)** for related guidelines.

**Canuck**

**canvas, canvases** (cloth, painting)

**canvass** (v., ask for opinions, seek votes, etc.; n., process of canvassing)

**Canwest Global Communications** (Note the lowercase "w," adopted in January 2008) **Canwest** is fine in headlines and second reference.

**canyon, Grand Canyon**

**cap-and-trade, cap-and-trade emissions** (hyphen for n. and adj.)

**Cape Breton Island;** also, **Cape Breton, N.S.** (as in "off the coast of Cape Breton, N.S."); but **Sydney, N.S.**, not "Sydney, Cape Breton"

**Cape Spear, N.L.** (the most easterly point in North America)

**Cape Town** (two words)

**Cape Verde** (not "Cabo Verde") Always use conventional English versions of foreign countries' names, such as Ivory Coast instead of "République de Côte d'Ivoire." See [**country names**](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld)

[**capitalization**](/home/c/capitalization) (an overview)

**cappuccino, cappuccinos**

**captain**, a captain of industry, **Capt. John Stone** (abbreviated for [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks) and comparable corps titles before names, including senior firefighters, U.S. police precinct and divisional leaders, and Salvation Army officers); **Air Canada Captain Michael McKay** (spelled-out with a capital "C" before names of pilots with this command designation); lowercase captain in virtually all other cases, including captains of sports teams and watercraft (e.g., Maple Leafs **captain Darryl Sittler**, tugboat **captain Sarah Smith**, South Korean ferry **captain Lee Joon-seok**).

**CAQ** (OK in headlines, or in second reference to [Coalition Avenir Québec](/home/c#CAQ))

**carat** (gems); **karat** (gold); **caret** (the printer's mark ^, representing a proposed insert)

**carbon dioxide** (**CO2** is fine in headlines and second reference); **carbon monoxide** (**CO** is fine in headlines and second reference, such as a **CO detector**) See [chemical names](/home/c/chemical-names) for general guidelines.

**[carbon pricing, carbon tax](/home/c/carbon_tax_levy)**

**carburetor**

**cardholder** (one word)

**card key** (two words) See [key card](/home/k#keycard)

**cardinal, College of Cardinals, Cardinal Gérald Lacroix** (no abbreviation); in second reference, make it: _the cardinal said_ or _Cardinal Lacroix said._ Avoid putting the word Cardinal between the person's given name and surname (e.g., Albino Cardinal Luciani). This archaic custom was originally based on nobility titles (e.g., _Richard, Duke of York_). Catholic Church authorities no longer follow this practice, except in some very formal documents. This is why most major media outlets now always put the title Cardinal first, including CBC News. (Note: Style manuals from the Globe and Mail, the New York Times and Associated Press have all updated their entries on Cardinal in recent years. The Canadian Press was one of the last news services to abandon the old style, around 2016.) See also [Archbishop versus archbishop](/home/a#archbishop). Since some retired cardinals can still actively participate in certain church duties (e.g., the selection of a new Pope if the retiree is under 80), retain a capital C in their titles: retired Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte. This is an exception to our normal style (e.g., retired general John de Chastelain). See [titles](/home/t/titles) for details. Church officials often talk about cardinals being "**created**." But it's an odd verb that can be jarring in scripts. In many cases, more conversational alternatives are preferred, such as: **named** cardinal, **appointed** cardinal, **installed** as cardinal, **promoted** to cardinal, **elevated** to cardinal or even **made a cardinal** — especially when lists of new appointees are first released, as well as later on, when biographical detail is being added to stories. For instance, we'd normally write that Marc Ouellet "became a cardinal in 2003" rather than "was created cardinal in 2003." However, it's OK to use the verb "create," too, especially when covering the specific public ceremony. This normally takes place at what's called a "consistory," where the reading of a papal decree "creates" the cardinal, according to an English translation of the Roman Catholic Church's Code of Canon Law.

**CARE** (unnecessary to spell out: Co-operative for American Relief Everywhere Inc.) Specify **CARE Canada** in first reference when relevant to the story, such as "the CARE Canada office" or "a CARE Canada program." CARE alone is always fine in second reference.

**caregiver**

**cargo, cargoes**

**Caribbean Free Trade Area** (avoid abbreviation Carifta)

**Cariboo Mountains** (B.C.)

**Caribou Mountains** (Alta.)

**caribou** (deer), **Caribou Inuit, Caribou plane**

**carry over** (v.); **carryover** (n. and adj.), as in: "Carry over the amount" but "Calculate the carryover" and "It's a carryover expense"

**cartilage**

**cassette, videocassette**

**casualty, casualties** (_requires caution_) For hundreds of years, the word casualty has meant **someone injured** as well as **someone killed.** Since such vagueness can be a major source of confusion in journalism, the recommended practice is to use more precise language. Terms like hurt, wounded, deaths and fatalities are options, depending on a story's known facts. When authorities use the noun "casualties" during breaking news coverage, it's crucial to press for specifics to avoid ambiguity. (See also [mass shooting](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mass-shooting/ "Mass shooting") for details about the label "**mass casualty event**.")

**catalogue** (_not_ catalog)

**Catalonia** (semi-autonomous region of northeastern Spain); **Catalonian** (adj.) Formal description, as in Catalonian independence; **Catalan** (adj.) Common, informal description, as in Catalan leaders, Catalan separatists. Although it's generally OK to use either modifier, the shorter version (Catalan) has become increasingly popular.**Catalan/Catalonian** (n.) Both words are also interchangeable as nouns to describe residents (e.g., "Many **Catalans** say they're angry over the court's decision" and "**Catalonians** rallied in Barcelona Sunday to protest against the regional government's push for secession from Spain"). For consistency, pick one form throughout a given story. **Catalan** is also the name of the language.

**catch-all** (hyphen) All inclusive; extremely broad (e.g., "a catch-all category")

**catch-22** (a dilemma with no escape); **_Catch-22_** (Joseph Heller's book) See also [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics)

**Catholic, Catholicism** (see when to add [Roman](/home/c/catholic-roman))

**CAT scan** (no need to spell out as _computerized axial tomography_) Prefer the term **CT scan** unless you're writing about the older technology. See [CT and CAT scans](/home/c/ct-and-cat-scans)

**cattle** (a generic term for cows, bulls, heifers and steers) The phrase "a herd of cows" implies female bovines only. Prefer "a herd of cattle." See [cattle](/home/c/cattle) for details.

**Caucasian**

**_caveat emptor_** (see [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics))

**cave in** (v.), **cave-in** (n.)

**CBS** (acceptable in all references to the Columbia Broadcasting System); **CBS's**, as in "CBS's coverage" (See also [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe))

**CCF** (fine in first reference to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation)

**Cdn** ($1,200 Cdn) use to specify Canadian currency when necessary. Put after the dollar amount. Include a space, and no period in this case. See [money](/home/m/money) for detailed guidelines.

**CD-ROM** (compact disc read-only memory); abbreviation acceptable in all references

**[c-cd](/home/c#c) \-** **[ce-cl](/home/c#ce)** **\-** **[co-cz](/home/c#co)** **\-** **[bottom](/home/c#bottom)**

**ce-cl**

**cease fire** (v.), **ceasefire** (n.)

**cease trade** (v.), **cease-trade order** (adj.)

**Celanese** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for acetate, nylon, polyester, rayon)

**a cellblock** (in jail), but **Cell Block 5** (See also [numbers](/))

**cellophane, celluloid, cellulose**

**cellphone** (a cellular phone)

**Celsius** should be abbreviated when temperatures are reported. Put a space between the C and the figure: **25 C**. If you drop C, you must add the word "degrees," since the space before the capital letter represents an invisible degree symbol: **25 degrees**. When C is dropped, Celsius is generally implied. Use an [en dash](/handy-links/punctuation/dash) for the minus sign instead of a hyphen: –30 C or –30 degrees. (See also [temperatures](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/metric-versus-imperial/#temperatures "Metric versus imperial") for rules about when to spell out figures, etc.)

**cement** (powder) Cement is _not concrete_. It's a binding agent used to make concrete, which also contains sand, crushed rock, etc. So refer to concrete floors, concrete blocks, etc.

**cemetery, Memorial Garden Cemetery**

**census, censuses, census day**

**the Centennial Year, the Centennial** (1967) _but_ **Canada's centennial**, a country's **centennial celebrations**

**Centers for Disease Control** (OK in first reference; unnecessary to write out full name as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Add adjective U.S. when necessary to point out it's an American organization: **U.S. Centers for Disease Control**. Note that "Centers" is plural and spelled "er" in this proper noun. (See [Centre versus Center](/home/c/centre-versus-center))

**centimetre** (the metric symbol cm is singular and plural; no period) See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial)

**central** (for generic geographic descriptions), as in central Afghanistan, central Alberta; **Central** (for specific reference to well-established geographic nouns), as in **Central America, Central Asia,** etc., including **Central Canada** (Ontario and Quebec) See also [Canada](/home/c#Canada) for other regional labels

**Central African Republic** (independent, landlocked country between Cameroon and [South Sudan](/home/s#SouthSudan)) Technically, "the" is not required before its name, along the lines of [Congo](/home/c/Congos) instead of "the Congo." But because the word Republic is part of the compound proper noun, a lowercase definite article is common and acceptable (i.e., the Central African Republic). See also [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the)

**Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec** (Quebec teachers federation)

**central time (CT), central standard time (CST)** See [time](/home/t/time)

**centre, centred, centring**

centre around (_avoid_) See [centre on](/home/a#centreon) below

**centre on** (not around) A centre is a point, and central points don't orbit. So make it "centre on" or "[revolve around](/home/r#revolvearound)." The fact that "centre around" has become increasingly common over the years is irrelevant. The term remains disputed and non-standard English. For this reason, "centre on" is the CBC News preference.

**centre field** (see [baseball terms](/home/b/baseball)), _but_ **centre-fielder** and **centre-field wall**

**centurion** (Roman soldier), **Centurion** (tank)

**century, 15th century**, _but_ **20th Century Fox** (proper noun); **second-century Rome, 1800s** (See also [decades](/home/t/time#1950s): 1998-2001)

**CEO** (fine in first reference for chief executive officer)

**[CERB](/home/c#CERB)**

**CERN** (OK in headlines, but define in first reference after that) There's no need to spell out as "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire." Instead, provide context in English, such as: "He worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known by the French acronym CERN." Continue to use CERN throughout story because it's more familiar than the English equivalent. See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines.

**CEW** (conducted electrical weapon, also known as a **stun gun**) Generally avoid the abbreviation CEW unless explaining a quote or clip. Use "electrical" instead of "energy" when spelling out the jargon. See [**Taser**](/home/t#Taser)

**CFB** (Canadian Forces Base) See [Canadian Forces](/home/c#CanadianForces) above, as well as [military forces](/home/m/military-forces)

**CFCs** (chlorofluorocarbons)

**CFIA** (see [Canadian Food Inspection Agency](/home/c#CFIA))

**CF-18** (Canadian designation for the McDonnell Douglas aircraft) See [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names)

**chain migration** (generally avoid) The term “chain migration” broadly refers to migrants moving from one country to another, or from one city to another, based largely on where people they know already live — especially relatives. Coined decades ago by demographers studying migration patterns, the jargon remains unfamiliar to most of our audience. It’s also become politicized in recent years by critics of immigration tied to family connections. The word “chain” in this context is muddying at best and dehumanizing at worst. So **to keep our journalism clear and neutral, prefer more descriptive language** (e.g., **family sponsorship**, **family-sponsored immigration**, **family reunification policies**). When “chain migration” is used in a story (e.g., in a transcribed clip), prefer quotation marks and be sure to define/explain the label.

**challenged** (_avoid_ as a synonym for impaired or disabled) See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#challenged)

**chamber, upper chamber, Regina Chamber of Commerce, the chamber of commerce**

**Champs-Élysées** (OK shorthand for **Avenue des Champs-Élysées**) Be aware that the spelling is slightly different for **Élysée Palace**, the official residence of France's president. (See also [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for general guidelines)

**change-maker** (hyphen)

**changeover** (n.), **change over** (v.)

**Charles III, King** (ascended to throne after death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022) See [**royal titles**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-titles/ "Royal titles") for detailed guidelines (e.g., Why specifying **"III" is optional**, and why **the King** is capitalized even when the regnal name of Canada's monarch is not used). NOTE: The possessive of Charles is **Charles's**, as in "Charles's reign."

**charley horse**

**Charlottetown accord**

**Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Charter, Charter rights** (capitalized when referring to a core part of Canada's Constitution); otherwise lowercase (a **bank's charter**, **the charter**, a **chartered boat**) unless part of a formal name (the new [**Veterans Charter**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/v/#VeteransCharter "V"))

**ChatGPT** (an [artificial intelligence](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/#AI "A") chatbot) The web-based tool was released in November 2022 by **OpenAI**, a private, California-based research company. GPT stands for "generative pre-trained transformers," but this jargon doesn't need to be spelled out in stories. ChatGPT is designed to mimic the way people write based on the structure of a massive database of books, magazines and other online text. Users can ask ChapGPT to answer questions or to write a wide range of new material, including essays, letters, document summaries, stories, poems, music, etc., as well as computer code. It does this by making a series of predictions about word and character order, along the lines of how a spellchecker makes predictions about suitable diction, grammar, syntax and punctuation. Although ChatGPT can often produce text that appears to be written by human beings, critics warn that it and other similar artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can frequently generate passages that contain factual errors.

**chat room**

**Chechnya** (n.) A Russian republic, bordering Georgia. Also known as the **Chechen Republic**, although the name Chechnya is more common in news coverage. Its capital is Grozny. **Chechen** (n., and adj.) The name of Chechnya's citizens. Also the preferred adjective (e.g., Chechen leaders, Chechen rebels).

**child care** (n.), **child-care** (adj.), as in child-care fees, child-care services, etc. "They must now pay extra for child care" but "The report proposed mandatory training for child-care workers." By comparison, [daycare](/home/d#daycare) is fused.

[**child prostitute**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/child_prostitution/ "Child_prostitution") (_avoid_), **child sex trafficking**

**Child Soldiers Initiative** (founded by Roméo Dallaire; based at Dalhousie University) In second reference, prefer either **Child Soldiers** (capitalized) or the **initiative** (generic, lowercase) instead of the initials "CSI," which are commonly associated with another abbreviation.

**childish** (silly, immature); **childlike** (innocent, trusting)

**Children's Aid Society**

**chili, chilies,** as in chili con carne, chili sauce, etc.

**china** (crockery)

**China, People's Republic of** (_mainland_, but prefer simply **China**)

**Chinese language** (often abridged as **Chinese**) Acceptable umbrella term in generic references to written or spoken forms of what linguists call the Sino-Tibetan language of China (e.g., "_They learned Chinese at home_"). But in certain stories, it's better to be precise when (i) the specific name of the language or dialect is known (e.g., **Mandarin, [Cantonese](#Cantonese), Shanghainese, Hakka**, etc.), and (ii) this detail is considered relevant to the report. **The official spoken language of China is standard Mandarin**, also known as Putonghua. Be aware that written Chinese is not based on an alphabet but, rather, on thousands of distinct glyphs. For this reason, it's misleading to describe someone "writing" Mandarin, Cantonese, etc.. Instead, the convention is to say that they are writing in Chinese. The two most common logographic systems are "traditional" and "simplified" Chinese characters.

**Chinese names** (see **[Asian names](/home/a/asian-names)**)

**Chinese New Year** (generally prefer the generic name [**Lunar New Year**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/lunar-new-year/ "Lunar New Year") in first reference, except  in stories specifically focused on the Chinese community.

**Chinook** (a West Cast [Indigenous people](/home/i/Indigenous) and their language); **Chinook helicopter**; but [**chinook**](/home/w/weather-words#chinook) wind (lowercase), and [**chinook salmon**](/home/a/animals)

**Chrétien, Jean**

**Christie's** (auctioneer)

**Christian Peacemaker Teams** (A North American-based pacifist group made up of members from various Christian faiths who send observers into trouble spots around the world in an effort to reduce violence) Although the ecumenical group is made up of Christians, its members say they are not missionaries. They describe themselves as "witnesses" who gather facts and lobby governments and other organizations to stop conflicts and improve humans rights. In news stories, it's accurate to call them **peace activists** when they organize or participate in protests, blockades, etc.

**Christmas Day, Christmas Eve** (see [holidays](/home/h/holidays) for general guidelines)

**chromosome**

**chronic fatigue syndrome** (see **[myalgic encephalomyelitis](/home/m#ME-CFS)**)

Halifax **Chronicle Herald** (no hyphen; the paper dropped it in February 2004)

Church of Christ, Scientist (**Christian Science Church** acceptable in first reference)

**Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints** (formal name; note the hyphen and lowercase word "day") While the **Mormon Church** or **the [Mormons](/home/m/mormon-mormonism)** are acceptable in first reference, include the full name at least once in stories.

**cigarette** (_not_ cigaret)

**cipher** (_not_ cypher)

**Circle, Arctic** (See [Arctic](/home/a/arctic))

**Cirque du Soleil** (prefer "English" capitalization of principal words in this noun, based on established convention) See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for related guidelines

[**cities around the world**](/home/g/geography-cities) (spellings, when to include country's name, etc.)

**cisgender** (someone whose gender identity matches their sex classification at birth) This once obscure term has become increasingly common and is OK in news stories as long as the meaning is clear from context. The alternative **non-transgender** is also fine in many cases, along the lines of other "non-" words, such as non-Indigenous and non-binary. See [**transgender**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#cisgender "Transgender") for details and related guidelines.

**citizen, citizenship** (n.) When referring to citizenship status, always prefer clear, direct language (e.g., a **Canadian citizen**, a **permanent resident**). Avoid vague or dated terms (e.g., "Canadian national" and "landed immigrant"), except in historical references. And try to steer clear of obscure and highly bureaucratic labels (e.g., "designated foreign national"). If you do need to use compounds like that because the detail is central, always define/explain the jargon. (See also [refugee, asylum seeker, migrant](/home/r/refugee))

**citizens' band, citizens' band radio** (abbreviated as **CB, CB radio**) NOTE: _Apostrophe_ added in 2020. See [possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for details.

**city, city council, city hall** (lowercase in virtually all municipal affairs coverage, including general reference to the administration or building) Examples: "You can't fight **city hall**" and "**Calgary's city hall** will reopen next week" and "a **city council meeting**" and "Protesters gathered outside **city hall in Montreal**." The compound "city hall" is capitalized only in rare cases when the building's proper name is used in a story about the structure, itself, according to standard publishing style (e.g., "Built in the 1870s, **Montreal City Hall** was declared a national historic site by Parks Canada in 1984");**City of Calgary** (corporation, as in "They sued the City of Calgary") _but_ **the city of Calgary** (for all geographic references). In second reference, the generic term **city** is always lowercase in either case. See also [**provinces and cities**](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) for general guidelines on identifying communities in Canada.

**citywide** (one word) See [the suffix wide](/home/w#widesuffix) for other terms, such as "countrywide" versus "Canada-wide"

**Citytv** (Toronto), **CityPulse, CablePulse 24**

**clickbait** (one word)

**clientele**

**climactic** (refers to climax), **climatic** (refers to climate)

**closed-circuit television** or **closed-circuit TV** (hyphens) Avoid the obscure abbreviation CCT in second reference. Use a generic phrase such as "the TV signal" instead.

**closing ceremony, closing ceremonies**, etc. (lowercase)

**Clostridium difficile**, (bacteria) In second reference or in headlines, **C. difficile** is fine (capital C, period, small d, no hyphen, no italics) See [scientific names](/home/l/latin-scientific-names) for more details

**cloud, the** (lowercase) Shorthand for **cloud computing**, coined in the mid-1990s. Commonly refers to off-site data storage available on demand, although it can also mean networks of hardware and software that are accessible remotely. The term "the cloud" doesn't need to be defined as long as its meaning is clear from context (e.g., "computer files in the cloud," "video downloaded from the cloud," and "an app for cloud payments"). See also [internet terms](/home/i/internet-terms) (e.g., blog, chat room, the web).

**cloverleaf** (on highways), **cloverleafs**

**club member, Elks Club, Lions Club**

**cm** (the metric symbol for centimetre is singular and plural; no period) See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial)

**CN** (acceptable on first reference) See [**Canadian National**](/home/c#CN) above

**CN Tower** (Toronto)

**[c-cd](/home/c#c)  -** **[ce-cl](/home/c#ce)**  **-** **[co-cz](/home/c#co)**  **-** **[bottom](/home/c#bottom)**

**Coast for regions**
West Coast, East Coast, Gulf Coast, etc. (See also [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west))

**cocoa** (chocolate drink), **cocoa beans, cocoa butter, cocoa powder, cocoa farmers**, etc. Technically, cocoa powder and chocolate are made from crushed cacao seeds. But the spelling "cacao" is unnecessarily confusing in news stories, even in technical references. Except in rare cases when citing the scientific name (_Theobroma cacao_), prefer **cocoa trees, cocoa crops, cocoa pods,** the **cocoa genome**, etc.

**coconut** _unless part of name_ (as in the Clueless Cocoanut nightclub)

**code blue, code green, code red**, etc. (lowercase) Colour-based codes used by hospital staff, police and other emergency personnel should be defined in stories unless the context makes the meaning clear. For instance, "code blue" usually refers to a medical emergency (e.g., absence of vital signs) but "code brown" may mean anything from a chemical spill to severe weather or a missing adult patient. Quotation marks are optional, and should generally be added only if the jargon is too jarring without the punctuation. The typography of colour codes is conventionally different from capitalized [numeric-based series](/home/n/numbers#series), such as Type 2 diabetes, Phase 3 of a project and a Category 4 hurricane.

**coed, coexist** (no hyphens) See ["co" as a prefix](/home/c#coprefix)

**Colombia** (country in South America), **Colombian** (adj.), **Colombians** (people) Take care with these words. A common mistake is to put a "u" where the second "o" belongs. And most spellcheckers won't catch the error because Columbia is a proper noun element in many names (e.g., British Columbia and District of Columbia).

**colonel** (Col. Brian Bond) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**colons** (See [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

**Comic-Con** Note that this abbreviation for “comic convention” is a registered trademark in Canada and the United States held by the San Diego Comic Convention. Since it is proprietary, consider ways to limit using the abbreviation as a generic term for comic conventions other than in quotes or as part of a proper noun (such as the name of an event).

**anti-communist, non-communist, pro-communist** (general terms)

**Co.** can be used for "**Company**" in business stories or highly formal contexts (XYZ Co.), but otherwise drop from main name. See also [Corp.](/home/c/corporation) Spell out Company if it's part of official title (Canadian Opera Company). Use lowercase for the military (F company).

**concentration camps** (While sometimes used generically to describe temporary holding centres for combatants or non-combatants during war, the term is normally associated with the [Nazi death camps](/home/n#Nazi) run by Hitler's army. Do not use the misleading term "Polish concentration camps" for the facilities built by the Nazis in occupied Poland during the Second World War.)

**Confucius, Confucian** (See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names))

**congenital** (means "from birth," as in a **congenital deformity**) An acceptable but lofty word. Generally prefer simpler and more specific language, such as "blind since birth." See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#congenital) for details.

**Congo** (capital is Kinshasa) Don't use the formal name, Democratic Republic of Congo. The country used to be called Zaire; **Congo, Republic of** (capital is Brazzaville) To avoid confusion between these separate states, see [**Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville**](/home/c/Congos)

**conscientious**

**consensus** (_never_ "consensus of opinion")

**conservative** (averse to risk or quick change; avoiding extremes), sometimes called a **small-c conservative**

**Conservative** (uppercase "C" refers to a political party) as in the **Conservative Party of Canada** (formed when the PCs merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2003), the **Conservative Party** (acceptable shorthand in first reference), the federal Conservatives, etc. (Note: To distinguish between the new and old federal Conservative parties, always include the word "Progressive" before Conservative when writing about the old PCs. For more details, see [Party versus party](/home/p/party) and [Tory](/home/t#Tory).)

**Coon Come, Matthew** (Coon Come in second reference)

**coop** (cage or pen, as in a "chicken coop"), but **co-op, co-operate, co-operation** (hyphens) See ["co" as a prefix](/home/c#coprefix)

**Co-operative Commonwealth Federation** (**CCF** fine in first reference)

**co-opt** (v.), **co-optation, co-option, co-optive**

**co-ordinate, co-ordinator, co-ordination**

**cop, cops** (generally avoid in news stories, unless the tone suits the piece) In a feature about a retired law enforcement officer, the colloquial and monosyllabic term cop might be the best choice for colour or rhythm. In most news stories, however, prefer **police officer** or a specific rank for an individual when known (**constable, sergeant** ), as well as the general term **police** for plural constructions.

**Copenhagen** (not "Kobenhaun," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames) )

**Correctional Service of Canada, correctional service** (Generally avoid the obscure abbreviation CSC unless defined) The established nickname **Corrections Canada** is both meaningful and perfectly acceptable in first reference. The Correctional Service of Canada was created in 1978. The federal agency is responsible for the incarceration and rehabilitation of criminals sentenced to serve at least two years. It replaced older organizations, such as the Canadian Penitentiary Service.)

**the county of Wellington** , _but_ **Wellington County** , County Cork, etc.

**coup** but **_coup d'état_** (See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) ) A coup is conventionally defined as the removal of an elected leader by force or threat of force, followed by the instalment of an unelected leader. The military is often involved, either actively (i.e., deposing the leader) or indirectly (i.e., stepping aside and condoning the ouster).

**cross-border, cross-checking, cross-country, cross-examine, cross-examination**

**crossbow** (one word) Crossbows fire special arrows often called bolts. Insisting that we call crossbow projectiles "bolts" is akin to insisting that we call the feathers on arrows "fletches." It's jargon to our audience. But suggesting that crossbow arrows are the same as regular arrows fired from bows doesn't tell our audience the full story. When details are known about the weapon, it's helpful to mention the specific difference (e.g., weighted arrows or slotted arrows). Otherwise, more generic modifiers are fine (e.g., special arrows or even crossbow arrows).

**crossfire**

**crossover** (adj.), as in **crossover music, crossover utility vehicle** (**CUV** OK in second reference)

**cruise** (missile)

**Crusades**

**crybaby** (no hyphen), **crybabies**

**cryptocurrency** (n., adj.) Commonly refers to a specific form of digital currency that's not issued or controlled by a central bank. Cryptocurrency uses sophisticated encryption technology as well as a special type of embedded ledger keeping. The latter, dubbed "blockchain," amounts to a buried log of transactions that makes it: (1) hard for authorities to track private transfers from computer to computer as well as (2) difficult for users to steal, counterfeit or distort (e.g., spend more than once). **Be aware that there's a debate over whether cryptocurrency is actually a "currency" at all,** since that word often implies a type of money (paper, coins) that can be deposited into and withdrawn from banks. This is largely a semantics battle, since the word "currency," itself, can be broadly defined as something of value that's currently in circulation. But **avoid shortening the noun "cryptocurrency" to "currency" in stories. Instead, prefer either the specific name of the cryptocurrency** (e.g., bitcoin) **or nouns such as "tokens" or "coins."** NOTE: The term cryptocurrency, first used in the early 1990s, originally meant a "substitute currency" that had nothing to do with digital money. Instead, the new or makeshift currency's value was "hidden" (cryptic) in ordinary goods (e.g., a carton of cigarettes or a bottle of vodka in a country with hyperinflation). Since around 2009, however, the term has been associated almost exclusively with digital transactions. **The word cryptocurrency has become so common it no longer needs to be defined in news stories** . By contrast, **the names of most unique cryptocurrencies remain largely unfamiliar** (e.g., ether, tether, dogecoin) **and, so, need to be explained** to a general audience. The **primary exception is [bitcoin](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/b/#bitcoin "B")** , which has been around since 2009. In investment circles, bitcoin is so well known that other cryptocurrencies are sometimes informally dubbed "alternatives to bitcoin," with the shorthand "altcoin" used. Avoid "altcoin" in stories, however, unless it's defined. Instead, use clearer phrasing, such as "other cryptocurrencies" or "lesser-known tokens." (See also [NFT](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/n/#NFT "N") )

**crystal meth** (fine in first reference) There is no need to write out crystal methamphetamine. Always point out that crystal meth is a highly addictive drug. It can be defined as a common form of methamphetamine hydrochloride, especially in features or science stories, but this technical term is not required. Methamphetamines are chemical variations of amphetamines. (For more information, see the CBC.ca background piece [crystal meth](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fbackground%2Fdrugs%2Fcrystalmeth.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3_fQLg-4JI6AHT5pGapDAK) )

**[C Series](/home/a/aircraft-names)** (space; no hyphen) Bombardier jet

**CT** (central time) Avoid specifying standard (CST) or daylight (CDT) except when reporting clock readings for Saskatchewan, which is on CST all year. See [time](/home/t/time) for detailed guidelines.

**CT scan** (no need to spell out as _computed tomography_ ) Prefer this term over CAT scan, unless you're certain the older technology is featured in the story you're writing. (See [CT and CAT scans](/home/c/ct-and-cat-scans) for details. Also, compare with [MRI](/home/m#MRI) .)

**CTVglobemedia** (Previously controlled by BCE Inc.) Changed name from "Bell Globemedia" in 2007.

**cubicle** (small partitioned space); **cubical** (cube-shaped)

**cubism, cubist** (see general guidelines on [art styles](/home/a#art) , movements, etc.)

**cue** (a prompt, a billiards stick) _Do not confuse with_ **queue** (a line of people)

**cull** (to select and remove from a group, especially animals designated for slaughter) Acceptable term when reporting on the killing of livestock (e.g., the culling of a rancher's herd). See also [euthanasia](/home/e/euthanasia#animalslaughter) for different wording more suitable in certain cases

**CUV** (OK in second reference to **crossover utility vehicle** )

**CVRD Inco Ltd.** (New mining company formed after Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil purchased Inco in 2006) **CVRD Inco** normally sufficient in first reference.

**cyberattack, cybercafé, cybercrime, cybernetics, cybersex, cyberspace, cyberstalking, cyberterrorism**

**[cyclone](/home/w/weather-words#cyclone), Cyclone Larry, Cyclone Nargis** (Larry, Nargis in second reference; or "the cyclone" lowercase. See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines.) Do not apply the pronouns "she," "her," "he" or "his" to storms. Use "it" and "its" instead.

**cyclosporine**

**cystic fibrosis**

**czar** (_not_ tsar); **Czar Nicholas**

**Czech Republic** (became independent in 1993 after the peaceful breakup of the former Czechoslovakia) The country's formal name remains the Czech Republic, the English translation of _Česká Republika_. In order to encourage a one-word proper noun (along the lines of "France" for the French Republic), Czech authorities have recommended various forms be adopted in different languages. In 2016, **Czechia** was chosen as the official English short form. For simplicity and clarity, however, CBC News prefers Czech Republic in most cases because it's both accurate and widely known. If Czechia is used in stories (e.g., in a broadcast clip or transcribed quote) the name should be explained to avoid confusion (e.g., "also known as Czechia") unless the meaning is already clear from context (e.g., in a sports tournament). While we often prefer entrenched short forms for countries (e.g., South Korea and Sri Lanka rather than the "Republic of Korea" and the "Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka"), audience recognition is a key criterion.

### Canada Revenue Agency

**Canada Revenue Agency**

The federal government's tax collecting body has had a variety of names over the years. Since 2003, it's been the Canada Revenue Agency (shortened from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, adopted in 1999).

Generally use the noun **Canada Revenue Agency** in first reference. **CRA is OK in web headlines and second reference**. (For several years, the abbreviation was obscure and confusing. But CRA is now widely recognized.) Lowercase generic terms such as the **agency** are also fine in second reference.

The well-established shorthand **Revenue Canada** remains OK in some cases as long as context is provided. For instance, a story's second reference could be expanded to include wording such as: _"The agency, still commonly known as Revenue Canada, ...."_

**'Revenue Canada' background**
The term Revenue Canada began as an informal name for the Department of National Revenue many decades ago, and has since become part of the Canadian lexicon. The department was eventually turned into a federal agency that reports to the minister of national revenue, but the old, unofficial label stuck.

Numerous news organizations continue to use Revenue Canada as acceptable shorthand in headlines and second reference, in the same way that "StatsCan" is used informally for Statistics Canada, "the Habs" (clipped from _les Habitants_) is a synonym for the Montreal Canadiens, and "the World Bank" is often preferred over the much longer International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. **Criticism that the term Revenue Canada is inaccurate because the agency's official name has changed several times is considered unwarranted since Revenue Canada was never actually an official noun.**

It's worth noting that using shorthand such as Revenue Canada can sometimes help our audience get CBCNews.ca content — based on "search engine optimization" best practices (i.e., because meaningful keywords in our journalism enable tools such as Google to find our online content faster and to rank our stories higher). This was certainly true during the first decade of this century, when the abbreviation CRA had still not become part of everyday speech.

### Canadian court terms

**Use Canadian terms for court coverage**

Despite the increasingly common use of U.S. legal jargon in everyday English, CBC News maintains a preference for Canadian court terminology.

We don't offer gavel-to-gavel coverage, for example, because **Canada's judges do not use gavels**. Our **sheriffs** are court officials rather than police officers, carrying out judges' orders, serving warrants, seizing property, etc. Not all Canadian lawyers are attorneys. (The term attorney is normally reserved for official titles, such as "attorney-general," and specific jobs, such as "Crown attorney" — more commonly known as "Crown prosecutor.") In Canadian criminal cases, the person charged is known as **the accused** rather than the defendant. The words **plaintiff** or petitioner and **defendant** or respondent apply to civil cases. Also, most Canadian courtrooms have distinct physical characteristics, such as a **prisoner's box** (_not_ prisoner's dock) and a **witness box** (_not_ witness stand). Use Canadian terminology (e.g., **[impaired driving](/home/i/impaired_driving)**) rather than Americanisms (DUI).

## **Preferences worth preserving**

Distinguishing between, say, a witness box and a witness stand is comparable to picking [half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) over half-staff and [railway](/home/r/railway-versus-railroad) over railroad. Both sets of terms may be relatively common, but historically the former are considered standard "Canadian English." When we start using American preferences (or American spellings), we get complaints.

The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage puts it this way:

> _In Canadian and British courtrooms, witnesses testify from a 'witness box.' Because American legal dramas are common fare on Canadian television, American legal terminology creeps into Canadian usage. American courtrooms have a 'witness stand,' and witnesses 'take the stand.' Some Canadians strongly object to the use of American terminology in Canadian contexts._

## **But sometimes there's no box**

**While preferences such as "witness box" and "prisoner's box" for Canadian court coverage are embraced by CBC News** and many other media outlets, including the Globe and Mail, **a caveat is worth noting:** Trials are sometimes held outside normal courtroom settings (e.g., a school or community hall). In these rare cases, the usual courtroom furniture will probably be missing, and no one will actually be "in the witness box." **Generic terms such as "testify" are recommended when the physical layout of a courtroom is unknown.**

## **Criminal Code terminology**

We're not obligated to include verbatim statute citations when reporting on crime or the courts, but **we should be accurate when referring to actual charges**. If in doubt, always check specific wording.

**In the Criminal Code of Canada, for instance, the expression "necessities of life" does not appear.** Rather, **the comparatively archaic noun "necessaries" is used** throughout Section 215:


> [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-215.html](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flaws-lois.justice.gc.ca%2Feng%2Facts%2FC-46%2Fsection-215.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1taGa0-2gQY4pA8Bk2nBEv)


This doesn't mean we can't describe people's obligations to provide the necessities of life to those in their care, or even to report in a generic way on accusations that a parent, guardian or spouse failed to provide the necessities of life. But **we should stick with the statute's actual language** (i.e., "necessaries") **in all direct references to specific sections of the Criminal Code**, including when wording such as "charged with" or "pleaded guilty to" is used.

Verbatim citations can include some wiggle room, of course. For example, although Section 215 also drops the article "the" before "necessaries," it's an acceptable convention to adopt minor syntax adjustments (e.g., adding "the" in this case) if it makes Criminal Code wording either clearer or easier to read.

### capital, Capitol

**Capitol, capitol and capital**

**Capitol Hill** and **the Capitol** (the official building of the [U.S. Congress](/home/c/congress)) both refer to the legislative branch of government in Washington, D.C.

The term **capitol** (lowercase) is sometimes used to mean legislature buildings in many, but not all, states.

The word **capital** (lowercase) refers to the seat of government in a country, province, state or other region. (Canada's capital is Ottawa. Montana's capital is Helena. And Helena has a state capitol building where the legislature sits.)

Capital, of course, has other meanings. To investors, it represents money. To economists it means a physical "factor of production" (e.g., a factory or a mine) that can be combined with labour. To typographers, it's the difference between O and o, which brings us back to the beginning, and the letter that makes Capitol distinct.

If you're not sure which word to pick, it's always a capital idea to look these things up.

### Capitalization

**Capitalization**

**TV TEXT REMINDER:** Be aware that television graphics, banners, supers, etc., have some unique typographical conventions that don't always match the basics highlighted below. The biggest difference is the use of more initial capital letters in titles, job descriptions, etc. (e.g., "Former Prime Minister" instead of former prime minister, and "High School Principal" instead of high school principal). See the [**TV Text overview**](/home/t/tv_text) for details.

**We generally follow The Canadian Press's lead when making decisions about various points of typography, including capital letters.** (See [Web publishing: Why a 'Modified CP Style'?](/home/s/spelling/modified-cp-style) for details.)

**Names and other proper nouns need to be capitalized** (the _Rocky Mountains_, _Prime Minister Red Buttons_), **but generic terms** (_the mountains_) **and titles not followed by names** (_the prime minister_) **are generally kept lowercase. There are exceptions, however,** including _the King_ and _the Governor General_.

Too Many Capital Letters in Sentences become Distracting, including when a lot of abbreviations appear. (_The VIPs from the NATO-backed group BIGGER plan to OK a UNESCO proposal._)

So **keep words lowercase unless you're sure capital letters apply.** For instance, we would write: _Canada's military_ (but the Canadian Forces), _Israel's army, GM president John Jones,_ the zoo's _chief_ _veterinarian Kim Woo,_ and so forth. Don't use capital letters for titles or events simply because some company or government agency does.

And **don't elevate most generic terms** (e.g., _draft, final, playoffs, game or championship_) **just because an event is held only once a year.** We write _NBA draft, NHL final, Stanley Cup playoffs, Grey Cup game_ and _World Series championship_. **A common exception is _[NBA Finals](/home/b/basketball)_,** with a capital "F," **because the league's championship series doesn't have a proper noun like Stanley Cup or Grey Cup to distinguish it.** NOTE: The same rule for lowercase nouns like "Stanley Cup final" and "Grey Cup game" applies to a host of other labels that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase lettering, such as _Type 2 diabetes_ (**not** "Type 2 Diabetes") and _Category 3 hurricane_ (**not** "Category 3 Hurricane").

Note: **Sentences and headlines virtually always start with a capital letter**, even in the case of quirky nouns that are lowercase, such as **eBay** or **k.d. lang** — which should be posted as **EBay** and **K.d. lang** at the start of sentences (or as **Lang** alone if it's a second reference).

**We do not always follow CP, usually because we think a different version is more accurate, logical or common** (e.g., we used iPod rather than IPod several years before The Canadian Press adopted the lowercase "i") **or easier for readers scanning our web pages** (e.g., Hurricane Katrina rather than hurricane Katrina). **So be sure to consult the Language Guide first.**

**The rest of this page outlines the fundamentals of CBCNews.ca capitalization.** Several sections have links to more detailed discussions (e.g., titles, abbreviations, and trademarks). Online editorial staff should review the Canadian Press Stylebook's detailed, 30-page section on capitalization for anything not covered below.

### carbon\_tax\_levy


**Carbon pricing, carbon tax, carbon levy**

1\. [Carbon pricing](/home/c/carbon_tax_levy#carbon_pricing)
2\. [Carbon tax, carbon levy](/home/c/carbon_tax_levy#tax_levy) (both OK)
3\. [Be aware of political spin](/home/c/carbon_tax_levy#tax_politics) (tax, levy)
4\. [Legal vs. common use of 'tax'](/home/c/carbon_tax_levy#legal_usage)


**1\. Carbon pricing**
**The umbrella term "carbon pricing" refers to government-imposed costs on carbon emissions** to try to reduce pollution linked to global warming. **Two common methods are:**


> **(i) Taxes/levies** (i.e., direct charges on consumers and industry); and
>
> **(ii) A cap-and-trade system on industry** (i.e., companies pay penalties for pollution above certain levels, but they can also buy and sell unused emissions quotas under specified conditions).


**Carbon pricing also describes hybrid approaches**, which combine direct charges with cap-and-trade, as outlined in the [Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fservices%2Fenvironment%2Fweather%2Fclimatechange%2Fpan-canadian-framework%2Fclimate-change-plan.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2wyXn4ICgR6zrEVf40_yMG), endorsed by federal, provincial and territorial leaders in 2016. Statistics Canada now includes "carbon taxes" tied to the federal government's "carbon pollution pricing system" when compiling and analyzing data on environmental taxes, such as in this [2019-2020 summary](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/231213/dq231213c-eng.htm) published in December of 2023.

**2\. Carbon tax, carbon levy** (both OK)
It's an **acceptable convention to use the terms carbon tax and carbon levy interchangeably.**

**All taxes are "levied"** through a given government's taxation powers. The word **"tax" traditionally refers to more than just levies for fiscal programs**. Among other things, **the term also applies to various charges imposed by governments to try to influence the behaviour of consumers and/or businesses** in an economy. This common definition appears in many publications, from economics textbooks to various dictionaries, such as:


> _TAX — A mandatory payment made by individuals and corporations to government. Taxes are levied on income or wealth or are imposed on goods and services to finance the cost of government services, to redistribute income, and to influence the behaviour of consumers and investors...._

> > — David Crane
>
> > Canadian Dictionary of Business and Economics


**Higher taxes on cigarettes** to discourage smoking, **higher taxes on gas-guzzling cars** to boost the sale of more efficient vehicles, and **higher taxes on industrial pollution** to encourage businesses to reduce harmful emissions are examples. The word "tax" is also used when referring to numerous tax credits and rebates, including those designed to make greener products more appealing to consumers, and R&D investments more attractive to businesses. Indeed, **behavioural influence is at the very heart of the expression "tax incentive."**

**3\. Be aware of political spin** (tax, levy)
**The word "tax," itself, does not automatically constitute bias in our journalism.** Some people point out that the expression "carbon tax" is often favoured by critics of the government initiative. They argue that "carbon levy" or "carbon charge" are better choices because "tax" has overly negative overtones — often associated with higher prices (consumption taxes), lower take home pay (income taxes), etc. But **we report neutrally on various tax measures all the time, including sales taxes, goods and service taxes, gasoline taxes, excise taxes, etc.** Banning the expression "carbon tax" solely because some individuals prefer different wording would be unjustified and inconsistent.

Furthermore, "**carbon tax" has been the language actually used by different governments at different times.** It's worth remembering that **North America's first broad-based carbon tax was introduced by the B.C. Liberal government in 2008 with the word "tax" in the legislation's title**: British Columbia's [Carbon Tax Act](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bclaws.ca%2FRecon%2Fdocument%2FID%2Ffreeside%2F00_08040_01&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1tZOqDU6HgjG8-etiQ55IR). Since then, other provinces have used the expressions "carbon levy" and "carbon tax" interchangeably — depending in part on the party in power and whether the charges were being added or removed. In Alberta, for example, the United Conservative government passed the [Carbon Tax Repeal Act](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qp.alberta.ca%2F1266.cfm%3Fpage%3D2019ch01.cfm%26leg_type%3DActs%26isbncln%3D9780779810574%26display%3Dhtml&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3sBL_k5G-xJvebJ9f58C8r) in 2019 that eliminated what the province's previous NDP government has preferred to call a "carbon levy" in its 2016 [Climate Leadership Act](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canlii.org%2Fen%2Fab%2Flaws%2Fstat%2Fsa-2016-c-c-16.9%2Flatest%2Fsa-2016-c-c-16.9.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3QIMRFQ12Z8ih2PsEAVBeG). And the Northwest Territories [introduced a "carbon tax" in 2019](https://www.fin.gov.nt.ca/en/services/carbon-tax) that was increased in 2023.

It can be valuable to report changes in a given government's language when there's room in stories and the detail is relevant. Such background may help our audience better understand the overall picture, including any apparent shifts in communications strategy. But **there's no compelling editorial argument to insist on a preference between "carbon tax" and "carbon levy," or to impose narrower definitions in our journalism.** The terms are conventionally considered synonyms in public policy debates, in general business and economics reporting, etc. We consider such usage accurate and clear.

**4\. Legal vs. common use of 'tax'**
A final point about legal versus common usage merits mention. **We have occasionally received complaints that the label "carbon tax" is wrong because some judges have classified the expression in some other way.** For example, when Ontario's highest court upheld Ottawa's Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act as constitutional in June 2019, it concluded that the disputed "carbon tax" was not actually a "tax" at all but, rather, was a "regulatory charge." The reason? A majority of judges on the panel said that, in law, "taxes" are imposed primarily to raise revenues for general fiscal purposes. (See [paragraph 145 of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontariocourts.ca%2Fdecisions%2F2019%2F2019ONCA0544.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw30_-n73MQufuUSP32zCVtJ) for details). And [when the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the federal government's carbon pricing regime as constitutional](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fscc-csc.lexum.com%2Fscc-csc%2Fscc-csc%2Fen%2Fitem%2F18781%2Findex.do&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3WeAFa-_CL5wTTybbHxOBg) in a 6-3 ruling in March 2021, the majority decision specifically acknowledged that the common expression "carbon tax" used by many "policy experts" has "no connection to the concept of taxation as understood in the constitutional context."

**However, legal definitions do not always reflect common speech or common sense**, as we've pointed out in our response to formal CBC ombudsman complaints about our use of the expression "carbon tax" in the past. **In 1928, for instance, Canada's top court ruled that the word "person"** in the British North America Act **did not include women.** A more recent example is found in **Ontario's 2016 Trespass to Property Act**, which **says the noun "premises" includes water and motor vehicles.** The wording of [Section 1 (1) of the trespassing law](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontario.ca%2Flaws%2Fstatute%2F90t21&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3YHKgj_IM2F4zwmUbz8vzx) is a convenient way to cover a wide swath of prohibitions (e.g., it's illegal to swim in a neighbour's pool, or to get into someone else's car, without permission). But it's also a highly unorthodox use of the term "premises" — and one that we would not embrace in our journalism. Put another way: If a CBC reporter described automobiles as "premises," the script would almost certainly be revised, regardless of how the same word is defined in various legal contexts. **At the end of the day, just because a court states that the word "tax" has a relatively narrow, legal definition does not mean that this legal definition is preferred at large.**

**CBC News continues to use the established expressions "carbon tax" and "carbon levy' interchangeably because we think this language is accurate and clear — mirroring everyday usage.** Furthermore, as already noted in Point No. 2 above, economists have used the word "tax" in an equally broad way for years, which makes a compound such as "carbon tax" more than merely colloquial. **It's OK to mention a specific court's comments about a term such as "tax" when it's relevant to given coverage**, and when it's practical (i.e., when there's room in a given story), but it's also important to remember that judges are not the final arbiters of established, acceptable English usage in our journalism.

### Catholic Roman

**Catholic versus Roman Catholic**

Roman Catholics acknowledge the Pope as the head of their church.
**
Generally use Roman Catholic on first reference when specifically excluding Eastern-rites Catholic churches**, such as Eastern Orthodox, Polish National Catholic, Lusitanian (Portugal) and Philippine Independent Catholic.

**But Roman is not necessary if it's obvious from the context** (e.g., "The Catholic school board" is OK, even in the lead).

### cattle

**Cattle**

We don't need to define common labels such as cow in news stories. But we do need to use ranching terms correctly.

> **cattle:** A generic word that includes cows, bulls, heifers and steers.
>
> **cow:** A mature _female_ bovine.
>
> **bull:** An uncastrated _male_ bovine.
>
> **calf:** A young bovine (_male_ or _female_).
>
> **heifer:** A young _female_ bovine (usually one that has not borne a calf).
>
> **steer:** A castrated _male_ bovine.
>
> **beef:** The flesh of a cow, steer or bull used as food.
>
> **veal:** The flesh of a calf used as food.


**Avoid phrases such as "a herd of cows"** unless you're sure there are no steers among them. The safest choice is **"a herd of cattle."**

Remember: A significant number of rural Canadians listen to, watch and read CBC News. They complain when we're inaccurate or sloppy about farming language.

### CBC

**CBC**

The **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation** may be referred to as **the CBC** throughout stories. It's not wrong to spell it out, but it's also not necessary. If shortened versions of the proper name are used in second or later references, they should be lowercase (e.g., the corporation, the broadcaster, Canada's public broadcaster).

**The definite article** (_the_) **can be dropped in headlines, but should generally appear in the main text of online news stories when the abbreviation functions as a noun** (e.g., "_The CBC plans special coverage_" not "_CBC plans special coverage_"), **including in many possessive constructions** (e.g., prefer "The CBC's Jane Smith reports"). **But to keep our broadcast journalism conversational, there is more latitude on air** (e.g., "CBC's investigation" and "CBC's Jane Smith reports" are acceptable). **Compound nouns** (CBC News) **and adjectival forms take articles only when normal rules of syntax require them** (a CBC reporter; CBC coverage began at noon ET; CBC News obtained the documents last month; the CBC-TV program).


> **CBC** (uppercase; no spaces, hyphens or periods), **the
> ****CBC Radio
> ****CBC-TV** or **CBC Television
> CBC News
> ****CBC News** (refers to the entire news service: television, radio and the internet)
> [**CBCNews.ca**](/home/c/cbc#CBCversusCBCNews) (the CBC's web news service; **the preferred address to promote our online journalism**)
> **CBC.ca** (the CBC's entire English website; the corporation's French's website is Radio-Canada.ca, NEVER "SRC.ca")
> **CBC Sports
> ****CBCSports.ca**


Some other common nouns are:


> **CBC Radio One; CBC Music** (previously known **CBC Radio Two** from 1997 until 2007, and then as **CBC Radio 2** until 2018); **CBC Radio 3**
> **the CBC News Network, CBC NN** (OK in headlines) This 24-hour TV news network was known as CBC Newsworld from 1989-2009.


In news stories, never adopt any of the lowercase versions of the above names that appear in graphics, newspaper ads, television promos and other marketing campaigns (e.g., cbc.ca, cbcradio, cbctelevision, cbcnews, etc.).

> _The IOC was responding to comments in a column on CBCSports.ca._
>
> _After publishing her second novel, she began writing a blog for CBCNews.ca._


For guidelines on attribution such as "**told CBC News,**" see the [Quotes overview](/).

The possessive is CBC News's, as in "CBC News's coverage of the election." See [s' versus s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s) for details.


**Programs**
The article **"the" is uppercase and italicized before the names of programs only when it's officially part of the title:**

> _The Current_
>
> _The House_


**Otherwise, keep "the" lowercase and in regular type:**

> _the Dragons' Den_
>
> _the Royal Canadian Air Farce_


See also [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the) as well as [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) for other relevant guidelines.

**CBC News in titles of newscasts**
**In first reference, generally add _"CBC News"_ to the title of the corporation's television and radio newscasts**, as well as to CBC News Network live news programs that are considered extended newscasts. Use italics.

> _CBC News: Now_
>
> _CBC News: The National_
>
> _CBC News: The World at Six_
>
> _CBC News: The World This Hour_


Second reference:

> _Now_
>
> _The National_
>
> _The World at Six_
>
> _The World This Hour_


**Do not add _"CBC News"_ to the titles of CBC News Network programs that are not considered newscasts.** Such shows are either normally not live (e.g., current affairs programs first broadcast on another network) or are live but include the names of hosts in their titles. Use italics.

> _Power & Politics_ (title conventionally does not include host's name in first reference)
>
> _The Nature of Things_ (not a CBCNN original, live broadcast)
>
> _The Passionate Eye_ (not a CBCNN original, live broadcast)


For general guidelines on use of "&" versus "and" (e.g., A&W versus the Globe and Mail), see [ampersand](/home/a/ampersand). For an overview on regular versus slanted type, see [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**Text versus logos (Generally use standard capitalization)**
**In web news stories, generally avoid adopting unorthodox capitalization of programs.** For instance:

> _W5 used to be called W-Five_ (not "W-FIVE")
>
> _Play_ (not ">play")
>
> _Counterspin_ (not "counterSpin")
>
> _Nova_ (not "NOVA")


**Be aware of corporate preferences for branding capitalization preferences.** For example, _the fifth estate_ was referred to as "_the fifth estate_" for decades until capital letters were reintroduced in 2017, and then again replaced with lowercase letters in 2025. The CBC Radio program _Q_ was known as "_q_" from 2015 until 2021. Use the current capitalization regardless of the time period cited.

**Do not take capitalization direction from graphics, logos or marketing material** such as posters, coffee mugs and shirts. That's because **we write words** (CBC News and CBC Radio) **not logos** ("cbcnews" or "cbc radio") in our journalism.

**Apply the same principle to channels and networks.** For instance: Bold (not "bold") for the digital channel that replaced CBC Country Canada in 2008.

**This is consistent with our approach to recasting unorthodox capitalization used by other companies.** For example, we write Adidas (not adidas), Amtrak (not AMTRAK), Ikea (not IKEA), Nasdaq (not NASDAQ), Scrabble (not SCRABBLE), Via Rail (not VIA Rail), Visa (not VISA), etc. **We follow unusual capitalization of a few public figures' names, but only if widespread usage has established the exception** (e.g., e.e. cummings and k.d. lang).

See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization), [names versus logos](/home/n/names-versus-logos), [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) in broadcast titles and [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the).

For a detailed look at CBCNews.ca's switch to _internet_ and _web_ in the fall of 2003, see the Words: Woe & Wonder column "[i for an I and other capital punishment](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Finternet_i.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0f1hPq1UK33wYvMaaDnnRq)."

**CBC.ca vs. CBCNews.ca**
**The corporation's entire internet service should be referred to as CBC.ca** (e.g., _The attack shut down most major media websites in North America, including CBC.ca_). **Do NOT use it as a synonym for CBCNews.ca**, which is the name of the CBC's online news service (e.g., _Her first public reaction to the allegation appeared in a column on CBCNews.ca_).

When web addresses are reproduced, they can be lowercase (www.cbc.ca), but this almost never happens on the news site. Normally a link's pathway is hidden under the text we choose to put in HTML code.

Generally leave the slash (/) out of CBC names cited in our journalism:


> **CBC Digital Archives**
>
> **CBC.ca Kids**
>
> **Kids' CBC** (for preschoolers)


Apply this style to specific components of CBCNews.ca as well. For instance:


> **CBCNews.ca Arts**
>
> **CBCNews.ca Health**


Such nouns function as the names of units or services rather than as cyberspace locations.

Different guidelines apply to rare cases when specific web addresses are reported as text (rather than being embedded as HTML in links):

> _Preston Manning's CBC Radio project This I Believe was based on a 1950s program hosted by Edward R. Murrow, who died decades before the interactivity of the web made instant contributions to sites like cbc.ca/thisibelieve possible._

### centre versus center

**Centre versus Center**

**The generic (lowercase) word is always spelled “centre.”

Use “er” only in the proper names of** (mostly) **U.S. buildings, organizations, etc.**


> _Centre of Forensic Sciences_ (Toronto)
> _Hummingbird Centre
> __Munk Centre for International Studies
> __Rockefeller Center
> __U.S. National Hurricane Center
> __U.S. national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention_ (lowercase "national" and plural “Centers”)
> _World Trade Center_ (_WTC_ is fine in headlines or second reference)


**Be aware that anomalous Canadian spellings of proper nouns surface periodically.** We normally use the source's rendering (e.g., "Center") as long as it's determined to be the formal, established name:


> _Canadian Center for Vaccinology_ (Halifax-based research facility founded in 2007)


**In second reference, lowercase "centre" would still be used** in these cases. To avoid needless spelling clashes within the same story, a different generic noun should be considered (e.g., research lab, health unit, music hall, theatre), depending on whatever words apply.

See also [defence, labour and centre](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre/ "Defence labour and centre") for why U.S. government departments that feature American spellings of the words "defence" and "labour" are handled differently (e.g., U.S. Defence Department rather than "Defense").
See also [spelling](/home/s/spelling) (an overview).

### chair

**Chair**

**Generally keep lowercase**, including before names:


> _The board's chair is expected to resign.
> English department chair Himari Tanaka called it indefensible plagiarism._


The **main exceptions are specific research positions treated as proper nouns** based on unique, identified endowments:


> _The [Canada Research Chairs](/home/c#CRC) program.
> The university's Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Law agreed.
> She is the Ontario Research Chair in Bioethics at Queen's University._



**Prefer gender-neutral form**
To avoid sexist language (e.g., referring to a woman as a “chairman”), **the CBC prefers the neutral and increasingly common noun “chair” in general contexts:**


> _She’s been the board’s chair for the past two years.
> __He was appointed chair of the committee in 2003._


**Another option is to pick a different word, such as “head.”

Chair is also fine as a verb:**


> _She chaired the meeting._


**Chairman, chairwoman, chairperson**
**Although “chair” is preferred, it’s OK to use “chairman” or “chairwoman” if the sex of the person is known.**

The term “chairperson” is less common than “spokesperson.” It’s also unnecessary (unless transcribing direct quotations) because “chair” is shorter and equally neutral.

**Warning: It’s inconsistent to use “chairman” for men and “chair” for women in the same news story. So pick one form** and stick with it from beginning to end.

See also [spokesperson](/home/s/spokeperson)

### chemical names

**Chemical names, elements, abbreviations**

Prefer the known over the obscure. When using terms from the worlds of chemistry, biology, etc., this often means words (**sugar** rather than **C12H22O11**) but can mean letters when the shorthand is better known (**DNA** rather than **deoxyribonucleic acid**).

In some cases, technical abbreviations are fine in headlines and second reference (**CO2** for **carbon dioxide**) because they have become common. But be careful to use the correct term. **CO**, for example, is short for **carbon monoxide** — a colourless, odourless toxic gas. Many people have **CO detectors** in their homes.

Even when an abbreviation will be recognized, exercise judgment. While a term such as **H2O** is immediately understood to mean **water**, it is not conversational and is usually reserved for humorous effect.

### child\_pornography

**Child pornography**

The term child pornography has previously been legally and conventionally used in Canada and elsewhere to describe content of a sexual nature involving minors. However, **it is a phrase now best used only with direct attribution and not as shorthand**. This means, for example, that “child porn” should not be used in headlines or banners.

Importantly, as of Oct. 10, 2025, **the term child pornography no longer exists in the Criminal Code of Canada. It has been replaced by “child sexual abuse and exploitation material.”

**This means it is no longer accurate to say that someone in Canada has been charged with making, possessing, distributing or accessing child pornography. Rather, it would be important to specify that the charge is making, possessing, distributing or accessing child sexual abuse and exploitation material. You might consider contextualizing for audiences by briefly mentioning that the charge used to be known as child pornography.
**This also reflects the language choice of many international agencies to avoid using the term.** For example, the Luxembourg Guidelines, established by a working group of 18 organizations including Interpol, Unicef and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights state:

The term “child sexual abuse material” is increasingly being used to replace the term “child pornography.” This switch of terminology is based on the argument that sexualised material that depicts or otherwise represents children is indeed a representation, and a form, of child sexual abuse, and should not be described as “pornography.”

However, **the phrase child pornography may be appropriate when referencing, with direct attribution, quotations from people or other documents that still use the term.** For example, it is still used in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and in the United Nations Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. **It may also be accurate to use the term in reference to charges that were laid before the update to the Criminal Code of Canada.**

Caveats to keep in mind when covering stories involving this type of content:

-   Follow all relevant JSP policy, including guidelines covering taste, the depiction of violence and audience warnings.

-   Ensure that explicit material has been suitably censored if incorporated into stories. It's illegal to possess, publish or broadcast child sexual abuse and exploitation material. When in doubt, check with the CBC legal team.

-   Be clear but exercise restraint with descriptions, leaving out gratuitous detail when describing content that is, or is alleged to be, child sexual abuse and exploitation material.

-   Avoid slang like "kiddie porn" outside of directly transcribed quotes. Such informal colloquialisms can introduce a tone that's inappropriate and offensive.

-   Recognize that the modifier "child" can be confusing or misleading when the victims are close to 18. (See [child, teen, young adult, etc.](/home/c/child_teen) for related guidelines on age ranges.)

-   The word [pedophile](/home/p/pedophile) is OK when the facts fit (i.e., a perverse sexual attraction to young, usually prepubescent, children). But avoid the expression "convicted pedophile," which is inaccurate, since pedophilia is not a crime one can be charged with in Canada.

### child\_prostitution

**Child prostitute (avoid), child sex trafficking**

**Distinguish between prostitution involving adults and "prostitution" involving people under 18**. The former has been at the centre of public policy debates in Canada over the decades, with voices for and against legalization. The latter, by contrast, has been universally decried by legislators as vile sexual exploitation.

**The term "child prostitution" is increasingly viewed as inappropriate and outmoded.** It still appears in some proper nouns (e.g., the international group ECPAT stands for "End Child Prostitution and Trafficking"), but law enforcement language in many jurisdictions has shifted. **Always frame stories in ways that make it clear the children are victims** in what is essentially human trafficking and assault. **Expressions like "child sex trafficking" and "child sexual exploitation" are often preferred** because the language stresses enslavement and abuse in a way that the word "prostitution" alone may not convey (e.g., a biker gang is accused of running a "child sex trafficking ring" rather than a "child prostitution ring").

**Avoid wording that even indirectly suggests youths in the sex industry are willing participants rather than exploited prey**. In particular, **do not use labels like "child prostitute," "underage prostitute," "teen prostitute," etc.**, unless attributed (e.g., in witness testimony or other quotes). For starters, there's the legal issue of consent. No one under 16 can agree to sex with an adult in Canada, and those between 16 and 18 cannot agree under various conditions (e.g., when the person is a guardian or in a position of authority). Furthermore, **terms like "child prostitute" characterize minors in misleading ways**. Such language can wrongly imply that young people trapped in the horrors of the sex trade are entrepreneurs voluntarily selling their bodies rather than manipulated and abused victims. **Calling kids who are being assaulted "prostitutes" is as inapt as referring to the victims of child pornography as "pornographers."**

In addition to exercising care with descriptions of exploited youths, we should be as precise as possible with how we label the adults involved. **People who pay to have sex with minors are child abusers not "clients."** This applies anywhere in the world. **Avoid expressions like "child sex tourism" and "child sex tourists,"** which are flippant and unsuitable descriptions of predatory assault.

The Criminal Code of Canada has included a section on human trafficking since 2005, as well as specific sections to try to deal with **child sex traffickin**g since 2014 — as outlined in the [Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gc.ca%2Feng%2Frp-pr%2Fother-autre%2Fc36fs_fi%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3Himd2Sjuh44BFv9pDwVW-) passed by Parliament that year. Be aware, however, that these crimes can be difficult for prosecutors to prove in court. So **various prostitution-related charges are sometimes laid against accused traffickers** (e.g., kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, forcible confinement, extortion, living off the avails of prostitution). **For accuracy, always report specific charges that apply in a given case.

### child\_teen

**Child, teen, young adult, etc.**

[General terms](/home/c/child_teen#child-teen-etc) (child, teen, senior, etc.)

[On the cusp caveat](/home/c/child_teen#cusp-caveat) (Avoid labels that mislead)

**Overview**

**Age ranges can be challenging to describe.** One pitfall: Applying gender-specific terms (e.g., boy, girl) to people who object to binary classifications. Another problem: Our language's inability to convey certain subtleties in a single word. Life simply isn't as straightforward as a **boy** or a **girl** suddenly becoming a **man** or a **woman**.

**The vocabulary we draw on depends on a given story's facts.** It includes **young man** and **young woman, youth, teen**, etc. The term "tween" has started to catch on to describe those in preadolescence, although it's still not instantly understood by all. **[Tween](/home/t#tween)** also packs an informal tone that's not ideal in certain coverage.

**The rest of this entry outlines common options** based on entrenched CBC News practice as well as a survey of various sources, including Statistics Canada documents, dictionaries and demographic glossaries. **It also flags potential editorial problems certain wording can cause** in some cases.


**General terms**  (child, teen, senior, etc.)

There are **no universally agreed on definitions**. Judgment is required on a case-by-case basis. But **the following guidelines provide broad direction:**


> **1 year and under** — **Baby** or **infant**. (The term "newborn" is generally reserved for those under 2 months.)
>
> **2 to 3** (roughly) — **Toddler** (Implies new to walking) or **child**, as well as **girl** or **boy**.
>
> **12 and under** — **Child** (gender neutral), as well as **girl** or **boy**.
>
> **16 and under** — **Girl** or **boy**, as well as **teenager when applicable** (older than 12).
>
> **15 to early 20s** — **Youth**. But be aware it's a vague word. "Youth" can imply people under 15 in some contexts (e.g., a 13-year-old prosecuted under Canada's [Youth Criminal Justice Act](/home/y#youthjustice)). While the United Nations defines "youth" as 15 to 24, "young adult" is usually a clearer expression for those over 18 and under 25 in Canada.
>
> **13 to 19** — **Teen** or **teenager** (but see [cusp caveat](/home/c/child_teen#cusp-caveat) below for those over 17).
>
> **18 to early 20s** — **Young people, young adults** (e.g., old enough to vote but not to drink in some jurisdictions), as well as the gender-specific nouns **man** and **woman** when applicable.
>
> **18 and over** — **Adults** (e.g., "A youth who will be tried as an adult"), although see [cusp caveat](/home/c/child_teen#cusp-caveat) below, as well as the gender-specific nouns **man** and **woman** when applicable.
>
> **65 and above** — **Senior**. Technically, Canadians can qualify for reduced Canada Pension Plan benefits as early as 60. But 65 is when Old Age Security payments begin. Be aware that some people object to being called "senior" or "senior citizen." Alternatives include **older adults, older men and women, elders, elderly people**, etc. Words like **retiree** may also be OK, depending on the facts (e.g., some people continue to work well after 65, while others leave the labour force before 50).



**On the cusp caveat**  (Avoid labels that mislead)

**Connotation carries weight. While certain terms may be technically accurate** (e.g., a 19-year-old is still a teenager), **they can also unnecessarily telegraph a different meaning out of context** (e.g., in a headline or lead paragraph).

A **common source of confusion** is **when people are on the cusp of moving from one demographic tier to another** (e.g., a young teenager, a young adult, a young senior). **In these cases, it's often best to use nuanced language.**


> **EXAMPLE 1:** In the summer of 2019, Canadian authorities launched a massive hunt for two murder suspects accused of killing three people in B.C. Early reports referred to a search for "two teens." But the **suspects were 18 and 19**. And to some people, headlines about "teenage murder suspects" implied the fugitives were younger. **In cases like this, labels such as "teen" and "teenager" are considered poor choices by many**, especially when there is no context (e.g., in a headline). **Instead, "young men" is clearer**, with specific ages reported as high up in stories as practical.
>
> **EXAMPLE 2:** The term **[child pornography](/home/c/child_pornography) has a legal meaning** in Canada. It refers to unlawful images of people under 18. **But "child" also conventionally implies those 12 and under.** In news coverage, therefore, **saying someone is accused of having "nude pictures of children" on his computer is not automatically the clearest way to report a story.** If the victims are 17 or 16, for instance, "children" is not the best choice. Alternatives such as "teens" or "youths" or "minors" or "girls/boys" (depending on known facts) would be clearer.


**Do not use the terms "[child prostitute](/home/c/child_prostitution)" and "underage prostitute,"** which are inaccurate and misleading.


**Specific ages**

In some stories, it can be **helpful to our audience to report how old people are, especially in police and court reporting**, as well as in features. Otherwise, the detail is not always relevant. Use your judgment.

**Never add an age unless you're certain it's accurate.** Bear in mind that **quick calculations based only on birth years are unreliable**. Specific months and dates are needed, too. **For this reason, ages added to obits require extra care.** In example 1 above, for instance, the younger fugitive turned 19 about a week after the search began.

Ages can be reported in various ways — e.g., in hyphenated compounds (e.g., "The 30-year-old started playing cello when he was four") to figures alone (e.g., "Kogawa, 84, was born in Vancouver"). See our [numbers overview](/home/n/numbers#ages) for typographical guidelines.


### Church

**Church versus church**

**Capitalize "church" only in names of religions and buildings:**

the _Anglican Church_, the _Roman Catholic Church_ (denominations)
_an Anglican church, a Catholic church_ (generic description of buildings)
_but St. Ansgar Lutheran Church_ (specific name of building)
the _Roman Catholic and Anglican churches_ (plural construction)
He said, _"We must keep church and state separate."_


**Keep "church" lowercase when used alone as a synonym for a specific institution:**

the _United Church's_ revitalization committee
the _church's_ revitalization committee
the schools were run by the _Catholic Church_
the schools were run by the _church_
the _Catholic Church_ opposes abortion
the Pope says the _church_ opposes abortion

**Other houses of worship
****The same rules apply to other houses of worship (halls, mosques, synagogues, etc.):**

_hall_, but _Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Hall_
_mosque_, but _Jami Mosque_
_synagogue_, but _Beth Emeth Bais Yehuda Synagogue_

**Avoid misnaming buildings** (e.g., calling a synagogue or mosque a "church"). Be aware that some religions consider a "church" a building rather than a group or community of followers. It's the reason, for example, that [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/j/#JW "J") refer to their places of worship as Kingdom Halls. 

**Use full names to avoid confusion**
**Some religions/churches have very similar names. In these cases, always spell out the full, proper nouns** if both names are being referred to in the same story or if there might otherwise be confusion.

_the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints_ ([Mormons](/home/m/mormon-mormonism)) versus the _Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints_

### CJD

**Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease**

This is the name given to **human spongiform encephalopathy**, a fatal illness characterized by [dementia](/home/d/dementia).

The abbreviation **CJD** is acceptable in news stories but it **must be defined**.

A specific type, known as **variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease** or **variant CJD**, is the form related to mad cow disease. [Do not use italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

See also [mad cow disease](/home/m/mad-cow-disease)

### climate change

**Climate change versus global warming**

There's **no doubt the planet is warming.** There's also indisputable evidence that humans have accelerated the trend. The biggest debates now are over how quickly average global temperatures will rise, how devastating the fallout will be, and what specific steps should be taken to combat climate change. It's worth noting that some people wrongly cite short-term weather fluctuations like unseasonable cold snaps to try to downplay global warming. But **weather is not the same as climate.
**
**Weather refers to local atmospheric conditions**, such as temperature, wind and humidity, **at a given moment in time.** Meteorologists predict atmospheric conditions using various statistical models. Such **weather forecasts are typically short-term** (hourly, daily, weekly). **Climate refers to statistically meaningful averages of local atmospheric conditions** (i.e., weather) **collected over many years**.

**Climate change is a broad term that refers to established shifts in normal weather patterns**, such as stronger or more frequent storms and higher or lower than seasonal temperatures. **It can be gradual** (over millions of years, based on scientific analysis of rock, glaciers, etc.), **or comparatively more sudden** (statistically measurable over mere decades). **Global warming is one type of climate change.** Ice ages are another. Shifts in the planet's temperature can be caused by natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions, or by air pollution, deforestation, etc. In modern times, **global warming conventionally refers to a slow increase in the average temperature of the Earth's surface** (air and water) **closely monitored since the 1960s.**

The **greenhouse effect** is a colloquial but acceptable label that **refers to an increase in carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.** While some greenhouse gases are natural (ozone and water vapour), others are not, or at least not in the concentrations now present. **Greenhouse gases trap heat around the planet by reflecting infrared radiation back toward the surface.** If not enough radiation is allowed to escape into space, the planet begins to warm.


**CBC News style**

-   **Climate change** and **global warming** are **fact-based default terms**, which means they always apply. They're often **used interchangeably.** This **entrenched practice is fine**. Since "global warming" implies a rise in temperature, some journalists prefer the broader label "climate change" when reporting on floods, droughts, fiercer or more frequent hurricanes, etc. But because modern climate change is often directly linked to greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect, global warming is an acceptable synonym in many stories.

-   **Climate crisis** and **climate emergency** are **OK in some cases** as synonyms for "climate change." **But they're not always the best choice, even in second reference.** For example, "climate crisis" could carry a whiff of advocacy in certain political coverage. And in stories focused on short-term disasters like flooding, words like "crisis" and "emergency" might seem better suited to the fast-rising waters that will eventually recede rather than to the creeping, long-term impact of global warming. When considered appropriate, climate crisis and climate emergency do not need to be put in quotation marks or attributed. (See [**crisis**](/home/c/crisis) for general caveats about the word.)

-   **Avoid the term denier** when referring to people who challenge some aspects of climate change research, findings, etc., unless directly attributed (i.e., in transcribed clips). [**Denier**](/home/d/denier) is not merely considered judgmental, it's also perceived as demonizing, akin to calling, say, some creationists "evolution deniers." **Prefer doubter, critic and other neutral language** that better conveys nuanced positions (e.g., someone might express doubts about projected climate change timelines, or might question/criticize how specific climate change data was collected and interpreted). **Another option is to steer clear of labels and use descriptions instead.**

-   **Be careful with expressions like "winners" and "losers"** when writing about climate change. Such language is **generally OK if stories are narrowly focused on, say, specific species**. For example, different types of penguins in Antarctica have been called global warming "winners and losers" because they rely on dissimilar habitats for their survival. (One penguin species that lives along open waters has thrived in recent decades, while another species that primarily inhabits shrinking pack ice has started to die off in significant numbers.) **But when reporting more broadly on geographical regions** (e.g., provinces, countries, hemispheres), **entire economic sectors, etc., labels such as "winners" and "losers" can be perceived as judgmental, overly simplistic and tone deaf**. Generally **avoid wording that suggests walled-off windfalls for some human beings** as the planet inches toward what scientists fear will be a less habitable state. Instead, **prefer fact-based language about specific, projected economic benefits and losses**. For instance, there's a difference between (i) stating that Canada will probably wind up with more farmland as temperatures rise and (ii) characterizing Canada as a potential "climate change winner" because of the additional farmland that's expected. To some people, the latter may appear flippant, at best, because it ignores the dire threat that global warming poses to life on Earth. In this sense, **the sheer scope and seemingly irreversible nature of climate change makes it distinct from the "winners" and "losers" traditionally associated with temporary economic shocks** like regional trade wars, unexpected production shortages and fleeting transportation disruptions.

**A few words about 'green'**
**A generation ago, using "green" to mean "pro-environment" was novel and, so, commonly defined in news stories**. It originally implied opposition to nuclear power stations, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. This use of "green" was coined in West Germany in the early 1970s — most notably with the _Grüne Aktion Zukunft_ (Green Campaign for the Future), and the _Grüne Listen_ (green lists) of election candidates. In North America, meanwhile, the organization Greenpeace was formed around the same time because of concerns over the U.S. military's plan to test nuclear weapons near Alaska.

Within a few years, the colour "green" expanded from relatively narrow concerns about nuclear energy and nuclear weapons to general efforts to protect the planet from pollution, deforestation, overfishing and other threats to ecosystems. This modern sense of the word is **instantly recognized by our audience now**, from generic uses (**green power, greener energy, a green plan**) to proper nouns (the **Green Party**).

### cockpit versus flight deck

**Cockpit versus flight deck**

**Prefer the term _cockpit_ over _flight deck_.** Avoid using _flight deck_ unless the story's context makes the meaning immediately clear.

There are two reasons:

**1\. Our audience instantly understands what we mean by cockpit.** _Flight deck_, on the other hand, is not nearly as well known outside the aviation industry. The term could suggest anything from a waiting area on the tarmac (where planes are "on deck") to a viewing space atop the control tower.

**2\. The common word _cockpit_ is easier for our journalists.** It can be conventionally used to describe any aircraft's flight control area. By contrast, the industry jargon "flight deck" generally applies to larger planes only. Referring to a two-seat jet's "flight deck," for example, is absurd.

### Commission, committee, subcommittee

**Commission versus commission, committee, subcommittee**

**Commission
****Capitalize the generic word "commission" in the proper names of government and royal commissions:**

_Canadian Transport Commission
the 1902 Royal Commission on Chinese and Japanese Immigration
the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada
the Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada_

**This applies to compound nouns featuring the commissioner's name:**

_the Krever Commission (into Canada's blood system)
the Romanow Commission (into the future of health care)_


**commission**
**But keep "commission" lowercase for more general references:**

_the transport commission_
_a royal commission into immigration_
_a federal commission into the tainted blood scandal_
_the health-care commission_

**committee, subcommittee**
**Do not capitalize the names of legislative committees or subcommittees:**

_a House of Commons committee
the Commons finance committee
the access to information and ethics committee
a Senate committee
the Senate energy and environment committee
the Senate subcommittee on cities
the U.S. congressional subcommittee on water resources and the environment_

**This applies even in rare cases when long, formal committee names are used:**

_the House of Commons standing committee on finance
the Canadian Senate standing committee on energy, the environment and natural resources
the U.S. House of Representatives transportation subcommittee on water resources and the environment
_

### comprise

**Comprise**

To purists, **_comprise_ is simply a fancy way of saying _contain_ or _include_**. It does not mean compose, which deals with formation or creation.

**Parts form the whole** (e.g., "Brass is composed of copper and zinc"). **The whole comprises parts** (e.g., "The small petting zoo comprises goats, lambs, pigs and a variety of fowl"). But individual components never comprise anything. And **nothing is "comprised of" or "contained of" or "included of" anything.**

Although English is evolving, **CBC News prefers to limit _comprise_ to its original meaning — especially since more conversational** and less controversial **options are available, such as _contain_ or _made up of_.**

**
Disputed usage (avoid)**
In 1969, the committee was **comprised of** a dozen Liberals, four Tories and a New Democrat.

**Undisputed (but lofty) usage**
In 1969, the committee **comprised** a dozen Liberals, four Tories and a New Democrat.

**Conversational alternative (preferred)**
In 1969, the committee was **made up of** a dozen Liberals, four Tories and a New Democrat.

The word **include**, by the way, generally suggests that a list is incomplete. In the above example, then, it would be misleading to write: "In 1969, the committee included a dozen Liberals, four Tories and a New Democrat" unless you intended to imply that members of some other (unmentioned) political party were also members.

### confirmed\_presumptive\_tests

**Confirmed versus presumptive medical cases**

In epidemiology, **doctors routinely distinguish between people who appear to have an infection**, disease, etc., **and those who definitely have it.
**
We should **be as clear as possible in tallies, especially when covering [epidemics and pandemics](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic)**[](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic). such as **[COVID-19](/home/c/coronavirus#novelcoronavirus)**. There's **no need to get bogged down in jargon** (e.g., "presumptive positive"). **But avoid muddling unique labels like "confirmed" and "probable"** **under the single heading of "new" cases**, which can wrongly imply "verified." When covering domestic outbreaks, **it's a good idea to ask local or provincial health authorities to explain the language they're using**.

Here are **some common labels:**


**confirmed cases —** **Verified by a standard lab test**. In most news stories, no other information is required. Be aware that **health officials sometimes distinguish between "confirmed" results from a central testing site** like Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg **and "[presumptive positive](/home/c/confirmed_presumptive_tests#presumptive)" results from initial, local tests**, especially in the case of new or highly virulent pathogens. **At the start of an outbreak, local tests may not be available**. And even as an outbreak spreads, **not all regions may be equipped to run tests quickly or reliably.**


**people under investigation (PUI) —** This is **a potentially confusing category**. It **often means people who are being monitored and/or tested**. It can also include patients who have tested negative — not because the negative results are in doubt but simply to distinguish individuals who've been tested from those who haven't been tested within a given population. **Whenever practical, get a breakdown of relevant numbers and then use straightforward descriptions** (e.g., "Roughly 5,000 people have been tested"). **Generally avoid PUI and other obscure abbreviations**, especially in broadcast scripts.


**possible cases —** Normally **suggests far less certainty than "probable"** (e.g., no symptoms, only indirect exposure to someone infected). **People in this category might be asked to [self-quarantine](/home/q#quarantine)** for a specific period of time to reduce risk to others, but they won't necessarily be tested unless they start developing certain symptoms.


**probable cases —** Traditionally **less precise than "presumptive positive" cases** (see below). **"Probable" generally implies a high likelihood of a given infection, disease, etc., based on symptoms, a person's recent history** (e.g.. logged travel, known exposure to people who are ill), etc. In news stories, it's important to distinguish between confirmed cases and probable cases.


**presumptive positive —** **OK to shorten to "presumptive" as long as the meaning is clear** from context. **"Presumptive positive" usually implies that a local lab test has been conducted** and that the initial results suggest the person has a given infection, disease, etc. **Under testing protocols for new or for known but highly virulent pathogens, samples are sometimes sent to a designated central lab for verification before cases are officially classified as "confirmed."** This can lead to preliminary totals changing if the second lab's results come back negative. The key takeaway is that **a "presumptive positive" result may turn out not to be a new case**, depending on whether additional testing is done. During epidemics and pandemics, when the number of patients worldwide can surge into the thousands relatively quickly, the importance of these distinctions is magnified.

### Congos

**Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville**

**There's more than one Congo**, which can make writing about this part of Africa confusing.

Zaire changed its name to the **Democratic Republic of Congo** in 1997. We commonly call it **Congo** (_not_ "the" Congo), based on entrenched convention.

A smaller neighbouring country became **the Republic of Congo** in 1992. (It used to be called "the People's Republic of Congo.") We call it "the Republic of Congo."

Since the two official names are now almost identical, it's easiest to **adopt the local custom of incorporating the name of the capital city after a hyphen in second reference:
**
**Congo**, also known as **Congo-Kinshasa ...**

**The Republic of Congo**, also known as **Congo-Brazzaville ...**

If you're writing about only one of them, you can then drop the reference to the capital city and simply call it "Congo" (not "the Congo") after that.

But if you're writing about both countries, keep using the hyphenated names. In this case, it's also helpful to mention that Congo-Kinshasa was formerly known as Zaire.

### congress

**U.S. Congress**

The **United States Congress** is made up of two bodies: the **House of Representatives** and the **Senate**. The abbreviated form **U.S. Congress** is fine in first reference. **Congress** is OK after that.

**In titles, use capital letters only before names**:


> congressman, congresswoman, congressional
> **Sen.** Frank Mills; Mills, a U.S. **senator** ...
> **Rep.** Cheryl Woods; Woods, a **representative** in the U.S. Congress ...


While it's common and OK to abbreviate the above titles before names, be aware that _Rep._ can be easily confused as shorthand for _Republican_. For this reason, **it's generally helpful to identify a person's political affiliation in stories**:


> **Republican Rep.** Hal Rogers
> **Democratic Sen.** Jay Rockefeller
> **Sen.** Bernie Sanders is an **Independent** from Vermont


There are **many acceptable ways to introduce details like party affiliation or geographical connections**. Common options include:


> **U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** (with U.S. optional, depending if the context is already obvious)
>
> **New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** (one of many ways to introduce specific geographical detail)
>
> **Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** (with "Democratic" optional)
>
> **Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** (acceptable in many cases)
>
> **U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes** (with U.S. optional, depending if the context is already obvious)
>
> **Calif. Rep. Devin Nunes** (one of many ways to introduce specific geographical detail)
>
> **Republican Rep. Devin Nunes** (with "Republican" optional)
>
> **Rep. Devin Nunes** (acceptable in many cases)
>
> **U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren** (with U.S. optional, depending if the context is already obvious)
>
> **Mass. Sen. Elizabeth Warren** (one of many ways to introduce specific geographical detail)
>
> **Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren** (with "Democratic" optional)
>
> **Sen. Elizabeth Warren** (acceptable in many cases)
>
> **U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham** (with U.S. optional, depending if the context is already obvious)
>
> **South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham** (one of many ways to introduce a specific geographical detail)
>
> **Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham** (with "Republican" optional)
>
> **Sen. Lindsey Graham** (acceptable in many cases)


**Party affiliation is also optional when referring to the majority and minority leaders in Congress**, depending on what's already obvious from the context of a given story:


> **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi**
>
> Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
>
>
>
> **House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy**
>
> Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
>
>
>
> **Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell**
>
> Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
>
>
>
> **Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer**
>
> Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer


**the Capitol, Capitol Hill**
The official building of the U.S. Congress is known as **the Capitol**. It's on **Capitol Hill** in Washington, D.C. The Capitol has two sections: The **Senate**, in the north wing, has 100 members (two from each state, regardless of size). **The House of Representatives**, in the south wing, has 435 members (with the number from each state based on its population).

When the House of Representatives and the Senate meet for special sessions, such as the [state of the union address](/home/s/state-of-the-union), it's known as a "joint session of Congress."

In many ways, mentioning the U.S. Congress in a story is comparable to using the term "Parliament" in Canada, which refers to both the House of Commons and the Senate. There are significant differences, of course. For example: **In the U.S., the executive branch of government** (the White House) **is separate from the legislative branch. In Canada, it's not**. (The government is made up of MPs — the prime minister and the rest of cabinet.)


**capitol, capital**
The term **capitol** (lowercase) is sometimes used to mean legislatures in many, but not all, states.


> South Dakota's governor made the announcement at the state capitol building.


The word **capital** (lowercase) refers to the seat of government in a country, province, state or other region:


> Canada’s capital is Ottawa, where Pierre Trudeau once lived.
>
> South Dakota’s capital is Pierre, but it’s not clear if Trudeau spent any time there.

### constitution

**Constitution versus constitution**

**Use a capital "C" in all references to the _Canadian Constitution_** (e.g., _the Constitution, Canada's Constitution_).

**For other country's constitutions, use a capital "C" only when the word is also used there and it's linked directly to the nation's name** (the _U.S. Constitution_, the _French Constitution_, but "_France plans to amend its constitution._")

**Keep lowercase when it's merely a translation** (_China's constitution_).

**Keep lowercase when referring to the constitutions of unions, clubs, etc.**

**Derivatives are always lowercase** (e.g., constitutional, constitutionally), **even in Canada**: "_They plan a constitutional challenge_," "_Ottawa says it wants to avoid another constitutional crisis,_" etc.

### controversial-team-names

**Controversial team names** (Indians, Eskimos, etc.)

It's **normally OK to use a controversial sports team name once in a story FOCUSED on the proper noun** (e.g., the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Cleveland Indians, the Chicago Blackhawks), to ensure clarity. **But there's no need to use such names in other routine coverage** of wins/losses, championship games, player trades, etc., as long as relevant geographical detail and other context is included. **For example, phrasing such as "the Blue Jays beat Cleveland" was sufficient until the latter franchise formally changed its name to the Guardians** in the fall of 2021, and **references to "Chicago's NHL team" were adequate when allegations of sexual abuse surfaced** against a former video coach.

Even when there's editorial reason to use a widely denounced name, **always exercise restraint** in accordance with the principle of respect enshrined in our Journalistic Standards and Practices policy. In particular, **avoid using the name in headlines**, and **avoid repeating the name throughout a story**. Whenever practical, it's a good idea to **add background about why a given name is considered hurtful and inappropriate as a franchise name** if the language, itself, may not be automatically offensive in certain other contexts.

This approach **also applies to historical references to abandoned franchise names**, such as the [Edmonton Eskimos](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk), a football team called the **Edmonton Elks** since the spring of 2021. There's no reason to use the old name in routine coverage of the Elks.

**Take the direct quotes of others into account** when assessing the impact of names on our audience — i.e., whether people interviewed have used the controversial word(s) in a clip or transcribed quote. In those cases, **there may be no need to add additional references to the proper noun** in a broadcast script or online article.

And **always consider alternative wording** if there's no ambiguity or loss of meaning. For example, compare these approaches to a story about Washington's NFL franchise that officially became the Commanders in 2022:


> ORIGINAL: _The team was known as **the Redskins** for more than 80 years._
>
> REWRITE: _The team's name was a **derogatory reference to the skin colour of Indigenous people** for more than 80 years._



**NOTE:** CBC News recognizes that there is no consensus on how to report on the controversial names of sports teams. As pointed out in a [July 2020 Language Guide update](/updates/2020/2020-07-20) as well as in a [companion iNEWS memo](https://sites.google.com/a/cbc.ca/cbc-news-journalism-portal/home/news/jsp---sports-team-note): We are committed to an on-going review of our current guidelines, revising when appropriate.

### coronavirus


**Coronavirus**


[Coronavirus disease](/home/c/coronavirus#COVID) (COVID)

[Covering recovery](/home/c/coronavirus#recovery) (vaccines, etc.)
[Miscellaneous](/home/c/coronavirus#CDC) (CDC, WHO)


**Overview**
**Coronavirus is an umbrella term** for various mild to severe microscopic germs that can cause **everything from the common cold to deadly respiratory illnesses**. First identified in the 1960s, the coronavirus was named for its crown-shaped ("corona") visible under electron microscopes.

There are **several types of coronaviruses**. Some are spread only from animal to animal, while others can be transmitted from animals to people. Within each family, there are different strains, and these, in turn, can mutate over time.

**In coverage of severe outbreaks, it's helpful to point out that standard virulence measurements may change** (e.g., mortality rates, transmission risks and rates) as more data is compiled and assessed. **Be clear about what is known or unknown**, attributing as required. And **be cautious before using words like [epidemic and pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic)** unless it's clear the terms apply.


**Novel coronavirus**
If a **new strain** is identified, it's common to hear experts refer to it as a **"novel" coronavirus**. When a coronavirus is initially assigned a name, the **standard short form is "CoV"** along with the year the first case was recorded (e.g., 2019-nCoV). **Be aware that virused may subsequently be renamed** as more data is collected and assessed (e.g., "2019-nCoV" officially became **SARS-CoV-2** in February 2020).

It's **OK to use generic wording** (e.g., "the coronavirus outbreak") **rather than dense, technical labels for specific viruses, as long as a given story's context makes the meaning clear**. In the case of national or global health threats, our audience will probably know what we're talking about pretty quickly. At other times, however, extra detail will be required. **Use your judgment**, but avoid the pitfall of assuming that the word "coronavirus" automatically provides a sufficient degree of precision.

**Whenever practical, it's a good idea to supply brief, relevant background to help distinguish one coronavirus from another** (e.g., where and when it was first recorded). **But avoid incorporating geographical detail into virus or disease names, themselves** (e.g., **do not talk about the "China coronavirus" or the "Wuhan coronavirus"**). This applies to mutations. For example, it's OK to refer to "a coronavirus variant first reported in the U.K.," but **avoid shorthand like "the U.K. variant" or "the South Africa variant."** See COVID below for related options.


**Coronavirus disease (COVID)**
In February 2020, the World Health Organization adopted a new **format for naming respiratory illnesses caused by novel coronavirus outbreaks: COVID** (pronounced "coh-vid"). It stands for "corona" (CO) "virus" (VI) "disease (D). The year the first case is reported is added after a hyphen (e.g., COVID-19, which was first documented in China in the fall of 2019). This format will be a template for naming future coronavirus outbreaks, according to officials. Among other things, it lets them discuss specific illnesses without relying on geographical detail (e.g., the "Wuhan virus" or "the China virus"), which can stigmatize people.

**WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March of 2020**, based on confirmed cases in different parts of the world, as well as sustained or growing transmission rates between humans. Three years later, **in May of 2023, the organization announced that the spreading and mutating COVID-19 virus was no longer a global health emergency**, based on decreased death tolls and hospitalization rates, as well as effective vaccination programs that made managing the ongoing disease possible. **But the pandemic, itself, was not deemed over.** Indeed, many leading infectious disease experts have repeatedly warned that vigilance will be required for the foreseeable future, and that COVID-19, itself, would unlikely ever be eradicated.

**Although we're not required to use formal names like COVID-19 in scripts, such acronyms can be a convenient way of identifying specific global health threats** in stories, as long as the terms are briefly explained until they become commonplace (e.g., we initially said "known as COVID-19" until the noun caught on a few weeks later).

**Avoid calling COVID a "virus."** It's not, just as SARS was not. **COVID is the respiratory illness people get after becoming infected**. It's **OK to use COVID as a modifier** (e.g., "the COVID-19 virus" instead of "SARS-CoV-2"), **just as [SARS](/home/s/sars) and [AIDS](/home/a/aids) can be used as modifiers** (e.g., "the SARS virus" and "the AIDS virus"). **But steer clear of stating or implying that COVID-19 on its own is the name of a virus**, which is inaccurate. Examples:


> _To prevent the spread of COVID-19_ ...     (CORRECT)
> _They've contracted COVID-19_.         (CORRECT)
> _Another case of COVID-19_ ... (CORRECT)
> _The COVID-19 virus is_ ...     (CORRECT because the disease name is a modifier that identifies a specific virus, just like the "smallpox virus")
>
> _The virus, known as COVID-19, is_ ...     (**WRONG**)
> _COVID-19 can live on surfaces_ ...     (**WRONG**)


**KEY TAKEAWAY: Diseases spread. People contract diseases. But diseases aren't viruses, don't cling to surfaces, etc.** If you're uncertain whether using COVID-19 is acceptable in a given sentence, substitute another disease name to see if it makes sense (e.g., measles, Ebola, AIDS). As noted above, **conversational alternatives like "the coronavirus" are often sufficient in stories, especially in second reference**, as long as the term's meaning is clear from context.


**TYPOGRAPHY:** For web writers in particular, the all-caps abbreviation "**COVI**" initially required adjustment, since "**CoV**" has typically been used in the past to mean "coronavirus" (e.g., **SARS-CoV** and **MERS-CoV**). The explanation from WHO officials? COVID-19 refers to a specific "disease" (D) rather than to a "respiratory syndrome" (RS). Such minutia is largely irrelevant in broadcast journalism, with the exception of some TV graphics. But **if you're actually incorporating this level of detail into your journalism, follow established publishing norms** (e.g., "SARS-CoV-2" but "COVID-19").



**Virus variations**
**Viruses commonly mutate during an outbreak**, which may or may not affect transmissibility, illness severity, mortality or a specific vaccination's effectiveness. The names of diseases often stay the same, regardless of virus variations. For instance, there were three distinct types of known, "wild" (naturally occurring) polio viruses in the world in 2018, according to the World Health Organization: Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) and wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3). While three different vaccinations needed to be combined into a single treatment in order to try to eradicate the health threat, the disease, itself, has been called "polio," regardless. So **generally prefer constructions like "COVID virus variants" or "coronavirus variants" over "COVID variants" to reflect that the virus (not the disease) is mutating.** While occasional second-reference shorthand to "COVID-19 variants" can be acceptable in a broadcast story as long as the meaning is clear from context, it's better to use the modifier "virus" as our default in our coverage of mutations (**e.g., prefer a TV banner like VIRUS VARIANTS**).

It's **OK to report where and when a new variant surfaced** (e.g., "in South Africa a month ago"). **But steer clear of geographical shorthand when naming mutations** (e.g., prefer "a new coronavirus variant" or "what appears to be a more contagious variant," depending on the facts, rather than "the U.K. variant"). **Including the official names of virus mutations in stories is optional** (e.g., B.1.1.7 and B.1.351). Keep in mind, however, that too many alphanumeric designations can be difficult to digest in TV and radio scripts. Instead, **it's often sufficient to keep wording relatively generic**, depending on the story. NOTE: In late May 2021, [the World Health Organization adopted Greek names for specific COVID-19 virus variants of concern](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fen%2Factivities%2Ftracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw24XU1z7AYm2uV2TGBGdDJm) (e.g., **Alpha** for B.1.1.7, and **Beta** for B.1.351). **Using words like Alpha and Beta and Omicron as the default name can help keep writing tighter and avoid editorial problems associated with geographical-based designations.** Until new labels like this catch on widely, however, it's a good practice to either report both names in stories when practical (e.g., "the Alpha variant, also known as B.1.1.7") or to define/explain clearly (e.g., "the Beta variant, first reported in South Africa"). Use your own judgment. **Variant mutations are commonly called subvariants or offshoots** (e.g., "an Omicron subvariant").  **It's generally OK to call a significant virus mutation a new [strain](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus#virus)** AS LONG AS health authorities are also using the term.

**Avoid using informal nicknames** (e.g., the Kraken, Minotaur, Centaurus and other fanciful monikers) **outside of direct attribution** (i.e., a broadcast clip or transcribed web quote). Such unofficial labels are arbitrary, sensational, imprecise and potentially misleading (e.g., a given virus mutation assigned the name of a particularly fearsome mythical creature may turn out to be far less virulent than first assumed). For details, see the January 2023 Language Guide update: [Avoid COVID nicknames like 'the Kraken](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2023/2023-01-17/ "2023 01 17").'


**TYPOGRAPHY: Follow the punctuation used by the World Health Organization when reporting alphanumeric names assigned to variants** — assuming such dense labels are deemed editorially necessary. Not all figures are followed by periods (e.g., **B.1.1.7** but **B.1.351** and **B.1.617.2**). The designations combine data on genome sequencing, geography, chronology, etc., based on nomenclature rules used by Pango lineages software. (Pango stands for Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak, but this arcane detail is virtually never mentioned, let alone spelled out, in stories.) Be aware that many news organizations initially fused Pango names (e.g., "B117") in late 2020 and early 2021, based on past publishing conventions. However, there was a gradual shift to verbatim renderings of the scientific labels. CBC News officially adopted this style in June of 2021.



**Covering recovery**
The word **"recovered" is commonly used by public health officials to describe people** who've previously tested positive for the COVID-19 virus but **who are no longer ill** (assuming they had noticeable symptoms) **and who are no longer considered contagious** based on locally set criteria (e.g., one or more negative tests and/or the passage of a specific quarantine period). **"Recovered" is generally a good choice** when the facts fit. A participle like **"recovering" might be a more appropriate choice in cases when people experience serious, lingering health problems** for months. The term **"survivor" implies a close brush with death and, so, is usually best reserved for COVID-19 patients who were not only hospitalized but extremely ill** (e.g., in intensive care, intubated). Novel coronaviruses are, by definition, initially unfamiliar. As more data is collected and analyzed, be clear with our audience about what is known/unknown about people's immunity after recovery, about the risk of reinfection, etc.

It's OK to use the expression **COVID-19 vaccine**, even though the vaccine is technically targeting the virus rather than the disease, just as it's common to refer to a polio vaccine, a smallpox vaccine, etc. When reporting on vaccinations, **be clear if treatment requires more than one dose and use whatever qualifying language applies** (e.g., differentiate between the total number of doses administered and the number of people who've been either "partially" or "completely" vaccinated within a country or region's population). Whenever practical, include rudimentary efficacy background (e.g., whether it's known how long the vaccination is expected to last).

**Be clear and accurate when referring to vaccines.** If they've been jointly developed by two or more companies, generally acknowledge this at least once in first reference (e.g., the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine rather than just the "Pfizer vaccine" in headlines and leads). Be aware that vaccine names sometimes undergo rebrandings. See [vaccination](/home/i/immunization-vaccination) for examples and guidelines.


**U.S. Centers for Disease Control**
Technically, it’s the "**U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**," although it's **common (and acceptable) to shorten this to "U.S. Centers for Disease Control." CDC is fine in second reference**. Note that Centers is plural, and "er" not "re." (We generally use American spellings of proper nouns in the U.S., such as World Trade Center, except in the case of government departments, such as [Labour, not Labor, and Defence, not Defense](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre)).


**WHO, rarely the WHO**
**Although "WHO" stands for World Health Organization, we do not routinely put an article in front of it.** If it's an adjective, "the" is not automatically added (WHO representative, WHO official, WHO advisory, etc.) "The" can usually be left out of web headlines, too. CP, AP and others have been inconsistent with their use of "the" before WHO functioning as a noun in the main body of stories. **CBC News does not write "the NATO" or "the OPEC" or "the NASA." We rarely have to write "the WHO" either** because it's also an acronym (e.g., "Canadian officials are demanding WHO change its mind.") **Be aware, however, that WHO on its own can sometimes sound more like a pronoun** ("who") **than an abbreviation in broadcast scripts. Adding "the" in those cases is OK.** Using a synonym like "the organization" or "the UN body" is another effective option.

### corporation

**Corp. versus Corporation**

Corp. can be used for "Corporation" in business stories or in highly formal contexts (e.g., in a story about a lawsuit that demands specific identification of the parties).

But in general, follow common usage. For example, write either **Canadian Tire** (_instead of_ using its complete name, **Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd.**), or **Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation** (with "Corp." spelled out in full) depending on how the nouns are widely known.

Reference to "Corporation" is sometimes dropped from abbreviations (e.g., the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation becomes the OLG not the OLGC). Often, however, it's retained as a central component of the proper noun. For instance, the **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation** and the **British Broadcasting Corporation** (not Corp.) are referred to as "the CBC" and "the BBC" — usually without being spelled out in first reference because the short forms are so well known.

In a few cases, the clipped term "Corp." loses its period and becomes fused to another word based on common usage, such as PotashCorp, which has become the preferred way to refer to the **Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan** in second reference.

**Overview**
**To help maintain the credibility of the CBC's entire news service, WE ALWAYS:**

-   **Strive to report accurately.**
-   **Fix mistakes** in our online journalism as quickly as possible.

This is an obligation, not an option. Since online journalism is archived in a way that broadcast material is not, news staff must take steps to correct editorial flaws on our website once they're aware of them, in accordance with these guidelines. If they're not sure what to do in any given case, they should talk to their supervisor.

**When correcting published content, WE SOMETIMES:**

-   **Flag changes by cataloguing them in a "corrections and clarifications" section** of our website (i.e., edits that merit public acknowledgment, as defined under [criteria for logging](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#criterialogging) below).
-   **Highlight the revisions in a box** at the bottom of the story.

**The key consideration is whether readers have been misled** (i.e., if they've probably drawn false conclusions based on the original wording that would leave them with an inaccurate understanding of the story).

**Most minor slips** in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, grammar, etc., and small ambiguities that are simply confusing, **can be corrected without alerting readers.**

The [date/time stamps](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#criteriaaltering) at the top of articles are not changed when typos are fixed or other minor corrections are published.

**Entire stories are deleted from our server only under certain conditions**, as specified in a separate policy on [permanently removing editorial content](https://docs.google.com/a/radio-canada.ca/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2JjLmNhfGxhbmd1YWdlZ3VpZGV8Z3g6MWRmMTdlMmI4M2YzZDI4Ng) from CBC.ca.

**The guidelines below outline the general principles and process for posting corrections on CBCNews.ca. They're intended to offer practical direction in day-to-day decision making as we adhere to the corporation's [Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on corrections](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fcorrections-corrections-et-clarifications-1.4523122&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1hBNc8o5buNxIeXY0ZLLPh).**


**What we correct**
**We fix all inaccuracies and clarify anything that could reasonably mislead readers, including mixed-up photographs and botched captions.**

But flaws in stories fall across a spectrum. Some are obvious while others are debatable. Some are minor while others can lead to readers drawing the wrong conclusions, lawyers demanding apologies, etc.

For this reason, **revisions are handled in a variety of ways**. So while all discovered mistakes and ambiguities are righted, not all changes are acknowledged through correction notices. (Details can be found in the next section, "How we correct.")

**This Language Guide entry is primarily aimed at text and still images on the web. It does not cover revisions to the television "crawl"** — the brief summaries that move across the bottom of the TV screen during some programs.

**We also do not publish corrections or clarifications about the content of radio or television reports**, unless we have repeated a broadcast item's mistake in a web story (i.e., by incorporating misleading text).

**We may decide to strip audio or video off our website, however**, if a senior CBCNews.ca journalist feels that the recorded content contains an error beyond the equivalent of a typo or mispronunciation. In these cases, the deletion protocols mentioned above apply.


**How we correct**
We fix all problems to the best of our ability, but **we don't publicly log every typo or other minor slip.**


**Criteria for logging**
**We always acknowledge changes to stories** in our corrections and clarifications section **when instructed to do so by our legal department.**

**Otherwise, we generally highlight revisions only if** both of the following two conditions are met:

1.  **Readers could not be reasonably expected to recognize the blunder or inconsistency themselves.** (For instance, if we misspelled Pierre Elliott Trudeau's middle name or published a map that referred to Mumbai as Bombay, a correction notice would **not** be required.)


2.  **The original mistake or ambiguity could _mislead_ readers** (e.g., _change the meaning_ of the text or _skew the interpretation_ of the photographs in question).
    In these cases, we clearly summarize the revision or revisions by publishing the date and details in a box at the bottom of each altered article.

For direction on judging whether readers have been misled, see "[Three categories of mistakes](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#3categories)" below.

**How much time has passed between initial publication and revision (e.g., five seconds versus five hours) is irrelevant when deciding whether to publish a correction.** Given the nature of cached files on the web, a published error should be considered a published error — regardless of how quickly it is fixed.

This principle reinforces the serious responsibility associated with posting any content on CBC.ca. As with broadcasting, electronic publishing must not be approached lightly, with the cavalier and unacceptable attitude that mistakes can be quickly fixed later without anyone knowing.


**Flash-based interactive files, etc.**
**When fixing photo galleries, interactive maps, etc., it's sufficient to publicly acknowledge revisions on our site's central corrections and clarifications page only.** We do not need to add corrections boxes to Flash-based formats. The same approach it is taken with alerts, which cannot be revised after being issued through mass emailings and other delivery mechanisms.

**CBC.ca-generated podcasts, or any non-text-based content we produce that cannot be easily fixed after being published, are handled in a similar fashion.** Mistakes that would normally be flagged if they were in the form of text must be acknowledged on the main corrections and clarifications page. But we do not need to attach a correction notice to such CBC.ca-produced audio/video files (e.g., in the form of a pop-up window).

Of course, in addition to flagging the flaw on the central corrections and clarifications page, we may decide to permanently remove the podcast or other offending material from our website, according to the formal deletion protocols cited in the overview above.


**Criteria for altering date/time stamps**
The purpose of our date/time stamp is to let readers know when an article was first published, and when new information was last added or old information last updated. It's not intended to record every corrected typo, every broken link that's been repaired, etc.

**We revise a "current" story's date/time stamp only when fixing mistakes that change the meaning of an article.** "Current" is defined as less than 24 hours old.

**We virtually never revise an "archived" story's date/time stamp because these are not true "updates" of current coverage.** We do, however, make it clear to our readers that we have fixed a significant mistake in an archived story by publishing the date and brief details of a correction in a box at the bottom of the article. "Archived" is defined as more than 24 hours old. (For more details, see [archived stories below](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#changing).)


**Three categories of mistakes**
This section illustrates how the above policy is applied in practice.

When deciding how to handle corrections and clarifications, **we first determine which of three broad categories the flaws fall into:**


**Level 1 flaw (Most typos and stylistic inconsistencies)**

**Examples**: Accidentally typing "thier" or even "there" instead of "their," dropping the "s" in U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, failing to use a CBC.ca preferred spelling when more than one option exists (e.g., wrongly picking "advisor" instead of adviser), mixing up the names of the Great Lakes in a map, and inconsistently using capitalization, French accents, etc.

Such mistakes are undesirable and can even be quite embarrassing, but they have no potential to mislead readers. **Level 1 Flaws do not need to be publicly logged** (i.e., published in a box at the bottom of the article), even when the gaffe is high-profile (e.g., "pubic" instead of "public" schools in a headline or lead).

When stories are fixed this way, **the date/time stamps do not need to be changed**. This is the equivalent of a newspaper replating a page on the fly, as the presses roll out the first edition, or a national TV unit replacing a bad shot in an item before it's broadcast in the next time zone.


**Level 2 flaw (A seemingly minor error that might mislead)**

**Examples**: Misspelling one MP's name in such a way that the person could be confused with another MP, or implying that a photograph is more recent than it really is.

Normally, fixed typos and the like do not need to be logged. But in cases **when the mistake might mislead people, the change should be flagged on the corrections page as well as in a box at the bottom of the article.**

For example, spelling MP Sherri McDonald as Sherry Macdonald would normally be a Level 1 flaw. But under certain conditions it might be elevated to a Level 2 (e.g., if there happened to be someone with a similar name, such as an MP called Shirley Macdonald, who could be easily confused for the person we intended to identify in our original coverage).

And if the date is missing from an old photo that's been republished in a fresh story, readers might draw the wrong conclusion about what they assume is a recent image (e.g., a stock picture of boats legally setting lobster traps in season added to a story about fishermen threatening to set traps out of season). If, on the other hand, the missing date would probably not cause anyone to misinterpret the image, the incomplete information could simply be treated as a Level 1 flaw, and the detail could be added to the caption without flagging the clarification.

**Deciding whether to publicize this type of correction or clarification requires a ruling by a senior online journalist** — usually the person in charge of the web space where the content was originally published. At least one senior producer should be notified of all Level 2 flaws, and participate in the decision-making process about whether to acknowledge the edit.

**When stories are fixed in this way, the date/time stamps do not need to be changed.** If it's felt that the old version might have misled readers, however, **a separate corrections box outlining the date and details of the change should be included at the bottom of the article**, in addition to being noted on the corrections page.


**Level 3 flaw (An error that either does mislead or could easily mislead)**

**Examples**: Stating that a study was published by Heritage Canada (a charitable foundation) instead of Canadian Heritage (a federal government department), transposing two numbers in a budget figure ($398 million instead of $938 million), or dropping the word "not" before "guilty" in an acquittal we initially report as a conviction.

**Such errors in fact are virtually always acknowledged, although the final ruling rests with a senior online journalist** (usually the person in charge of the web space where the content was originally published). The key consideration is whether readers have been misled. Normally, a managing editor or executive producer participates in the decision-making process about whether to acknowledge the edit. At the very least, a senior producer is involved.

**When "current" stories** (less than 24 hours old) **are fixed in this way, the date/time stamps are normally changed** because the revision adds new/different information.

**A separate corrections box outlining the date and details of the change, should generally be included at the bottom of the altered article**.

**Level 1 flaws** are the easiest to handle (i.e., fix the mistake but don't advertise the change) because it's clear that readers have not been misled.

**Level 2 flaws** are in some ways the trickiest because it's not immediately obvious whether readers have been misled.
**Level 3 flaws** tend to be the clearest (and often the most serious) botch-ups.


**Updates versus corrections**
**It is crucial to distinguish between evolving details and mistakes.** For example, reporting an Al Jazeera claim that some Canadian soldiers had been taken hostage in Afghanistan would NOT constitute a CBC.ca error if Al Jazeera's story ended up being wrong — as long as our initial article was clearly attributed.

If it turned out that no Canadian soldiers were taken hostage, we would simply post an updated version of the story pointing out that Ottawa had denied Al Jazeera's bogus report.

Of course, information such as the original Al Jazeera claim should never be posted by us if we have any reason to believe it's false at the time of publication. See [Wire copy on CBC.ca](/home/w/wire-copy) for relevant rules governing the use of other news organizations' material in our journalism.


**Authorizing correction notices**
All CBCNews.ca staff involved in publishing a story can fix errors or clarify ambiguity in the article as part of their normal working routine — as long as these revisions are sent through the central copy desk. But **all substantive corrections to articles already published** (i.e., beyond minor typos) **must be brought to the attention of the senior digital journalist (executive producer or higher)** in charge of that web space.

If the CBC's Legal Department directs us to publish a correction, we will comply immediately.

In all other cases, decisions are based on criteria in the guidelines already outlined above.

**When ruling on debatable cases, we should generally lean toward publicly acknowledging errors** unless there's strong reason to believe the average reader has not been misled (i.e., that the slip is a Level 1 flaw).

**If there's disagreement over whether a correction is warranted, the final decision will be made by the managing editor of digital news** — who will then notify relevant staff.


**Wording of corrections**
The online employee closest to the story (i.e., the person who wrote the original article) should generally be asked to compose the first draft — assuming they're still on duty and available.

In the case of controversial or highly sensitive corrections, the senior or executive producer in charge of a particular unit must be asked for input.

**CBCNews.ca prefers specific corrections and clarifications rather than vague ones** (e.g., we usually avoid the clichéd reference to "different information" being previously published).


**Typical wording on the corrections and clarifications page:**

> April 15, 2002 
>
> A story about panhandling in southern Alberta published April 14 said that Lethbridge police arrested four people in a downtown park. In fact, the police removed four people from the park but did not detain them. 
>
> » Read the story

**Typical wording at the bottom of the story itself:**


 **CORRECTION**

 We initially reported that Lethbridge police arrested four people in the park. In fact, the police removed all four people from the park but did not detain them.

 Posted: April 15, 2002 | 11:55 a.m. ET


**Less specific corrections should be used, however, if there are legal reasons** to avoid repeating the original wording, **or if it makes more editorial sense to use vague language** (e.g., if repeating the original error would unnecessarily confuse or offend readers).

All of our notices should be brief, unambiguous and neutral. We must not use this forum to take shots at anyone. At the same time, **we do not apologize for mistakes** (e.g., "CBC.ca regrets the error"), **unless instructed to do so by our Legal Department.**

**Unless otherwise stated, errors are assumed to be CBC's.** (If incorrect information has come from radio or television reports, we do not blame them because we're all part of the same corporation.) **If incorrect information has come from outside the CBC** (e.g., The Canadian Press, The Associated Press, Reuters, etc.), **we can specify the source of the mistake as long as we're certain blame rests there.** Otherwise, we simply acknowledge that the error appeared on our website and, by doing so, take full responsibility for it.

**Except in rare cases** when the CBC's Law Department has told us to use certain language, **the journalist in charge of the web space** (or a delegate during a given shift) **approves the final wording of all correction notices**. Even when dealing with a directive from our lawyers, CBC writers and editors can always propose improvements — suggesting any awkward or editorially unsatisfactory language be changed. In such cases, it's up to the Law Department to determine whether the recommendations are acceptable.

**We never publish more than one corrections box at the bottom of an article.** If several revisions are made to a single story, these changes can be summed up in separate entries within the same section of the central corrections and clarifications page, as well as within the same box at the bottom of the story.

**ALL correction notices must be copy edited before being published** to make sure there are no typos or other mistakes.


**Clarifications**
**Making stories easier to understand** by using more precise language, recasting sentences, filling holes, eliminating ambiguity, providing readers with key context, etc., **is part of the normal writing and editing process. Articles can often be improved this way even after the first versions are published with no special flag for readers beyond the date/time stamp being updated.** These revisions represent the equivalent of poor photos being replaced with higher quality or better composed images later in the news cycle.

**Examples**: A story about a death in an ambulance fails to point out that the paramedics had been told to take the patient to a specific hospital, even though the trip would probably take at least five minutes longer. A story implies that a union leader was present when violence erupted on the picket line, when in reality he had left the site hours earlier after delivering a speech imploring strikers to protest peacefully.
**
From time to time, however, we need to acknowledge clarifications — especially if the changes can no longer be made as part of the normal news cycle** (i.e., the stories are more than 24 hours old). **The key criterion is whether the original wording has probably led to a significant misunderstanding of one or more central elements of the story. These changes are called "clarifications" rather than "corrections" because our first story was not actually wrong.** Instead, the journalism was incomplete, fuzzy or in some other way open to easy misinterpretation.

**Example 1**: A story published more than 24 hours ago may give the impression that a historic UN Security Council vote was unanimous when in reality one of the countries with a veto abstained. We can no longer clarify the text as part of the normal news cycle. The story is not wrong as such, merely incomplete and potentially misleading. We've received email complaints about the original version and decide that reference to the abstention should be added. The article's original date/time stamp is left untouched, but we flag the edit with a clarification notice at the bottom of the article.
**
Example 2**: A headline on our site implies that a country's prime minister has apologized for a deadly airstrike when he's only expressed "regret" over the loss of life. We feel the difference in wording is subtle but important. The text is revised as part of the normal news cycle, but we also highlight the change to acknowledge that the original language may have misled some readers. We flag the edit with a clarification notice at the bottom of the article.

CBC.ca does not routinely revise articles this way. Clarifications are not automatically published merely because someone writes in with a complaint, for instance. They constitute a special type of Level 2 flaw because it's usually not immediately obvious if the original wording has led to misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the story by the average reader.

**The same guidelines used for corrections apply to clarifications, with the relevant journalist in charge of the web space** (or delegate during a given shift) **ruling on whether the edit should be publicly acknowledged, and, if so, on the final wording.**

**The only difference is that we use the label "clarification" rather than "correction" in the revision notice.** This box is also published at the bottom of the story. It should include the date and time of the change.

In the case of stories more than 24 hours old, any significant changes (beyond fixed typos and other minor slips) must be acknowledged in the highlight box at the bottom of the article, as outlined in the section on [archived stories](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#changing) below.


**Life of corrections and clarifications**
**The corrections and clarification notices published at the bottom of web stories are permanent.** These boxes — generated by our in-house publishing tool — let our audience easily review any significant changes that were made to the text they're reading.


**Changing archived stories**
**Even though technology allows us to revise old articles without electronic fingerprints on the story, we must be extremely judicious** when exercising this power. (In this case, "old" is defined as being published more than 24 hours ago.)

**Only Level 1 flaws** (typos and other equally minor slips) **in archived stories can be corrected this way** (i.e., invisibly revised), **and the journalist in charge of the web space** (executive producer or higher) **must always be alerted.** NOTE: She or he does not need to be notified about Level 1 flaws in "current" content, published in the last 24 hours. Archived journalism, however, is treated differently.

**If any other mistakes are detected in old stories, the errors should be fixed and the revisions acknowledged in a box at the bottom of the story in the usual manner** (as outlined in "[How we correct](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#how)" above). The date/time stamp at the top of the article must not be changed. Instead, the date and time of the revision must be included in the corrections box itself.

In addition to supporting honesty and transparency in our journalism, **fixing old flaws this way reduces the risk that the same error will be repeated when fresh stories are written** as we — and some of our readers — review previous coverage of a given event.

**But we must avoid dishonestly rewriting history and making it appear that our original coverage included more or different information** (e.g., additional facts about a hijacking or the cause of a plane crash). As pointed out in the corporation's [Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on correcting archived online material](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fcorrections-corrections-et-clarifications-1.4523122&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1hBNc8o5buNxIeXY0ZLLPh):


> A dated story is not necessarily wrong. It is a reflection of the facts known at the time of publication. It can be an important part of the historical record.


Since responsibly worded journalism properly attributes anything that's not confirmed as fact, most archived stories should stand as is. But corrections and [clarifications](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#clarifications) are periodically warranted.

**Fixing alerts**
Alerts are brief capsules sent directly to other platforms (e.g., email addresses and various wireless devices). Since they're not posted on our website, we cannot go into a file and change them later. For this reason, we must be particularly careful before hitting "send."

If an error is made, our only recourse is to issue a new alert that corrects the old wording — an undesirable option that should be resorted to only when absolutely necessary.

**We publish new alerts to correct flawed ones when a recent alert contains a Level 3 factual error or a Level 2 mistake that could mislead readers** (i.e., change the meaning of what was originally sent).

In this case, "recent" is generally considered within the previous two hours.

**Revised alerts should always begin with the new, correct information. The closing line should acknowledge our error in a brief, straightforward fashion.** For instance:

> A B.C. judge has found both suspects not guilty of all charges in the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182. The blast, which killed 329 people, was the largest case of mass murder in Canadian history. A previous alert sent a short time ago included incorrect information about the year of the explosion and the number of deaths.


Be extra careful when sending a second alert as a correction. In the past, we've sometimes rushed to fix one mistake only to discover an embarrassing slip in the correction itself.

**We do NOT publish new alerts to correct previous ones when the flaw is merely a typo or other minor mistake, such as a stylistic blunder.**

Whenever in doubt about sending a correction in the form of a new alert, writers should try to consult their supervisor first. If this is not possible, they should contact another writer or editor on duty to help decide on the best course of action.


**Corresponding with the public**
Mistakes are often brought to our attention by readers who send emails through our website's Report a Typo feature.

Some complaints are unfounded. Many are legitimate. A few require investigation to see if we made an error.

All mistakes are fixed as quickly as possible. But it's up to the journalist in charge of the web space where the content was originally posted (senior producer or higher) to determine if we need to flag the revision for our readers (as outlined in [authorizing correction notices](/home/c/corrections-and-clarifications#authorizing) above). Online journalists should give this person as much information about Level 2 and Level 3 flaws as quickly as possible so she/he can make an informed decision in a timely fashion.

When readers fill out our online Report a Typo forms, they're generally thanked for their submission **Periodically, we may decide to respond to an email complaint or query.** But we must always keep in mind that writing clear, sound and neutral emails is challenging, especially since the intended tone of letters can be easily misinterpreted. Extra care should be exercised when a legal issue has been raised or an ad hominem attack launched.

**Learning lessons from our mistakes**
The internet includes all sorts of incredible stuff. It's also chock full of not-so-credible content — otherwise known as rumours, assumptions and generally unreliable claims.

**There are countless reasons for Level 2 and Level 3 flaws**, including not checking with a source, misunderstanding the source and relying on an erroneous source. **Level 1 flaws, on the other hand, tend to be caused by bad spelling, sloppy typing, poor proofreading and unfamiliarity with in-house style.**

**To reduce the number of errors on our site:**

-   **CBCNews.ca writers** should consult our style manual (the Language Guide), use an electronic spellchecker, carefully proofread their own copy before submitting it, answer editors' questions about their stories, be willing to check anything in doubt, and take note of any mistakes pointed out in constructive critiques of their work.
-   **CBCNews.ca editors** should consult our style manual (the Language Guide), use an electronic spellchecker, rewrite with care, ask writers to clarify anything ambiguous or to confirm anything suspicious, flag trends in slips (including typos), and take note of any mistakes pointed out in constructive critiques of their own editing.

**Effective writing and editing is collaborative.** It's a way to (i) produce the best possible journalism for our readers, and (ii) get better at one's craft by learning from colleagues. CBC News staff are encouraged to approach the process in this spirit.

**By taking as much care as possible to make sure our stories are accurate, and by quickly and transparently correcting errors** (or clarifying anything that's potentially misleading), **we maintain the CBC News brand's credibility and help distinguish our journalism on the World Wide Web.**

### Courts

**Court versus court**

## **Capitalize superior courts, courts of appeal, etc., but not generic lower court names:**

> **Admiralty Court**
>
> **Appeal Court, Court of Appeal** (See also U.S. [Court of Appeals](/) below)
>
> **Court of King’s Bench** (or **Court of Queen's Bench** in historical references)
>
> **European Court of Justice**
>
> family **court**
>
> **Federal Court, Federal Appeal Court**
>
> **International Court of Justice**
>
> **Ontario provincial court** (lowercase when generic descriptive label is used)
>
> **Ontario Court of Justice** (initial caps when unique, formal name of provincial court is used)
>
> **Alberta's provincial court system** was established in 1906 (lowercase when generic descriptive label is used)
>
> **Alberta Court of Justice** (initial caps when unique, formal name of provincial court is used)
>
> the **provincial court**
>
> small claims **court**
>
> **Superior Court** (in Quebec)
>
> **Superior Court of Justice** (in Ontario), commonly called the **Ontario Superior Court**
>
> **Yukon Supreme Court**
>
> **Supreme Court** (federal, provincial, or state), as in **Supreme Court of Canada** ([SCC](/home/s#SupremeCourt))
>
> **Tax Court** (Canada and the U.S.)
>
> territorial **court** (N.W.T.), Yukon's **territorial court**, etc.
>
> youth **court**


Be aware that superior courts in Canada go by different names, depending on the province or territory (e.g., the **Saskatchewan Court of King's Bench**, the **B.C. Supreme Court** and the **Quebec Superior Court**).

## **Use lowercase in general references:**

> **courthouse
> courtroom
> the court** ordered, **the court** was told ...
> the **provincial court judge** 

## **Avoid confusing the names of courts of appeal:**

In Canada, it's easiest and accurate to refer to the highest court within a given province or territory as an appeal court (e.g., the **Alberta Court of Appeal**), even if some have slightly longer forms (e.g., the "Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador" can simply be called the **Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal**). Be cautious with historical references, since some proper nouns are no longer used (e.g., the Ontario Court of Appeal was previously called the Supreme Court of Ontario). Two other common nouns are the **Federal Court of Appeal** and the **Supreme Court of Canada** (abbreviated as [SCC](/home/s#SupremeCourt), not SCOC).


**Court of Appeals** **(U.S.)**


**For proper nouns** (with initial caps), **match official names:**

> **the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit**
>
> **U.S. Court of Appeals** (Acceptable when reporting on a specific circuit's court in the U.S. There are 11 of them.)


**For generic references, lowercase "appeal" and "appeals" are both acceptable** — although it's best to be consistent within a story.

> a U.S. federal **court of appeals** will be asked to rule
>
> a U.S. **appeals court**
>
> three U.S. federal **appeals courts**
>
> an **appeal court** or an **appeals court**

**When the key element of a compound noun falls at the beginning of the unit** (e.g., _court in court martial_), **this word takes the “s” in the plural form:**

 chief of staff

 chiefs of staff

 court martial

 courts martial

 daughter-in-law

 daughters-in-law

 editor-in-chief

 editors-in-chief

 going-on 

 goings-on

 notary public

 notaries public

 passer-by

 passers-by

 poet laureate

 poets laureate



**The word “general” requires special care. It may or may not take the “s” depending on whether it’s the key element of the compound.**


In the case of the Governor General, the word Governor is the primary term.

 attorney general 

 attorneys general

 auditor general

 auditors general

 consul general

 consuls general

 Governor General     _(capitalize for current)_

 governors general   _(lowercase for past office holders)_



But in military contexts, “general” is the actual rank:

lieutenant-general 

 lieutenant-generals

 major-general

 major-generals


For a more detailed look at “general,” including when to use a hyphen, see [–general](/home/g/generalsuffix) and [Governor General](/home/g/governor-general).

For more information on when to put these compounds in capital letters (Attorney General, for instance, or Maj.-Gen), see [titles](/home/t/titles) and [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks).

### cpap

**The Canadian Press, The Associated Press**

Unless the word "the" appears at the start of a sentence, a capital "T" (The) is normally reserved for the titles of compositions (many books, broadcast shows, films, poems, songs, etc., such as _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The National_), popular rather than reference magazines (e.g., The New Yorker but the New England Journal of Medicine), and for specialty TV channels that feature "The" in the official name (e.g., The Sports Network, also known as TSN).

Based on established convention, however, we also use a capital "T" when directly referring to North America's two largest news agencies:


> **The** Canadian Press
> **The** Associated Press


(CBCNews.ca adopted this additional exception in the spring of 2009 to reflect common wire story style.)


**Nouns**
In this context, referring "directly" to CP or AP means that the proper names are spelled out and function as nouns rather than as adjectives in the main bodies of stories.


> The plane crashed 30 minutes later, according to **The** Canadian Press.
>
> Budget cuts will be announced Thursday, she told **The** Associated Press.

**Adjectives**
When CP and AP are adjectives, "the" is tied to a different noun (e.g., story, reporter, manual) and should remain lowercase:


> Details were in **the** Canadian Press **story** that ran on the paper's front page.
>
> She based her decision on guidelines in **the** Associated Press **manual**.

**Adjectives versus possessives**
Be sure to distinguish between adjectives (which take "the") and possessive's (which take "The"). Prefer the former construction whenever possible:


> Investigators detained **the** Associated Press reporter for more than an hour.
>
> He worked at **The** Associated Press's Washington bureau for 25 years.

**Newspapers**
Use a small "t" for all other news organizations, including newspapers:


> They sued **the** Globe and Mail and **The** Canadian Press for defamation.
>
> He resigned from **the** New York Times two years later.
>
> She moved to **the** News Corporation, which owns Dow Jones, in 2008.


**CP, AP (Headlines, second reference, photo credits, etc.)**
A definite article ("the") is not required when the initials CP or AP are used in headlines, second reference, etc.


> They talked to **CP** about the lawsuit (_not_ "talked to the CP").
>
> He's expected to resign Thursday, sources told **AP** (_not_ "told the AP").
>
> **CP** Online Video, **AP** Financial News


But our style is to add a definite article in spelled-out photo credits at the end of captions.


> Tannis Toohey**/The Canadian Press**
>
> Hal Buell**/The Associated Press**


See CBCNews'ca's comprehensive [Photo Style Guide & Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o9AGtErLae5I43rHVjO4s446Nn-yeTvc3Dai5lzSNOw/edit) for details.    

Also, always use a capital "T" in spelled-out attribution conventionally linked to a definite article, including credits in italics at the bottom of CBCNews.ca stories:


> _With files from **The** Canadian Press_
>
> _With files from **The** Canadian Press and **The** Associated Press_


See CBCNews.ca's overview on [wire copy](/home/w/wire-copy) for more details about credits.


**CP, AP manuals**
While a capital "T" (The) is normally retained in book titles, a lowercase "t" is used when referring to certain works, including many religious texts (the Bible, the Qur'an, the Talmud) and reference books (the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, the Canadian Press Stylebook, the Encyclopaedia Britannica).

See [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the) for general guidelines on the titles of books, broadcast programs, films, paintings, etc. A small "t" is used in definite articles introducing virtually all businesses, public or private organizations, sports teams, music groups, awards, nicknames, etc. (e.g., the Bay, the Blue Jays, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Future Shop, the Guess Who, the Oscars, the Red Planet, the United Nations).

See also [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics), which includes a section on why [newspaper names](/home/n#newspaper) are kept in regular type.

### Crimea

**Crimea**

Claim to the region is disputed. **Russia annexed Crimea in early 2014. But Ukraine considers the annexation illegal.** Furthermore, Kyiv disputes the results of a controversial 2014 Moscow-led referendum that suggested a majority of citizens in Crimea want to be part of Russia. **Many countries, including Canada, refuse to accept Russia's claim to Crimea.**

**Be precise and judicious with language in coverage of Crimea.** Some wording has prompted complaints to the CBC Ombudsman over the years.

**It's accurate and OK to use the term occupation** (e.g., **Russian-occupied Crimea**). Russia's presence in Crimea is considered an occupation by much of the world community, including a majority of the United Nations as well as the International Criminal Court.

**But avoid terms such as "invaded" and "attacked,"** which imply military battles during the initial takeover. There's no evidence of fighting or of substantial armed resistance by the local population. Instead, some Ukrainian military commanders either stayed on the sidelines or defected. This prompted neutral observers to describe Russian troop movements as akin to military forces walking through an open door.

Organizers of a **March 2014 referendum** said a majority of people in Crimea asked to leave Ukraine and join Russia, but **most of the international community dismissed the vote as illegitimate**. Criticism ranged from the way the ballot questions were worded to how the referendum was conducted, since Ukraine's constitution requires that any changes to the country's territory be approved by a referendum involving all of its citizens.

**Use Crimea alone as a geographical locator in TV supers, maps, etc.** (e.g., Kerch, Crimea). **Avoid either "Crimea, Ukraine" or "Crimea, Russia."** There are two reasons:


> **1\. It's impossible to convey the complexities of the territorial dispute adequately in a geographical locator.** Picking either Ukraine or Russia amounts to siding with either Kyiv or Moscow. And picking, say, Ukraine, to match the UN's stance, or the government of Canada's position, fails to reflect the realities on the ground (i.e., Russian control over Crimea).
>
> **2\. The peninsula is familiar enough to our audience to stand on its own as a geographical name.** This was true even before the 2014 annexation. Referring to "Crimea" alone is similar to writing "Sicily" alone (rather than "Sicily, Italy"). This is standard publishing style at many news services, including CP and AP.


**Prefer the entrenched spelling Crimea.** Avoid the transliteration "Krimea." See also [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names) and [Russian names](/home/r/russian-names)


**NOTE:** The above focuses on the 2014 annexation of Crimea. **For guidelines about the 2022 Russia invasion of Ukraine**, see [Donbas (Donetsk, Luhansk)](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/donbas_donetsk_luhansk/ "Donbas_Donetsk_Luhansk") as well as a related 2022 update about [Russia's referendums, annexations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2022/2022-09-30/ "2022 09 30").

### crisis

**Crisis**

There's **no single, narrow definition of crisis.** It can mean **everything from "a critical moment" to "a time of great difficulty,"** according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. **Despite this subjectivity, crisis normally implies a significant hardship or challenge requiring urgent, sometimes emergency, measures.**

For instance, an expected or unremarkable downturn in employment is NOT a crisis, even though some people may lose jobs, homes, etc. The same is true of a cyclical dip in the price of oil or other resource commodities. But a major, unusual shift in economic conditions that potentially hurts a lot of people directly or indirectly is commonly called a crisis (e.g., **the 2008 financial crisis**, which many reputable economists said pushed the world to the brink of a depression). **A crisis is not limited to a certain size or shape.** It can be global, national, regional or local. It can be primarily limited to one industry, or it can cascade across various economic sectors.

**Three caveats:**


> **1\. Avoid overusing the term crisis.** Like the word "disaster," it **should generally be reserved for something extraordinary** (e.g., a routine wind storm causes damage, but a hurricane causes massive destruction requiring disaster relief). So a rare political dispute that divides the country or paralyzes Parliament might well be called a **constitutional crisis**, but the routine fall of a minority government would normally not qualify. And the outbreak of an unusual, deadly illness might typically be called a **health crisis** (e.g., SARS in 2003), but a slightly nastier, annual flu season would not merit the label. **In many cases, a public policy debate is implied** (e.g., a **housing crisis** might require looking at the merits of rent control, a **debt crisis** might involve weighing the costs and benefits of government borrowing as a specific percentage of GDP, and an **oil price crisis** might involve oil production cuts/increases in times of gluts/shortages). In May 2019, Canada's environment minister tabled a motion in the House of Commons that referred to the climate change as both a "crisis" and an "emergency," underscoring that **climate crisis** and **climate emergency** are increasingly common expressions in debates over what to do about **global warming**, which the United Nations calls "[the defining issue of our time](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fen%2Fsections%2Fissues-depth%2Fclimate-change%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0r01B2nP4zMzdiJsD8mUO_)." (See **[climate change](/home/c/climate-change)** for caveats about when the word crisis may not be the best choice.)
>
> **2\. Be aware that "crisis" is used in some other contexts in perfectly acceptable ways,** including as a modifier (e.g., a **crisis centre**, a **crisis management** team). This underscores that the word has various shades of meaning to Canadians.
>
> **3\. Be cautious when putting quotation marks around "crisis,"** which **can wrongly convey skepticism** (i.e., the "oil crisis" can be misread as the **[so-called](/home/s/so-called) crisis**). Although attribution is sometimes a sound way to try to stay neutral, it can also backfire with certain language. Since the word "crisis" cannot be objectively defined, and since it's already used in relatively loose ways in everyday speech (a crisis of confidence), **it's generally best to either use the word or not** (based on criteria listed above), **rather than to put "crisis" in quotation marks throughout our coverage** of a given story.


The plural of crisis is **crises**.

### Crown

**Crown versus crown**

**Always keep "Crown" uppercase when the word refers to Canada’s head of state** (the Queen) **or to the state itself** (land owned by the state, lawyers representing the state, etc.)

the Crown (_usually prosecution but can also mean judge_)
Crown attorney
Crown attorney Jackie White
Crown prosecutor Jackie White
Crown land
a Crown corporation
the Crown Jewels housed in the Tower of London, but the Queen’s crown
the crown jewel of their collection (_all lowercase because it's a generic label_)
a crown prince, but uppercase in a specific title: Crown Prince Haakon

## **Ceremonies like coronations**

**At coronations, weddings, funerals and other special ceremonies, it's customary to capitalize a lot of royal regalia** and related paraphernalia **when a key object's full name is used**:

St. Edward's Crown (_specific name_)
the coronation crown (_generic description_)
Imperial State Crown
Queen Mary’s Crown
the Sovereign's Ring (_versus generic terms like the "coronation ring" or the "coronation rings"_)
the Queen Consort’s Ring
the Wedding Ring of England
the Sovereign's Orb
the Sovereign's Sceptre With Cross (_versus generic reference to one of the sovereign's sceptres_)
the Sovereign's Sceptre With Dove
the Queen Consort’s Rod with Dove
the Sword of State
the Sword of Offering

**This applies to some components of objects that are, themselves, distinct**, such as a well-known precious stone  (e.g., the Black Prince's Ruby in the Imperial State Crown). **In second reference, such nouns are generally shortened to generic lowercase renderings**, as in the ruby, the ring(s), the sceptre(s), the sword(s), etc.

**Not all Crown-related ceremonial objects are capitalized, however, even in first reference.** In coverage of a coronation, for instance, references to a flask like the golden ampulla, to golden bracelets known as armills, and to the silver spoon used to anoint the sovereign, are traditionally kept lowercase in news reporting.

See also [royal titles](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-titles/ "Royal titles") for various related guidelines (e.g., royal is almost always lowercase, except in Royal Family)

### CT and CAT scans

**CT and CAT scans**

**Use the term CT scan** unless you’re absolutely certain you're writing about the original, less-sophisticated technology (CAT scan). CT scan has largely replaced the older label.

**Background**
X-rays are two-dimensional. But if a series of X-rays are taken at slightly different angles and then combined using a computer, you end up with a cross-sectional image of a patient.

In the 1970s, this diagnostic technology became known as a _CAT scan_.

Since then, a more sophisticated approach has been developed that goes beyond one plane (i.e., that is not limited to “axial” tomography). This technology is referred to as a _CT scan_.

**Abbreviation alone**
**There is no need to spell out CT or CAT** (just as it’s unnecessary to define DNA as _deoxyribonucleic acid_ or MRI as _magnetic resonance imaging_).

But if you do want to use words instead of initials in second reference, refer to CT as “computed tomography” and CAT as “computerized axial tomography.”

Note: Medical experts rarely bother to spell out the initials, and when they do a variety of different forms are used (e.g., CAT is sometimes defined as _computerized axial tomography, computed axial tomography_ or _computer-assisted tomography_, while CT is sometimes defined as _computerized tomography_ or _computed tomography_).

**Abbreviation plus description**
**Briefly describing the technology rather than spelling out the initials is the best option** in a news story. In this case, define a CT scan as a high-tech or sophisticated way to merge a series of X-rays into a detailed picture taken from different angles.

### cult versus sect

**Cult versus sect**

It's unhelpful to our audience to toss around names (e.g., the Community of the Lady of All Nations) without putting these nouns into context. At the same time, **we must avoid portraying religious groups and movements unfairly** with convenient but misleading labels.

**Here are some points to consider** before using words such as sect or cult:


**Religions**
Systems of faith and worship that include the belief that God shared direct revelations in the past, and that writings about the faith are now closed to revision. **Established religions include Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Mormonism and Sikhism.**

**
Denominations**
**Groups within an established religion**, such as Roman Catholic, Anglican and Baptist in Christianity. Well-known denominations do not need to be defined as such in stories. The term "ecumenical" refers to all denominations within Christianity. **Sometimes, terms such as "division" are used instead of denomination. Islam, for example, has Sunni and Shia followers.**

**
Movements**
**Groups sharing common objectives**, such as members of a peace movement. It can sometimes have a religious foundation. Quakers, for example, are members of a group known as the Society of Friends— often described as a "Christian movement."


**Sects**
**Breakaway groups.** While they seek a purer form of worship considered lost or abandoned by traditional religions or denominations, **they usually still maintain the basic tenets of a particular faith.**The Community of the Lady of All Nations is an example of a Roman Catholic sect.


**Cults**
**Groups generally considered outside mainstream religion and culture.** They promote unorthodox systems of belief. **The word cult has a sinister connotation** that often suggests brainwashing, secretive communities and rituals, exploitation of members by one or more charismatic leaders, etc. **Some cults have nothing to do with religion.** Convicted murdered Charles Mason is an example of a cult leader.


**Attribute contested labels**
**Unless a particular group is widely known as a "cult," the term should generally be attributed.** To describe Wicca as a "witchcraft cult," for example, offends members who see it as a branch of paganism or shamanism.


**Give audiences background
Including a brief sentence of relevant background can give people enough information to draw their own conclusions about new or obscure groups.** In a story about the Church of the Firstborn and General Assembly of Heaven, for example, we could write: "The self-described religious sect was started by an excommunicated **[Mormon](/home/m/mormon-mormonism)** who claimed to be the Holy Ghost."

### CUSMA

**Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**

**The new free trade agreement negotiated between Canada, the United States and Mexico in 2018 is referred to by different names**. Preferred options include:


> the **Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade** (the word "trade" is not actually in the title)
> **CUSMA** (spelled out once in a story as the **Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement**)
> the **new North American Free Trade Agreement**
> the **new NAFTA**
> **NAFTA 2.0**


Since the capital A stands for Agreement, **avoid redundancies like "NAFTA agreement" and "CUSMA agreement,"** which are akin to writing, say, "RCMP police" and "NDP party."

NOTE: NAFTA remains in effect until the new agreement is officially ratified by each country's national legislative body. The signing ceremony by government leaders on Nov. 30, 2018, was essentially just the first symbolic step toward formal ratification. That text was amended a year later (in December 2019) before Democrats agreed to table the legislation in Congress.

**While the U.S. prefers to call the revised deal the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), this is not actually the official name.** The deal's preamble simply refers to "an Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada," which boils down to something closer to "AUSAUMSC" than to "USMCA." In Spanish, it's referred to as _Tratado entre México, Estados Unidos y Canadá_ (T-MEC).

**A few reasons CBC News prefers CUSMA** over USMCA:


> **1\. CUSMA is clearest to our audience because it's used by the government of Canada**, one of two English parties to the agreement. CUSMA is the noun that appears in federal government documents, and on the [Global Affairs Canada website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.international.gc.ca%2Ftrade-commerce%2Ftrade-agreements-accords-commerciaux%2Fagr-acc%2Fcusma-aceum%2Findex.aspx%3Flang%3Deng&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3IwAIt4OoMZig6kLDBUSww).
>
> **2\. CUSMA is pronounceable** (i.e., an acronym rather than just an abbreviation), which makes it easier to incorporate into broadcast scripts. By contrast, the only conversational way to turn "USMCA" into an acronym is to introduce one or more additional letters (e.g., "US-Ma-CA"), which is at best an unorthodox approach to abbreviations. CUSMA, of course, does not need to be turned into an acronym, like NAFTA or NATO. Instead, it can simply be spelled out at C-U-S-M-A in radio and TV scripts, if preferred. As of December 2019, there was still no entrenched pronunciation of "CUSMA," with agreed-on vowel sounds, etc.


It's worth noting that **our colleagues at Radio-Canada also put Canada first in the French version of the name**: _Accord Canada–États-Unis–Mexique_ (ACEUM)

When relevant and practical, **consider pointing out that the agreement is also known as USMCA (once, parenthetically, if there's room).** This is particularly important in stories featuring clips or transcribed web quotes that mention USMCA.

Be aware that it's not uncommon for different countries to prefer different names for international agreements. For instance, in the 1980s, the original Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) was commonly called the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement south of the border.

**Dawson City** (Although technically a town, it can be referred to as Dawson City based on legislation as well as long-standing convention.) During the Klondike Gold Rush more than a century ago, this [Yukon](/home/y/yukon) community boasted the largest population of any centre north of San Francisco and west of Winnipeg — 40,000 in 1898, compared to Vancouver's 25,000. Today, it's a small fraction of that size. While the Geographical Names Board of Canada officially calls it "Dawson," the territory's own Municipal Act clearly states that the town "shall have the name the City of Dawson." But avoid the generic, lowercase term "city" in second reference. Instead, call it Dawson or the town, the community, etc.

**Day versus day**
Keep "day" lowercase ([**election day**](/home/e#electionday)) unless it's part of the proper name of a religious holiday, feast or other [special time](/home/h/holidays) with a unique spot on the calendar (**All Saints' Day, Christmas Day, Christmas Eve, Earth Day, Mother's Day, New Year's Day, Remembrance Day, Valentine's Day**, etc.)

**daycare, daycare centre** (By comparison, the noun [child care](/home/c#childcare) is spelled as two separate words in North America, and the adjective child-care has a hyphen).

**day home** (n. and adj.), **day home agencies, family day home subsidies**, etc. In some jurisdictions, such as Alberta, day homes offer government-approved child care in a family home setting. The term does not need to be defined in stories as long as the context is clear. As a compound term, day home is not fused (following the same construction as nursing home and daycare centre).

**daylight time** (_preferred over_ daylight saving time). But avoid ADT, EDT, etc., in virtually all clock references. **Use AT, ET**, etc., instead. The only exception is Saskatchewan, which remains on CST all year. (See [time](/home/t/time) for detailed explanation and guidelines)

**de**

**de, der, di, du, d'** (When retained as part of a family name, capitalize lowercase elements only when they begin a sentence: **Charles de Gaulle**... **De Gaulle** said ....) Several factors affect whether de, du, etc., are kept in second reference. See [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for details.

**de Chastelain, John** (de Chastelain in second reference) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks) for guidelines on handling former titles (retired general John de Chastelain), as well as [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for an overview of retaining or dropping de, du, van, von, etc., in surnames standing alone.

**deadbeat parent(s); deadbeat dads and moms** (Common and acceptable terms to describe men and women who fail to make court-ordered child support payments) Do not use the narrower label "deadbeat dads" unless specifically referring to men. When statistics are known and there's room in the story, consider including the percentage of deadbeat parents who are men to provide context. Depending on the year and province, this figure has been estimated at more than 90 per cent, according to government sources.

**deepfake** (n., adj., and v.) Refers to sophisticated, computer-based alteration of images and video that are difficult to detect. The plural is **deepfakes**. Generally define in first reference unless the meaning is already clear from context (e.g., "a **deepfake video** is one that's doctored with artificial intelligence"). It's increasingly common and OK to use deepfake as a verb.

**deepsea** (adj., no hyphen), **deepsea diving** (See also [deepwater](/home/d#deepwater))

**Deep South** (U.S.)

**deepwater** (n. and adj.), **deepwater exploration** (While the noun deepwater technically refers to depths of at least four kilometers, where ocean abysses begin, it is conventionally applied to **deepsea** levels, which generally start at 1,000 metres. The attributive noun is also fused, as in a **deepwater oil rig**. When referring to shallower bodies — pools, lakes, rivers — the noun water stands alone when modified by deep, as in "She swam in **deep water**.")

**Dia de Muertos** (**Day of the Dead**) Include the English translation in stories in first reference. The festival to remember departed souls is celebrated in Mexico, the U.S. and some other countries in early November. It's OK but unnecessary to use the longer Spanish version, **Dia de los Muertos**. Either is grammatically acceptable, according to the Royal Spanish Academy. Since the name Dia de Muertos is more common in North America, however, it's generally the best choice. (See also [holidays](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/holidays/ "Holidays") for related capitalization guidelines)

**diagnose, diagnosis** (Diseases and other problems are diagnosed, not people or things. See [diagnosis versus prognosis](/home/d/diagnosis-versus-prognosis).)

****dialysis*

*diameter****

**Diana;** or **the late Princess of Wales** (See [royal titles](/home/r/royal-titles) for background on the informal use of "Princess Diana")

**diaper (noun)** Normally implies a disposable rather than a washable undergarment unless specified. The term is **generally OK when referring to both infants and adults.** But avoid the expression "seniors' diapers," which suggests that only elderly people wear them. Be aware that some adults object to calling disposable briefs "diapers." Respect declared preferences when reporting on specific people. One option is to leave out the noun when it's already implied (e.g., "Investigators said her mother had been left in soiled clothing for days"). However, avoid adopting dense, bureaucratic euphemisms (e.g., "disposable incontinence underwear") outside of directly transcribed quotes. Not all Canadians are familiar with the British synonym "nappy," which means a brief definition may be required if the meaning is not obvious from context. **Steer clear of the verb "diaper" when referring to adults.** The noun is considered a neutral, fact-based detail in stories about an aging population, about various health conditions (e.g., skin infections caused by adult "diaper rash"), about the treatment of residents in long-term care facilities, about environmental issues (e.g., the rise in baby and adult diapers tossed into landfills), etc. By contrast, the verb's use is conventionally reserved for infants (i.e., "to diaper a newborn").

****diaphragm****

**diarrhea**

**diaspora** (lowercase) The term's meaning has gradually expanded in recent years. It comes from an ancient Greek word for "scattering," and initially referred to the dispersion of Jewish people from what is now Israeli and Palestinian territory more than 2,500 years ago (the **Jewish diaspora**). A sense of "forced migration" continues to be associated with the term in certain contexts. The word sometimes also applies to itinerant communities without their own country (e.g., **Romani diaspora**). During the second half of the 20th century, however, **diaspora has acquired a much more general connotation**. In 2018, for instance, the [UN's Organization for Migration (IOM) defined diaspora](https://belgium.iom.int/diaspora-engagement) as "migrants or descendants of migrants whose identity and sense of belonging have been shaped by their migration experience and background." In other words, the term can convey the broad sense of "a transnational community" that extends beyond the borders of any one country, according to [the Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/immigrant-diasporas-in-canada) (e.g., the world's **Ukrainian diaspora**, a given country's **Chinese diaspora**).

**Diavik** (OK in headlines) **Diavik diamond mine** refers to the operation in the Northwest Territories; **Diavik Diamond Mines Inc.** refers to company, and should be spelled out once in full in business stories.

Dickensian****

**Dictaphone** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a dictation recorder)

**dictator** (OK as fact-based detail) Generally prefer using a given leader's political title (e.g., president) in first reference, and then the family name in second reference. It's acceptable to add context about totalitarian [regimes](/home/r#regime), however, as long as the detail is demonstrably accurate, and the wording is not intentionally vilifying. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary broadly defines "dictator" as "a ruler with unrestricted authority." Determining what's "unrestricted," of course, is sometimes debatable. Common characteristics of dictatorships are single party states, no elections, no free press, use of the police or military to quell political opposition and to restrict the rights of citizens, etc. In the case of certain historical figures, entrenched use of "dictator" is rarely controversial (e.g., Idi Amin, Jean-Claude Duvalier, Moammar Gadhafi, Saddam Hussein). But **for sitting leaders or those recently in power, avoid labels like "dictator" unless evidence of totalitarianism is clear** (e.g., Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un). **If "dictator" is accurate, always keep the wording fair, and avoid even the perception of demonization** by generally limiting use of the term to one or two references in a single story. For details, see two related CBC ombudsman rulings: [If the word fits, use it](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcbc.radio-canada.ca%2Fen%2Fombudsman%2Freviews%2F2016-01-28-b&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3stJ0L-J36B48JfdGwvr1X) (Jan. 28, 2016), and [When using 'dictator' is not bias](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcbc.radio-canada.ca%2Fen%2Fombudsman%2Freviews%2F2017-03-15&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gdjCOnyEr8G7VGSDAm3kQ) (March 15, 2017).

**directeur général** (A common title in Quebec, often translated as **CEO** in English) While CEO suits companies (e.g., _président-directeur général_ becomes "president and CEO"), avoid applying it to contexts that don't make sense in English (e.g., a union's _directeur général_ should be called an "executive director" rather than a "CEO").

****dishonour****

**dishonourable discharge** (an American term that doesn't apply to Canadian troops) When military personnel are kicked out of the Canadian Armed Forces, they're normally **dismissed** or **dismissed with disgrace**, depending on the ruling of a court martial. See also [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview#miscellaneous)

**disinformation** (n., adj.) **A specific type of [misinformation](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/misinformation/ "Misinformation")**. Disinformation refers to **the intentional dissemination of false or distorted information** in order to confuse or mislead. The term once strongly implied government falsehoods to other states, the media and its own people. But disinformation has since been used more generically, without an automatic connection to government authorities. The word is believed to have been coined in the mid-1950s. Its exact origins are unknown, although some lexicographers think it may be an English version of the Russian term "_dezinformacija_," which first appeared in 1949.

Options include the **Department of National Defence** (as long as the story's context makes "Canada" clear), Canada's **Department of Defence**, and Canada's **Defence Department**. See [Department versus department](/home/d/department) and [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for related guidelines

**dollar** (see [money](/home/m/money) for detailed guidelines on use of $ symbol, on preferred references to Canadian currency versus foreign currency, etc.)

**Dominica** (small Caribbean island republic)

**Dominican Republic** (avoid the abbreviation D.R., which is too unfamiliar for general use) Never imply that this Caribbean country is an island unto itself. The Dominican Republic is on the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola. A separate country, Haiti, occupies the western side. In headlines and second reference, **the Dominican** is acceptable.

**dominion**, but **Dominion of Canada**

**domino, dominoes**

[**Donbas**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/donbas_donetsk_luhansk/ "Donbas_Donetsk_Luhansk") (common name of **Donets Basin** in southeastern Europe) For consistency, use Donbas instead of alternative spellings like "Donbass." The large mining region is in a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, although the coal reserves straddle the border into southern Russia.

**donkey, donkeys**

**Donnybrook** (the town); **donnybrook** (a riot)

**do-not-call list** (targeting telemarketers)

**door**

**doorbell, doorknob, doorstep, doorstop, doorway** (all fused); _but_ **door frame, door jamb, door prize** (two words)

**door** (v.), **doored, dooring** (OK as long as story's context makes meaning clear) Refers to a collision between a cyclist and the opened door of a stopped vehicle. Coined in the early 2010s, the term was initially jarring because "door" had rarely been used as a verb before. But the grammatical conversion caught on quickly, especially in public policy debates over ways to reduce cycling accidents (e.g., **dooring laws**). Quotation marks are no longer necessary based on relatively widespread usage. But use punctuation to flag more obscure terminology (e.g., teaching Canadian motorists **"the [Dutch reach](/home/d#Dutchreach)"** to reduce dooring). See also [accidents, collisions, crashes, etc.](/home/a/accidents), for related guidelines.

****dos and don'ts****

**Down Under** (Australia and New Zealand)

**downward** (_not_ downwards) See [\-ward versus -wards](/home/w/ward-versus-wards)

**dox** (v.), **doxed, doxing** (to compile and release personal information about people, including their names, addresses and phone numbers) Originally obscure internet jargon for "dropping documents." Although the term has become more widely used in recent years with the expansion of social media websites, it still requires a brief definition to make stories clear. Quotation marks, which can help flag neologisms, are optional. For consistency, prefer this original spelling over the newer "xx" version. The single "x" form is relatively entrenched, and remains the primary entry at Oxford. Efforts to combat doxing are known as **anti-doxing**.

**draconian**

**Dr.** (use for health-care professional, not PhD scholar) See [doctor](/home/d/dr) for details

**draegerman** (mine-rescue worker)

**draft** (air, money, plan, horses, beer) not draught

**DriveBC** (fused, no periods) See [**abbreviations**](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents) for handling geographical components of proper nouns (e.g., **B.C. Hydro** but **WorkSafeBC**).

**driver's licence** (singular), as in her driver's licence, a driver's licence; but **drivers' licences** (plural), as in "The province introduced enhanced drivers' licences two years ago." (See also [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe))

**drive in** (v.), **drive-in** (n.), **drive-thru** (n. and adj.), as in a "drive-thru window"

**drop-down** (adj.), **drop-down menu**

**drop out** (v.), **dropout** (n.)

**drugstore** (one word)

**drunk driving** (n.), as in Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD); **drunk-driving** (adj.), as in "a drunk-driving charge"

**drunk tank** (_avoid_ unless a jocular tone is suitable and intended) This North American colloquialism, coined in the 1940s, historically refers to police detention cells where people sober up. It was popularized on TV programs like _The Andy Griffith Show_, where a lovable town drunk would happily spend the night in a safe, warm bed. In recent decades, however, a number of public policy questions have been raised about the practice of using holding cells for cases of public intoxication — from concerns about arbitrary arrests and unjust detention to the importance of addiction treatment and the need to monitor those detained for medical risks. **"Drunk tank" remains OK in rare cases** (e.g., a profile of someone sharing a lighthearted, embarrassing college adventure). **Otherwise, generally steer clear of it**, including in stories about overall incarceration rates, evidence that certain communities are treated differently by police, allegations of systemic racism, etc.

**Druze** (preferred Canadian spelling, not _\-se_) A religious sect with roots in Islam. It's now considered an offshoot of that faith, and the group's members should be called Druze rather than Muslims. While an "s" is sometimes added for the plural form, this is unnecessary. Most Druze live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel, although there is a Canadian Druze Society as well as several provincial organizations.

**dry, drier, driest**; but **hair dryer, laundry dryer**

**Dubai, United Arab Emirates** (not "Dubayy," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**duffel bag, duffel coat**

**DUI** (driving under the influence) Limit use of this Americanism to specific U.S. contexts. Prefer the Canadian term **[impaired driving](/home/i/impaired_driving)** in virtually all other cases.

**duke, Duke of Windsor; duchess, Duchess of Cornwall** (see also [Camilla Parker Bowles](/home/p#Camilla))

**dumb** (_avoid_ this offensive description for people who cannot speak, as well as the label "mute") See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#mute)

**dumbfound**

**dumpster** (lowercase) Although once a capitalized proprietary word, it's now considered a generic term for any larger, outdoor waste bin, as in a **dumpster fire** (See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names) for related guidelines)

**Dunkirk, France** (not "Dunkerque," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**durag** (type of cloth or scarf worn on the head) The original term, coined in the 1960s, was rendered as **do-rag**, along the lines of "hairdo." In recent decades, however, numerous alternative spellings have surfaced. The most common version is now durag. Use this spelling for consistency. Since many in our audience won't be familiar with the word, regardless of vowel and punctuation choices, a brief description is generally recommended.

**durum wheat** (see [grain](/home/g/grain) for applicable capitalization guidelines)

**[dust devil](/home/w/weather-words#dustdevil)**

**Dutch reach** (lowercase "r") A way of opening parked vehicle doors that encourages shoulder checking to reduce accidents. Involves a driver or passenger using the hand farthest from the handle. The technique has been used in the Netherlands since the 1960s, although the term "Dutch reach," itself, was coined by an American physician decades later. Always explain or define in stories, and put in quotation marks to flag it as a relatively obscure coinage. (See also [**dooring**](/home/d#dooring))

**Dutch treat** (Generally avoid) For details and related guidelines, see: [gyp, Indian summer, paddy wagon, etc.](/home/g/gyp)

**DVD** (for "digital video disc," but abbreviation fine in first reference)

**DVR** (for "digital video recorder") OK in headlines and second reference

**dwarf, dwarfs** (See [plurals](/home/p/plurals)) The term dwarf is acceptable to describe someone with dwarfism, although "little person" is also OK as long as the story's context makes the meaning instantly clear. But _avoid_ the offensive label "midget." See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#dwarf)

****dye, dyeing****

**dyke** (_use_ [dike](/home/d/dike-versus-dyke) to mean barrier) See [2SLGBTQ+](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#miscellaneous "2SLGBTQ+") for guidelines on use of dyke (as in **Dyke March**)

### death general guidelines

**Death (general reporting guidelines)**

When writing about death:

-   **Follow all relevant legal guidelines** (e.g., A ban might be in place on the name of a victim if that name identified an underage suspect). When in doubt, check.


-   **Follow all applicable CBC journalistic standards** (e.g., Overly graphic details may be considered editorially unnecessary and in poor taste).


-   **Report accurately, focusing on known facts** (e.g., Just because someone is charged with murder doesn't mean the victim was murdered, which is a legal finding). See [**homicide**](/home/h/homicide) for related guidelines about specific language — from being careful with the word "murder" to avoiding relatively obscure legalese (e.g., fratricide, matricide, patricide).
-   **Be as precise as possible about the cause of death** (leukemia, lung cancer, bullet to the head) **without overwhelming our audience with medical jargon.** Exercise judgment. While terms such as "hypothermia" and "asphyxiation" are understood, context is important (the water was too cold to survive in for more than 30 minutes). Remember that there's a difference between, say, a "heart attack" (heart muscle damage) and "cardiac arrest" (stopped heart). Since a severe heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest, it's acceptable to use the common phrase "fatal heart attack." And use "die of" rather than "die from" when referring to specific illnesses (die of cancer) or conditions (die of hypothermia).


-   **Be clear when the exact cause of death is unknown** (e.g., "appears to have died of" or "is believed to have died of," if authorities are using such qualifiers). **But generally steer clear of unorthodox phrasing to convey uncertainty** (e.g., avoid using "died with" a given disease instead of "died of," because such prepositional constructions are awkward and jarring). **Instead, favour more direct language** (e.g., "Singh had tested positive for SARS, but the exact cause of death is still under investigation"). Another option is fact-based wording that uses modifiers rather than prepositions (e.g., "A SARS patient in her 20s has died, but the exact cause of death is still under investigation"). Be aware that various underlying health conditions can make individuals more susceptible to a disease. But also be aware that some people may attempt to downplay the total number of deaths during a health crisis like a pandemic for political reasons — claiming that thousands of people actually died of a comorbidity, such as obesity, severe asthma, or previous heart or lung damage, rather than of a virus. While we should be on the lookout for questionably or inaccurately calculated death totals, we should also continue to report official figures, attribute our sources, and pursue reasonably expressed skepticism about overall numbers by asking non-partisan medical authorities for comment.


-   **Report neutrally** (e.g., Avoid adding editorial comments, such as "luckily" or "fortunately" in details like "no Canadians were among the dead," and adhere to all relevant CBC language guidelines, such as a limited use of words like [terrorism](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) and care with terms such as [genocide](/home/g/genocide)). Be aware that in coverage of polarizing stories, including war, attempts to vary phrasing in stories (e.g., "died" and "were killed") can be perceived by one side or the other as biased. In these cases, it's often better to repeat the same language than to hunt for synonyms in death tolls, etc.


-   **Avoid redundancies** (e.g., The phrases "electrocuted to death" or "fatally drowned" are superfluous, since electrocution commonly implies death, and because drowning always means death; also while person X can "try to smother" person Y and fail, if person X actually "smothers" person Y, then person Y is dead).


-   **Be cautious with sensational synonyms** (e.g., slay, execute). Many of these terms are hackneyed. Some are also challenged by our audience as either inappropriate or inaccurate (e.g., The word "execution" traditionally means "executing" or "carrying out" a court-ordered or state-ordered death sentence).


-   **Generally avoid euphemisms** (e.g., "passed away," "slipped away") in daily news reporting. They're clichés. There is no outright ban against indirect language, since softer wording is sometimes the most effective choice for certain writing (e.g., in a feature or column), depending on the piece's tone. But direct wording (died, was killed, drowned, was stabbed to death) is almost always preferred.


-   **Translate military and other jargon** so that our journalism is not muddy (e.g., Tell our audience about "civilians killed" not about "collateral damage," and about "Canadian soldiers accidentally killed by a U.S. air strike" rather than about "friendly fire").


-   **Handle stories about suicide with care** (e.g., Virtually never refer to a specific death as a suicide in headlines or leads, and do not use adjectives such as "successful" or "unsuccessful"). For more details, see [suicide reporting guidelines](/home/s/suicide).


-   **In stories about [assisted dying](/home/a/assisted_dying), prefer the modifier "medical"** (e.g., medical assistance in dying, medically assisted death) **over "doctor" or "physician,"** since nurses, pharmacists and other health-care professionals may be involved.




-   Be aware that the term **[euthanasia](/home/e/euthanasia) is generally considered a poor choice for** what amounts to **"withdrawal of life-support."**

### Death-to-America

**Death to America**

This **anti-U.S. slogan** is common in parts of the Middle East. Variations of the expression directed at other countries (e.g., “Death to Israel”) are also used.

The **English translation is normally fine** unless attributed to specific person or group on record disputing the wording. For instance, the slogan Death to America is commonly heard chanted by pro-Hezbollah crowds in Lebanon. Its meaning is not contested, and the **original Arabic is unnecessary. The same generally applies to the Farsi version** (“_marg bar Amrika_”) ubiquitous in Iran for decades.

**CAVEAT: Avoid attributing this literal translation to anyone who has publicly insisted on a different, more nuanced meaning.** In those rare cases, we should **acknowledge the disagreement over wording** and ensure that an individual or group’s preferred sense is conveyed, based on the principles of accuracy and fairness.


> Example: In a speech in 2015, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the slogan essentially means “**Death to U.S. Policies**” rather than an end to the U.S., itself. Since then, the official Iranian government’s English translation has been “**Down with America**.” So while it’s OK to report on, say, crowds in Tehran chanting “Death to America,” when specifically referring to official Iranian government policy or to statements by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, we should add context and include the alternative translation.

### debt versus deficit

**Deficit versus debt**

**Deficit**
Deficit is related to the word _deficiency_. It's **a shortfall**, when **spending exceeds revenue**.

Ottawa's "annual operating deficit" is simply called "this year's deficit."

In February 1998, the federal government tabled its first budget surplus in 28 years. A decade later, the surpluses ended and a deficit of more than $30 billion was recorded during the first year of a deep recession. In 2021, Ottawa's deficit had grown to roughly $90 billion, partly because of COVID-19 pandemic emergency spending.

In times of surplus, avoid the term "fiscal dividend," which suggests a benefit (dividend) from government spending (fiscal) policy.


**Debt**
**Debt is the total amount owed at any given time.** Interest on debt is included as an expenditure in a government's budget.

Ottawa's debt (also called "**the national debt**") is **the federal government's accumulated deficits minus any surpluses applied against the principal since Confederation**. It does not include billions of dollars owed by the provinces.

In 1996, the federal debt was about $583 billion. In 2003, it was just under $508 billion. As of 2008, it had slowly declined to $458 billion. By the middle of 2010, however, the figure had suddenly swollen above $525 billion again, and was projected to keep growing. In 2021, Canada's federal debt was roughly $1.1 trillion. **This does not include billions of dollars owed by the provinces.**

**Most economists prefer to judge the size of the debt by a country's ability to pay it back** — for example, as a percentage of the national income or gross domestic product (GDP). **In news stories, however, care must be taken when citing debt-to-GDP ratios because not all analysts use the same accounting figures for government assets and liabilities.** For example, some measurements factor in billions in assets from funds like the Canada Pension Plan (i.e., "gross government debt") while others do not (i.e., they look only at "net government debt," which boils down to gross debt minus certain financial holdings). Furthermore, some metrics focus only on federal debt while others include the provinces.

When times are good, debt ratios normally fall as long as the economy grows and no sizable deficits are posted. **Be clear and precise about public finances and trends, so that our audience can assess what can be highly partisan statements by a given government as well as by its critics.** For instance, when reporting that the IMF says Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is among the lowest of all G7 countries (e.g., approximately 33 per cent in 2021), it's valuable to look farther afield for perspective (e.g., how Canada ranks compared to other industrialized countries beyond the G7, as well as whether any major fiscal changes, such as emergency spending on COVID-19 measures, have raised concerns about projected annual deficits and overall debt sustainability).


**U.S. debt ceiling**
The terms **debt ceiling and debt limit can be used interchangeably.** Although the labels, themselves, seem self-explanatory, be aware that not everyone in our audience will be familiar with the jargon. In particular, **it's important to stress that the debt ceiling has nothing to do with authorizing new spending. Rather, it's about making sure that the U.S. government can borrow enough money to meet all expenditures already authorized** by Congress or required by statute — including military spending, public employee salaries, social security and medicare benefits, tax refunds and interest on the national debt. In the spring of 2023, the U.S. debt ceiling was just over $31 trillion.

**The United States is one of the few countries in the world that operates its national government this way.** Instead of simply hashing out disagreements over spending levels during budget negotiations, **Washington has had a two-step process since 1917.** First, federal politicians vote on a budget. Then later, if there isn't enough money to pay for everything, the same politicians must raise the debt ceiling before the government can legally borrow additional money. This sometimes leads to political brinksmanship between Republicans and Democrats. **If the debt ceiling is not raised when more money is needed, financial obligations cannot be met, including payments to creditors** (i.e., interest on its debt). **This is technically known as debt default**, which economists have repeatedly warned could have devastating consequences — from triggering a recession and increasing unemployment to eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar around the world and downgrading the U.S. credit rating (making it more expensive to service the country's national debt for years to come).

### defence, labour and centre

**Defence, labour and centre**

**Rule 1**
**As outlined in the overview on [spelling](/home/s/spelling), we generally use the Canadian Oxford's preferences** (e.g., defence and centre) **for most words. This also applies to translations of proper nouns.** So while U.S. news organizations would use the term _Iraqi Civil Defense Corps_, for instance, we would write _Iraqi Civil Defence Corps_.


**Rule 2**
**We normally retain the official spelling of proper nouns in English** (e.g., the _World Trade Center_, not _Centre_). This applies to the names of political parties in English-speaking countries (i.e., to nouns that haven't been translated). So we report on Britain's _Labour Party_ but on Australia's _Labor Party_. It also includes occasional anomalous Canadian spellings, such as the _Canadian Center for Vaccinology_ in Halifax. When in doubt about an official spelling, be sure to check a reliable source.

**We alter the second rule slightly, however, when reporting on the U.S. government. We do not use the American spellings of "labor" and "defense," even in the names of departments and agencies**, because these appear relatively more frequently than the names of foreign nouns, such as Australia's Labor Party, and because they're less distinct (i.e., because more countries have "Labour Departments" than "Labour" or "Labor" parties).


This approach (also taken by CP and other news organizations), is intended to increase the level of consistent spellings within a given story — as outlined in more detail in the next section. Be aware that **U.S. news media do the same when covering our country**, referring to Canada's "Defense Department" and to a given province's "Labor Department."


**U.S. Defence Department, U.S. Labour Department**
**We want to avoid _Labor_ and _Defense_** when referring to Washington (the U.S. "Labor Department" and the U.S. "Defense Department"), not **because these words look jarring in capital letters but because of what happens when the same terms suddenly appear in lowercase** (generic contexts) **a few paragraphs later**. If we write "labour report" and "defence spending," we're inconsistent based on the earlier capital letters. If we write "labor report" and "defense spending," we're in conflict with our normal position on generic spellings. We end up with a Canadian "defence plan" and an American "defense strategy." The same approach is taken with words such as [**adviser**](/home/a#adviser) (the preferred Canadian spelling). For consistency, we should refer to a **"national security adviser"** in the U.S. or any other country (e.g., "Israel's former national security adviser"), rather than to an "advisor" in some places and an "adviser" in others.

**This style, common in Canadian journalism, distinguishes between a U.S. government department** (e.g., we write "Labour" instead of "Labor") **and a unique federal agency** within a given department (e.g., the CDC, spelled out as the U.S. national **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**).

The **same approach is taken with what amount to generic words like defence and labour in other countries' ministry headings** (e.g., "defence" in the **Israel Defence Force** rather than the Israel "Defense" Force), but "labor" without a "u" in the Israeli Labor Party, the specific name of a unique entity rather than merely a government department heading).

So it's:

**American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations** (AFL-CIO)
**Hummingbird Centre
Labor Party** (Australia)
**Labour Party** (U.K.)
**Lincoln Center
Munk Centre for International Studies
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People** (NAACP)
**Pearl Harbor
Rockefeller Center
Technicolor** (a registered [trademark](/home/t/trade-names))
_**The Color Purple**_  (film title in [italics](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/italics/ "Italics"))
**U.S. National Hurricane Center**
**World Trade Center**

But it's also:

**U.S. Labour Department**, U.S. labour statistics
the U.S. **National Labour Relations Board** (a government agency)
**U.S. Defence Department**, a defence spokesperson (_not_ Defense, defense)
**Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency** (DARP is a research arm of the Pentagon)
**Natural Resources Defence Council** (a U.S.-based environmental organization)
**U.S. National Security Adviser Jane Smith, the U.S. national security adviser** (_not_ Advisor, advisor)
the **Israel Defence Forces** (a government department, so _not_ Defense)
**Israel's national security adviser** (_not_ advisor)


**Wrong:
**_"In its own defence, the White House said that it laboured hard on the defense and labor budgets."
"Australia's Labor Party contested the Labor Department's latest labor statistics."_

**Right:**
_"In its own defence, the White House said that it laboured hard on the defence and labour budgets."
"Australia's Labor Party contested the Labour Department's latest labour statistics." (correct but jarring)
"Australia's Labor Party contested the government's latest employment statistics."_ (_rewrite to avoid spelling clashes_)

**Two mnemonic devices** may help when writing about the U.S. government:

1\. U **(you) need a "u" in labour.**
2\. Always use "c" in defence (**"c" is for Canada,** "s" is for the States).


**Centre of the World Trade Center?**
Some people have correctly pointed out that there will still be inconsistencies (e.g., the centre of the old _World Trade Center_ site). But we can generally find ways to recast such sentences (e.g., use "middle" instead of "centre" when the proper noun includes Center).

This is much harder to do this with government departments, (For instance, would we compare the Canadian and U.S. "defence budgets" or the Canadian and U.S. "defense budgets"? The answer, outlined above, is to always use "ce," whether Defence or defence.)

As for the word defensive, it's the only spelling listed in the Canadian Oxford. No one ever said English was logical or consistent (_honourable_ versus _honorary_). Our job is to present clear, accurate information. **Littering stories with inconsistent spellings of generic terms** (_labour, labor and defence, defense_) **is unhelpful and highly distracting.**

### dementia

**Dementia, senility, Alzheimer's**

**Dementia is a chronic mental disorder** marked by symptoms such as loss of memory, impaired reasoning and judgment as well as changes in personality. It has several causes, including injury, brain disease, infections and unexpected interaction of drugs in the body. The condition is sometimes treatable. [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease](/home/c/cjd) and **Alzheimer's** are two types of dementia that have received extensive media coverage over the years. [Health Canada's dementia overview](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/dementia.html) summarizes these and related neurological disorders.

**Senility, by contrast, is a colloquial term** used to describe the deteriorating mental capacity commonly associated with old age. It does not refer to a specific cause of slower mental response time, loss of memory, reduced concentration, etc., beyond age. It is not based on a brain scan or other medical diagnosis. Since people of the same age exhibit different cognitive abilities, senility is not considered a scientific label.

**Alzheimer's disease was the most common form of dementia in Canada in the early 2020s**, according to federal government research. It's named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who identified specific cellular traits of the neurological disease in 1906. Since then, treatments have been developed to try to slow progress of the disease, but there is no cure. Alzheimer's usually affects people gradually. Memory, reasoning and the ability to perform familiar tasks declines slowly. Sudden memory loss is normally associated with some other illness.

CBC News style: Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer's; an Alzheimer's treatment; etc. For consistency, do not drop the possessive apostrophe except when it's absent from a formal name, such as the [Alzheimer Society of Canada](https://alzheimer.ca/en).

### Denier

**Denier, denialism**

**Use the terms denier and denialism with caution. They convey an editorial stance.**

Just because something is widely known or believed does not guarantee that it's true. And even if it becomes incontrovertible (e.g., the earth is not flat), **it's uncommon and usually unnecessary to label people "deniers"** (e.g., virtually no one says "round earth deniers"). Instead, there are usually other ways to make the same point.

**Denier has a long history of pejorative overtone**, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (e.g., in the 1500s non-Christians were called "**Christ deniers**" and "**Gospel deniers**," and in the 1800s "**deniers of the Trinity**" surfaced). The word deny also has a close relationship with people accused of wrongdoing (to deny specific accusations). One of the few common, modern compounds involving the noun denier ("**Holocaust denier**") automatically implies antisemitism (i.e., the term telegraphs the sense of hate speech linked to people who reject the historical evidence that Nazis murdered millions of Jewish people during the Second World War). **Holocaust denier is deeply entrenched and OK** largely because society condemns the views espoused (i.e., a pejorative overtone is already implied).

Be aware, in other words, that **"denier" is not considered neutral:** It traditionally **suggests more than merely "denying" an accepted truth** or "advocating" a different view. **The noun is packed with judgment and can be perceived as demonizing.**

EXAMPLE: People who challenge widely held scientific conclusions about global warming, or specific measurements about the varying causes of global warming, are not "deniers" in the same way that fringe antisemites are "Holocaust deniers." **We don't use "climate change deniers" in our journalism for the same reason we don't classify millions of religious people** who believe in various versions of creationism **as "evolution deniers."**

The word denier, which dates back to at least the 1470s, is much older than the noun denialism. The latter was coined in the 1870s, but remained relatively rare until the late 20th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. **Denialism** is now commonly defined as "the policy or stance of denying the existence or reality of something, especially something that's supported by most widely respected scientific or historical evidence (e.g., Holocaust denialism)." **The same editorial caveats outlined for "denier" above apply to "denialism."**

In the case of climate change, **it's possible to accept some but not all scientific conclusions because of various interpretations of data** — from disputes over research methodology to data extrapolation and statistical margins of error. This includes squabbles over the estimated speed of future climate change, such as how quickly temperatures will rise, and how various ecosystems will be affected. **Such people are conventionally called critics, doubters, skeptics,** etc. Those words convey relevant detail without resorting to demonizing language. **Rather than reaching for labels, of course, it's often clearest to describe known stands** (e.g., "A third of those surveyed agree the planet is warming but dispute that human beings are largely responsible," or "are skeptical of projected timelines," or "oppose paying higher taxes to try to combat it," and so forth, depending on the views expressed in a given story).

### Department

**Department versus department**

**Always use lowercase "department" for local and business departments.** (_Halifax parks department, UBC economics department, Microsoft's sales department_.)

**Capitalize international, national and provincial government departments** (_Department of Health_), **even when abbreviated to proper-noun elements alone**. (_She held senior jobs at Finance and Defence; He worked in Foreign Affairs for 15 years._) **But use lowercase in plural constructions.** (_Expense accounts are being reviewed at the Health and Agriculture departments._)

**Be sure to include the country in the case of foreign government departments** (national and state): _the U.S. Agriculture Department_. (For more details on foreign ministries, see [Ministry versus ministry](/home/m/ministry))


**NOTE: In Canada, the official, legal names of some federal government departments are different from their common "applied" names.** See the related entry on [**ministry names**](/home/m/ministry) for details and best practices.



**Adjectives, people's titles, etc.**
**The actual names of departments are also lowercase when used as adjectives** (the _health budget_, a _finance spokesperson_, a group of _veterans affairs workers_), unless the full name appears (a _Health Canada study_, a _Treasury Board official_). Since full names are rarely used this way (e.g., _finance_ rather than _Department of Finance Canada_ and _veterans affairs_ rather than V_eterans Affairs Canada_), lowercase is more common in adjectival constructions.

**Generally avoid departmental abbreviations, even in web headlines, unless they're well known.** For instance, using _DND_ for _Defence_ is normally OK, since it's common shorthand for Canada's _Department of National Defence_. But using an obscure abbreviation such as _FOC_ for _Fisheries and Oceans Canada_ in a headline is generally confusing and ineffective. Instead, using a slightly longer but more recognizable term (e.g., the single word _Fisheries_) is normally preferred.

**Be aware that some rebranded ministry names are optional.** For example, Fisheries and Oceans Canada technically remains the [Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)](/home/f/fisheries-and-oceans) under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act. (It's also had many other names since 1867, including the Department of Naval Services and the Department of Marine and Fisheries.) Also bear in mind that some initially obscure abbreviations can gain common currency over time, such as CRA for the [Canada Revenue Agency](/home/c/canada-revenue-agency), which used to be called Revenue Canada.

**If a department's name is part of a person's current title, capitalize only when that title is _directly_ before the person's name:**


> Health _Minister Leona Aglukkaq
> _Aglukkaq, _Canada's health minister ...
> _Raj Opus, the _minister of community and cultural affairs ...
> _Takasaki, who served as _minister of transportation and public works ...
> _Hnatyshyn, a _former justice minister ..._


See also [titles](/home/t/titles) for related guidelines, including how to handle "junior" members of cabinet with secretary of state designations.

**Although the federal Treasury Board is actually a special cabinet committee, it's conventionally treated in the same way as any department.** Retain the initial capital letters even in adjectival constructions, since this is the full name:


> _Treasury Board President_ Stockwell Day
> Day, who became _president of the Treasury Board_ in January ...
> A _Treasury Board official_ said ...
> She works at the _Treasury Board_.



**'Ministry' as a synonym**
The word **"[ministry](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/ministry/ "Ministry")" is used interchangeably with "department"** in news stories. Sometimes both are left out altogether:



> **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
> ****Ministry of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
> ****Department of Fisheries and Oceans
> ****Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans****Agriculture Canada
> ****Department of National Defence
> ****Defence Department** (_not_ –se, even in the case of the U.S.)
> **Labour Department** (_not_ –or, even in the case of the U.S.)
> **German Health Ministry
> ****Transportation and Communications
> ****Transportation Department**


Be aware that some provinces and territories prefer the term "department" while some prefer the term "ministry" in official names. However, we're not obligated to try to match their arbitrary choices. The tradition of **treating the generic words "department" and "ministry" as synonyms in Canada is based on conventional usage.** This, in turn, reflects the logic that all federal, provincial and territorial government departments are all run by Crown ministers. **The fact that the default French translation of government "department" is "ministry" has also affected Canadian English over time** (e.g., in French, the formal names of the federal Department of Finance, the Department of Health and the Department of Transport are _Ministère des Finances_, _Ministère de la Santé_, and _Ministère des Transports_, respectively).

### dependant

**Dependent (adj.) versus dependant (noun)**

Although many Americans no longer spell the adjective and noun differently, a lot of Canadian and British writers still do. CBC News maintains the distinction:


**Adjective:**
_All three children are **dependent** on her for everyday needs._

**Noun:**
_Sally is still a **dependant**._

Note: **dependence** (_not_ –ance) is the **opposite of independence**.

### deserter versus resister

**military deserter versus war resister**

Someone who leaves a country's army, air force, navy or special forces without permission (i.e., without being formally discharged) is commonly called a **_deserter_**. The term is **OK in general discussions** about U.S. military personnel who have come to Canada to avoid being sent on combat assignments. **But prefer _war resister_ in stories that name people until these individuals have actually been convicted of desertion.**

While Citizenship and Immigration Canada has used the noun "military deserter" in its refugee guidelines, it acknowledges that confirming the crime of desertion in a foreign jurisdiction is complex. Parliamentary committees, meanwhile, have used "war resister." **Since there can be many reasons for desertion, the compound term war resister actually carries more meaning because it instantly conveys objection to combat duty.**

Deserters and resisters often describe themselves as **conscientious objectors.** Since that label is vague, however, **prefer specifying an individual's reasons for claiming the right to refuse military service** — which can range from religious beliefs to personal views about pacifism and morality. The term **draft dodger** refers to citizens who find ways of avoiding military service during times of conscription or mandatory draft. **They are not deserters** in the traditional sense since they were never actively enlisted in the military. In the 1960s, draft dodger was commonly applied to U.S. citizens who came to Canada to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.

### diagnosis versus prognosis

**Diagnosis versus prognosis**

**A diagnosis involves identifying a problem** based on reviewing symptoms and examining available evidence. It's a noun. The verb is diagnose. **A prognosis, by contrast, is a forecast. It's a noun.**


**Diagnosis**
Although diagnosis often refers to the investigation of a medical condition, it's a generic word that can be applied to other sources of trouble (e.g., diagnosing an electrical or mechanical fault).

**Remember: Experts diagnose problems** (e.g., illnesses, poor wiring, security breaches) **rather than things or people.**


> **Wrong**
>
> After six months of testing, they **diagnosed him** with a rare form of cancer.
>
> **Correct**
>
> After six months of testing, **a rare form of cancer was diagnosed.**

> > > > > > OR

> After six months of testing, doctors confirmed he had a rare form of cancer.

**Prognosis**
Concluding that someone has a specific disease is a diagnosis. Predicting a full recovery within 12 months is a prognosis.

**While it's acceptable to describe a prognosis as "good" or "bad" if that's the only information available, such adjectives are vague. Our audience benefits from more specific information,** such as: "She's started chemotherapy. But doctors say the odds of her living more than six months are remote."

Since prognosis involves a projection, doctors sometimes qualify how certain they are about effective treatment and recovery. If they've specified a margin of error or made their forecast conditional in some other way, always include this information in news stories.

### dike versus dyke

**Dike versus dyke**

**Use dike** (not dyke) **when referring to an embankment or ditch.** Both are legitimate spellings. But the Canadian Oxford lists dike as the preferred term.

**Generally avoid using either word** (_dike_ or _dyke_) **to describe gay women, except in established proper nouns** (e.g., Toronto's annual Dyke March) **that are considered neutral rather than derogatory.** In these cases, dyke is the preferred spelling. (See also [**2SLGBTQ+**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/ "2SLGBTQ+") for related guidelines)

### dilemma

**Dilemma**

For years, many language authorities argued that the word "dilemma" must refer to a pair of equally unpleasant options — based on the original Greek meaning ("double proposition" or "double premise"). But the word's meaning has gradually expanded over the centuries to include "**a difficult situation**." This **usage is widespread and perfectly acceptable**, according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.


Two related points:


> 1\. It's a myth that "dilemma" applies only to two choices. Given the word's roots, however, **careful writers normally limit use of dilemma to cases when the number of alternatives is relatively small, and when each possibility is both specific and unappealing.** Otherwise, a broader synonym such as **predicament** is often preferred.
>
> 2\. It's no bull that the phrase "**on the horns of a dilemma**" offers nothing to most scripts beyond the painful poke of cliché.

[External resource](/home/d/disability-language#externalresource) (federal government booklet)


**Guiding principles**

-   **Do not mention physical or mental disabilities/conditions unless they're relevant** to the story.
-   **Make sure the wording is accurate** (e.g., distinguish between temporary brain injury, permanent brain damage, mental disability and mental illness).
-   **Use meaningful language** (e.g., "people with disabilities" is clear while "passengers who need help boarding planes" could also mean the very old, the very young, the ill, someone temporarily on crutches).
-   **Avoid euphemisms** ("physically disadvantaged") **as well as dated or disputed colloquialisms** (e.g., use "joined at the waist" or "conjoined twins" rather than "Siamese twins").
-   **Add specific detail when known** rather than relying on vague labels (e.g., prefer "she can't walk because of a spinal cord injury" instead of "she's immobile," and "he has the mental capacity of a five-year-old" instead of simply "he's mentally disabled").
-   **Emphasize the person rather than the disability whenever possible** by leaning toward nouns rather than adjectives (e.g., "a person with epilepsy" rather than "an epileptic man," and "a person with schizophrenia" rather than "a schizophrenic "), **unless (i) individuals in a given story are known to have a different preference. or (ii) a given community widely leans toward a different approach** (e.g., "an autistic student" rather than "a student with autism"). Since this point comes up a lot in journalism, a longer discussion appears in the [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) section below.
-   **Embrace neutral, fact-based wording** (e.g., people "use" wheelchairs, they're not "confined" to them, and people "have" cancer, they're not "victims" of cancer).
-   **Be respectful but not patronizing, and avoid perpetuating stereotypes** (e.g., don't imply that all people with disabilities are either super-achievers, with words such as "inspirational" and "remarkable," or tragic figures, with words such as "brave" and "courageous").

**Practical application**
**Direct, neutral and meaningful language**
**To keep our journalism clear and fair, we prefer direct and neutral language.** We recognize that English evolves, and that some previously common terms are no longer considered appropriate. But **we do not automatically embrace all newly coined expressions and politically popular labels about disabilities**. Instead, we assess the pros and cons of wording, keeping in mind our overall audience as well as the specific people we're writing about.


> EXAMPLE: Describing a blind person as "visually impaired" is considered needlessly lofty and potentially offensive, equating members of the sightless community with, say, those with temporarily fuzzy vision. Calling someone "partly blind" is OK, but be aware that it can also be too vague in some cases. When details are known, and when there's room in a story, provide our audience with as much relevant information as possible. Does the man have only peripheral or blurry vision? Does the woman have only 25 per cent of her sight? If you use terms that are open to interpretation (e.g., "legally blind"), be sure to define them (e.g., "less than 10 per cent of central vision"), and keep in mind that classifications such as "legally blind" may not be pertinent unless the story deals with a dispute over, say, special transit passes or government assistance.


**Emphasizing people rather than disabilities, disorders, addictions**

**Something as subtle as choosing to use a noun** (a person with a "disability," a person with "epilepsy," a person with an "addiction") **rather than an adjective** (a "disabled" person) or **an adjective used as a noun** (an "epileptic"), **can change a story's tone.** Using a noun is commonly called **person-first writing** while using an adjective has come to be known as **identity-first writing**. Be aware that there is **no consensus on which approach is best.** Sometimes the choice of certain phrasing is obvious ("a person with bipolar disorder") because the alternative is so jarringly odd ("a bipolar disorder person"). Often, however, it boils down to individual preference. So while some Canadians insist on person-first wording (e.g., "people with disabilities"), others say they strongly prefer identity-first constructions (e.g., "disabled people") because they consider their disabilities or medical conditions to be a core part of their identities. **Whenever possible, ask those we're reporting on how they want to be described and respect those individual preferences.**

When we describe or quote people, we must always remember that they are human beings with disabilities and various medical conditions rather than disabilities or medical conditions occupying the bodies of human beings.

It is important to also be conscious of language that implies disabilities are a negative attribute or refers to them in a derogatory manner. You might think about, for example, word use that [this Government of Canada online reference](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada-regulations-guidance/consultation/inclusive-language.html#h2.2) describes as “ableist” language: “Ableism is a view or attitude that treats people without disabilities as ‘normal’ and those with disabilities as ‘abnormal,’ ‘inferior,’ or ‘other.’” **Ableist expressions are common in everyday language, but, outside of quotes, we should consider alternative wording to avoid phrases that include pejorative imagery** — for example, whether the same sentiment might be expressed in a story by using “ignore” rather than “turn a blind eye.”

Be aware that **different trends can emerge over time.** In the fall of 2022, for instance, **Autism Ontario declared its preference for "autistic person" over "person with autism,"** unless a given individual requests different usage. Polling by various research groups strongly suggests that this identity-first writing is endorsed by a large majority of autistic adults across North America. For this reason, we adjusted our approach to the word "autistic" in June of 2023. **CBC News now generally recommends "autistic" over "person with autism" in generic references, but to continue to ask for, and to respect, known preferences when reporting on individuals
**

**Specific terms**
No two stories are identical, and the general principles above are intended to help staff make individual choices. But **since some words and phrases come up more than others, the alphabetical list below provides specific direction to keep our journalism consistent.**

**able-bodied** — Usually unnecessary. People are assumed to be able-bodied unless a relevant disability is mentioned. Instead of using the general term "able-bodied," it's often best simply to specify the opposite of the disability already cited (e.g., people who can see, people who can hear, people who can walk). Another option is to say people with and without disabilities, or in some contexts [disabled people](/home/d/disability-language#disabled) and non-disabled people. Never call those without disabilities "[normal](/home/d/disability-language#normal)" or "healthy," which implies that others are abnormal or unhealthy.

**abnormal** — Offensive when applied to people. Avoid. It suggests those with disabilities fail to live up to some ideal norm or standard. It also implies that they are different in ways beyond a specific disability. See also [normal](/home/d/disability-language#normal) for limited use of that modifier to specify ranges (i.e., to describe specific abilities, such as "normal hearing," rather than to categorize people).

**accessible, accessibility** — A broad term that applies to doors with ramps, transit stations with elevators, washrooms with large stalls, etc. It's also used in descriptive compounds (e.g., **wheelchair accessible vehicles**). Accessible is the preferred adjective for special parking (**accessible parking, accessible parking permits**) as long as there's no ambiguity. For instance, a business without "accessible parking" could refer to a store on a pedestrian walkway, such as Sparks Street in Ottawa, that doesn't have parking for anyone. Make sure the context is clear. Otherwise, [disabled](#disabled) can be considered as a modifier (e.g., "disabled parking," "disabled parking permits," etc.), when referring to specific spots/passes for those who qualify. Avoid the dated term "handicapped parking."

**addict, addiction** — Prefer "people with addiction" over "addicts." See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for guidelines on emphasizing people over specific conditions, disorders, etc., as well as the [addiction overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/addiction/ "Addiction") for related caveats.

**afflicted by, suffers from, suffers with, etc.** — Avoid. These are considered pitying phrases at best and judgmentally inaccurate descriptions at worst (not all people with disabilities suffer). Use neutral verbs such as "has" (she has cancer, he has AIDS) and "is" (she is deaf, he is blind). See our **[health reporting overview](/home/h/health_reporting)** for related, general principles.

**autistic, person with autism** — While both terms are relatively common, especially in medical circles, **prefer autistic as the default choice in generic references** (e.g., autistic adults, autistic Canadians). This is known as identity-first writing, and since the early 2020s has become the form embraced by many autistic community advocacy groups. **When reporting on specific people, however, follow an individual's preference.** There's no ban against person-first writing (e.g., "children with autism"), and the phrasing can sometimes be used interchangeably with identity-first writing. Although the modifier "autistic" is increasingly used as a noun, too, including in the names of organizations (e.g., the Ontario group **Autistics for Autistics**), it's usually best to recast such syntax unless attributed (e.g., "autistic athletes competed" rather than "autistics competed"). See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for related background on adjectives and nouns, as well as [autism spectrum disorder](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/#autism "A").

**barren** — Avoid this offensive colloquialism for infertility.

**blind** — Fine as an adjective (a blind person, the blind community) or as an attributive noun (people who are blind). But generally avoid using as a noun after the definite article (the blind), which suggests they constitute a separate class within society. Use terms such as **partially sighted** or **partly blind** instead of "visually impaired," which some people find offensive because it negatively stresses a medical condition instead of neutrally identifying someone as a member of the sightless or partially sightless community. The exception is when "visually impaired" is a person's declared preference. Add detail (e.g., "He has only peripheral vision") when known and relevant. See [impaired](/home/d/disability-language#impaired) for related guidelines.

**challenged** — A weak synonym for impairment or disability that is not recommended. Prefer "mental impairment" or "[mental disability](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled)" over "mental challenge." The Canadian Oxford Guide to English Usage points out: "The term 'challenged' ... is a euphemism that has spawned jokes such as 'vertically challenged' for short people and 'sartorially challenged' for sloppy dressers. It's not recommended for serious use."

**confined** — Avoid phrases such as "confined to a wheelchair." See [wheelchair](/home/d/disability-language#wheelchairs) for details.

**congenital** — An acceptable but lofty word that means "from birth," as in a congenital disability or deformity. Prefer specific statements (e.g., blind since birth, born without arms, unable to walk since birth, born with a facial disfigurement that makes it hard to talk). When referring to specific people, avoid terms such as "birth defects," which are considered offensive because they're seen to dismiss individuals as defective rather than to neutrally report information. While general references to "birth defects" are sometimes OK (e.g., "Zika is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause birth defects"), prefer recasting such broad statements whenever possible (e.g, "Zika is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause brain damage in fetuses").

**crazy** — Offensive and judgmental. Do not use. See [mentally ill](/home/d/disability-language#mentallyill).

**cripple, crippled** — Offensive. Do not use as a noun, verb or modifier to refer to people. Although the word "cripple" remains common in other contexts (e.g., to "cripple the economy" and a "crippled industry"), careful writers avoid such usage outside of directly attributed quotes, given the term's close association with outmoded and pejorative labels for physical disabilities. Be respectful. There are numerous conversational and equally effective alternatives available, from "damage" to "hamper" and "hinder" (e.g., to "hurt the economy," a "hobbled industry").

**deaf** — Fine as an adjective in most cases (a deaf person, the deaf students), or as an attributive noun (people who are deaf). But generally avoid using as a noun after the definite article (the deaf), which suggests they constitute a separate class within society. **Deaf** (capitalized) is acceptable when referring to a culture with its own language and customs (the Deaf community). This can lead to constructions such as: "Jones, who is deaf, says she thinks the government needs to invest more in Deaf education programs." Be aware that not all members of the Deaf community use a capital D. There's also no established convention of a capital B for the blind community. Use **hard of hearing** instead of "hearing impaired" because the latter stresses a medical condition with a label rather than a person with a cultural identity. The exception is when "hearing impaired" is a person's declared preference. Another option is **partly deaf** if individuals use this wording, themselves. Be aware, however, that "partly deaf" is not as widely embraced as hard of hearing. Never use the phrase deaf and dumb. Also, avoid deaf-mute, which is inaccurate (most people who are deaf can speak) and belittling. Different sign languages are used around the world. The terms sign language interpreter or signer are common and understandable. Avoid "deaf signer," which implies the interpreter is either deaf or signing solely for those who have no hearing. See [mute](/home/d/disability-language#mute) for more details, as well as [impaired](/home/d/disability-language#impaired) for related guidelines.

**defects, birth defects** — Avoid when referring to specific people or groups. See [congenital](/home/d/disability-language#congenital).

**developmentally impaired** — A term that's often too vague to be helpful since it can cover everything from physical and mental development to emotional maturity, acquisition of basic social skills, etc. There's also debate over how to apply this phrase accurately (e.g., restricted to those under 18 or also OK for certain adults). Prefer more specific language that conveys relevant detail about a mental or physical disability, such as [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled).

**diabetic** — While "people with diabetes" is preferred when practical, "diabetic" is common and acceptable. See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for more details about adjectives and nouns.

**disabled, disability** — Use "disabled" as an adjective (disabled Canadians) or as an attributive noun (people who are disabled). Avoid as a noun after the definite article (the disabled), which suggests they constitute a separate class within society. See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for guidelines on emphasizing people over specific conditions, disorders, etc. The term disability can be used as a synonym for impairment (e.g., "mental disability"). Although disabled is sometimes fine as a modifier, it should not be used inaptly (e.g., use stalled or stopped rather than "disabled" when referring to a vehicle that's not running, and use **injury list** rather than "disabled list" when referring to hurt athletes removed from an active roster while recovering). Also, prefer fact-based phrasing like **wheelchair accessible buses** over "disabled buses" as long as the meaning is clear (see [**accessible parking**](#accessible) for details). Distinguishing between specific disabilities (functional limitations, such as not being able to walk) and diseases or other medical conditions (arthritis, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's) is sometimes important, since there can be a range of impairment that changes over time. Avoid the dated term [handicapped](/home/d/disability-language#handicapped). See also [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled) for related guidelines.
**
disabled parking, disabled parking permits** — See [accessible](/home/d/disability-language#accessible)

**disadvantaged** — Avoid this unclear euphemism. When reporting on specific problems facing people with disabilities (e.g., lack of accessible public transit), it's fine to point out specific obstacles or disadvantages. But use [disabled](/home/d/disability-language#disabled) when actually referring to physical or mental disabilities.

**dumb** — Offensive. Do not use. See [mute](/home/d/disability-language#mute).

**dwarf, dwarfs, dwarfism** — The term "dwarf" (plural dwarfs not dwarves) is an acceptable term immediately understood by our audience. It's based on the name of a medical condition: dwarfism. Do not use midget. While some advocacy groups in Canada and abroad recommend "little people," that generic compound is normally too vague for news stories. Consider using little people, however, if the context makes the meaning clear. When known, a specific height is a valuable detail. Dwarfism is commonly defined as a medical or genetic condition that leaves adult men and women under 4-10, with the average height closer to four feet.

**dyslexic, dyslexia** — While "people with dyslexia" is the preferred construction when practical, "dyslexic" is OK as an attributive noun (e.g., "people who are dyslexic" and "he is dyslexic"). But do not use it as a noun alone (e.g., Canadian dyslexics). Dyslexia can be described as a [learning disability](/home/d/disability-language#learningdisability).

**epileptic, epilepsy** — While "people with epilepsy" is preferred when practical, "epileptic" is common and acceptable. See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for more details about nouns and adjectives. People with epilepsy have [seizures](/home/d/disability-language#seizure) not fits, spells, etc.

**handicapped** — Although once very common, the term is now dated and considered offensive, with overtones of "hand-in-cap" begging. There's also the complaint that the word exaggerates limitations (e.g., a person in wheelchair is not handicapped in a workplace if there's a ramp at the door and accessible facilities, including washrooms). Prefer the more neutral word [disabled](/home/d/disability-language#disabled) and its variations (e.g., person with a disability). Note: In golf stories, the entrenched use of numerical "handicaps" to gauge amateur players' abilities is fine.

**hearing impaired** — Avoid. See [deaf, partly deaf](/home/d/disability-language#deaf)

**impaired, impairment** — Acceptable as synonyms for disabled, disability in certain cases, especially when a medical condition is being stressed (e.g., a cognitive impairment). While the word "impaired" usually suggests either partial loss of an ability or a correctable problem, be aware that it can be offensive to people who think it needlessly labels them. Someone who can't see anything is blind, for instance, while someone who has less than full sight is partly blind. Referring to them as "visually impaired" can suggest they're no different from someone with temporarily blurry vision caused by eye drops at an optometrist's office. See also [disabled](/home/d/disability-language#disabled).

**invalid** — Avoid. Originally meant "not strong," especially of wounded soldiers unfit to return to battle. Today, the word invalid suggests not only frailty but also helplessness. It's insulting and inaccurate to label people with disabilities as weak and unable to take care of themselves. See [handicapped](/home/d/disability-language#handicapped) for a similar caveat.

**insane, insanity** — Avoid except when tied to a confirmed medical diagnosis. In court cases, insanity or other language that refers to mental competence may require a legal finding. It's OK to report that a lawyer is arguing that her client was temporarily insane or mentally unfit when a crime was committed, as long as suitable attribution is given. But baldly describing someone as [mentally ill](/home/d/disability-language#mentallyill) is potentially libellous (e.g., just because someone has spent time in a psychiatric ward does not mean they are mentally ill).

**intellectually disabled** — OK when preferred by a given person or group, but prefer [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled) or mentally impaired in general, public policy coverage. 

**learning disability** — OK when specifically referring to a learning disability, such as [dyslexia](/home/d/disability-language#dyslexic). But don't use as a vague euphemism for [mental disability](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled) (general cognitive impairment). Keep in mind that someone can have a very high IQ but still have some sort of perpetual learning problem. Avoid the awkward noun "learning disabled." Prefer saying that the person has a learning disability. And always define unfamiliar jargon (e.g., say that someone has trouble remembering certain words or names rather than reporting that they have "anomic aphasia"). See also [special needs](/home/d/disability-language#specialneeds).

**mental** — Do not use. Offensive. But see [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled) for acceptable terms.

**mentally disabled, mentally impaired** — Common and acceptable terms covering a range of cognitive impairment, from low intelligence, slow brain processing and the inability to retain and recall information to difficulty developing language and basic problem-solving skills. But avoid using after the definite article (the mentally disabled, the mentally impaired), which suggests they constitute a separate class within society. The phrase mentally challenged is euphemistic and not recommended (see [challenged](/home/d/disability-language#challenged) above). The term **intellectually disabled** is OK when preferred by a given group or person. But keep in mind that "intellectually disabled" is sometimes a poor choice, especially in general coverage, because it narrowly refers to intelligence. While cognitively disabled is accurate, it's less conversational. Keep in mind that these are all relatively broad labels. When known, it's better to supply specific information (e.g., a person has [Down syndrome](/home/d#downsyndrome)). This includes differentiating between mental disability from birth, temporary or permanent brain damage at some point after birth, and diseases that affect memory and other brain function (e.g., if someone has advanced [Alzheimer's](/home/d/dementia), we should explain this in a story rather describe them as mentally impaired). Do not use the offensive slang "mental." See [retarded](/home/d/disability-language#retarded) for an important, related caution. Also, keep in mind that mentally disabled is not the same as [mentally ill](/home/d/disability-language#mentallyill).

**mentally ill** — This requires psychiatric or psychological testing and diagnosis. It refers to insanity, mental instability, depression, schizophrenia, etc. By contrast, someone who has an extremely low IQ, a medical disorder such as Down syndrome, etc., is [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled). The compound **mental illness** is common, neutral and factual. Just as we talk about **physical health**, we also refer to **mental health**. Indeed, virtually all provinces have the equivalent of a Mental Health Act. Since terms like mentally ill and insane are potentially libellous, they require special caution (e.g., just because someone has been ordered to undergo psychiatric testing does not mean they are mentally ill). See also [insanity](/home/d/disability-language#insane).

**midget** — Avoid. Considered highly offensive. See [dwarf, dwarfs](/home/d/disability-language#dwarf).

**mute** — Avoid. The label is considered belittling. And never use deaf-mute or deaf and dumb. If someone cannot speak and it's relevant to the story, simply report this fact. But consider framing the detail in a less negative or judgmental way by emphasizing what they can do, as opposed to what they can't (e.g., that they communicate with sign language, with a voice synthesizer, with pen and paper, with the help of a computer). See also [deaf](/home/d/disability-language#deaf) for related guidelines.

**non-disabled** — OK to mean people without disabilities. See [able-bodied](/home/d/disability-language#ablebodied) for details.

**normal** — Never refer to people without disabilities as normal. But the term is OK in general descriptions of specific abilities (e.g., normal vision, near-normal hearing), since it can helpfully and neutrally indicate ranges. See also [able-bodied](/home/d/disability-language#ablebodied).

**paraplegic** — Entrenched and acceptable as a noun (a paraplegic) and as an adjective (paraplegic research), and as an attributive noun (people who are paraplegics). These constructions are much more direct and conversational than alternatives, such as "people with paraplegia." If labels can be avoided, however, prefer reporting descriptive facts (e.g., she's paralyzed from the waist down, her legs are paralyzed, she can't walk).

**quadriplegic** — Entrenched and acceptable as a noun (a quadriplegic) and as an adjective (a quadriplegic specialist), and as an attributive noun (people who are quadriplegics). These constructions are much more direct and conversational than alternatives, such as "people with quadriplegia." If labels can be avoided, however, prefer reporting descriptive facts (e.g., she's paralyzed from the neck down, her arms and legs are paralyzed, she can't move any of her limbs).

**retard, retarded, mentally retarded** — Do not use. Although terms such as retardation and mental retardation remain common in some parts of the world, they are now considered highly offensive in Canada. It's irrelevant that retard simply means "slow" in Latin (the etymology is sometimes cited as an objective and effective way to communicate delayed mental development). It also doesn't matter that the clinical diagnosis of "mental retardation" is still found in respected medical journals. Connotation can be as important as denotation when judging what's appropriate in our journalism, and constructions such as "mentally retarded" are instantly linked to "retard" and other highly objectionable slang. Instead, use [mentally disabled](/home/d/disability-language#learningdisability) or mentally impaired. Even the verb is best avoided unless attributed (e.g., "to retard growth"), along the lines of [cripple](/home/d/disability-language#cripple).

**schizophrenic** — Prefer "people with schizophrenia" over "schizophrenic person." (See [practical application](/home/d/disability-language#nounsvsadjectives) above for more details about adjectives and nouns.) Schizophrenia is a [mental illness](/home/d/disability-language#mentallyill). Its symptoms vary, but can include confusion, delusion and paranoia. Limit use of schizophrenia to its medical meaning of psychosis. Never toss it around as a fancy description for someone who is merely inconsistent, undecided, etc.

**seeing eye dog** — Generally prefer [service dog or service animal](/home/d/disability-language#servicedog), especially in generic references.

**seizure** — This is the proper term to describe the convulsions or blackouts that people with epilepsy have. Avoid terms such as fits, attacks, spells, etc. See also [epilepsy](/home/d/disability-language#epilepsy).

**service dog, service animal** — Preferred terms for dogs that have been specially trained to help people with various disabilities. While service dogs may well help guide individuals who are blind, they sometimes also perform other work, depending on their background — from assisting people who are deaf to pulling wheelchairs, from barking for aid during seizures to calming those having anxiety attacks. For this reason, a broad compound like "service dog" is generally recommended over narrower labels, such as "seeing eye dog" and "guide dog," especially in generic references.

**special needs** — Generally avoid this vague and potentially pejorative euphemism unless it's part of direct quote or a proper noun equivalent (e.g., the name of a school program) and the context makes the meaning clear. Direct attribution is recommended because the expression is increasingly regarded as a dysphemism (i.e., roundabout language more offensive than the original terminology). In generic references, prefer "people with disabilities" over "people with special needs." In narrower references, prefer fact-based details about the disabilities (cognitive, physical, etc.). Saying that someone has special needs raises more questions than it answers. By contrast, saying that someone is in a wheelchair, needs a voice synthesizer to speak or reads at a Grade 2 level helps our audience understand the story we're telling. See also [learning disability](/home/d/disability-language#learningdisability).
**
speech impairment, speech impediment** — Acceptable but vague terms. Prefer specific information, such as a stammer, a cleft palate, a strong lisp, etc. As with all other parts of the story, such detail must be relevant. And never assume someone has a specific condition. A nervous person who stutters a few times during one speech you happened to hear may, in fact, not have a speech impediment.

**suffers from, suffers with** — Avoid. See [afflicted](/home/d/disability-language#afflicted) by for details, including similar phrases considered inappropriate.


**the** (as in the blind, the deaf, the disabled) — Avoid these constructions, which suggest people form separate groups within society based on specific mental or physical conditions. Instead of using the definite article followed by a noun (the blind), use attributive nouns (people who are blind) or adjectives (a blind person). For more details about specific wording, see the relevant entry (e.g., [blind](/home/d/disability-language#blind), [deaf](/home/d/disability-language#deaf), [disabled](/home/d/disability-language#disabled)).
**
visually impaired** — Avoid. See [blind, partly blind](/home/d/disability-language#blind).

**wheelchairs** — Avoid phrases such as "confined to a wheelchair" and "wheelchair-bound." Many people who use wheelchairs consider them mobilizing not confining. There's also the issue of accuracy, since some people in wheelchairs do have other options, including periodic use of canes and walkers. And be sure that all details you include are relevant. Just because someone is in a wheelchair does not mean that this fact needs to be pointed out in the story.


**External resource: Tips for the media covering people with disabilities**
Before tackling specific words and phrases, we make key decisions about story focus and structure. So **when featuring someone with a disability in our journalism, ask:**

-   **Are we pursuing the story because it involves someone with a disability or because it's of interest to the general population?**
-   **Have we picked the best focus?** Concentrating on the obvious human-interest angle (e.g., how a person has overcome great odds) may be clichéd. It can also overshadow issues that haven't received as much attention over the years (e.g., unemployment, income barriers, lack of accessibility to facilities).
-   **Is reference to the disability even necessary?**

Since diversity of voices is important, **we should also reflect on a more general question as all stories are pitched and assigned:**

-   **Are people with disabilities routinely asked for their views about a wide range of topics** — not necessarily because they bring unique perspectives but simply because they're citizens who want to participate in conversations about health care, child care, transportation, the environment, etc., too?

 For more on these and other tips for the media — including advice about interviews — see [Inclusive Language in Media: A Canadian Style Guide](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.humber.ca%2Fmakingaccessiblemedia%2Fmodules%2F06%2Ftransript%2FFinal_Glossary.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw35Dl4_vnX26bzKzqqJIixy) published in 2017 by Humber College, as well as a 2006 federal government booklet, [A Way with Words and Images: Suggestions for the Portrayal of People with Disabilities](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/uyuh3fmh/a_way_with_words_and_images_disabilities_portrayal_gofcanada.pdf "A Way With Words And Images Disabilities Portrayal GofCanada").

### disease\_illness

**Disease, disorder, illness, etc.**

There's **overlap between some broad medical labels**, but there are **also distinctions worth noting.**

**Here are a few key points to keep in mind** when using the following common terms:


**condition —** Can refer to overall health (e.g., "their medical condition is good"), as well as to status after injury, surgery, and so forth (e.g., "her condition is stable"). Condition is also commonly used as a synonym for certain diseases, disorders, etc. (e.g., acne is a common skin condition, high blood pressure is a long-term medical condition), An **acute condition is short-lived** (e.g., less than six months), often appears suddenly and can be severe. A **chronic condition lasts longer** (often years), and is sometimes terminal.


**disease —** Describes a **wide array of illnesses**, not just those caused by micro-organisms. The word's **definition is so broad**, in fact, **that it covers virtually anything beyond physical injury that makes a living organism act abnormally**. Technically, therefore, even poisoning is a type of disease. But that's not how the term is commonly used. And it can be unnecessarily confusing to our audience to label, say, exposure to radiation at work an "occupational disease," or to refer to illness from contaminated fruits and vegetables a "food borne disease." Some **common disease classifications** are **infectious** (e.g., hepatitis C, malaria, tuberculosis), **metabolic** (e.g., diabetes, thyroid disease, liver disease), **vascular** (e.g., narrowed or blocked arteries, damaged blood cells) and **degenerative** (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and osteoarthritis). **Other than "infectious," however, specific modifiers are not routinely used in general news reporting**. If someone is born with a specific disease, disorder or condition, it's **congenital**. If it surfaces later and is deemed hereditary, it's commonly called **genetic**. Sometimes, the word "disease" is dropped from a name, especially when more is known about causes and treatments (Hodgkin's lymphoma has largely replaced Hodgkin's disease). This does not automatically mean, however, that the word "disease" is inaccurate (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer, which, by definition, means it's a disease).


**disorder —** Frequently and **acceptably used as a synonym for certain diseases, especially non-infectious diseases** (e.g., a kidney disorder, a sleeping disorder, a psychiatric disorder). **Sometimes, disorder is more narrowly defined** as an identifiable symptom of an overall condition or disease (e.g., arrhythmia, also known as an irregular heartbeat, is a disorder that normally falls under the bigger umbrella of cardiovascular disease). **Be aware that there's a growing trend by certain groups to prefer "disorder" over "disease" because the latter term is viewed as comparatively negative**. Since the two words are now increasingly used interchangeably, there's no need to insist on "disease" when "disorder" is more common in specific contexts.


**illness —** Common and **acceptable as a general label for certain diseases, disorders, etc.** (e.g., "she rarely complains about her illness"). **However, the word is often used in a more narrow way that conveys the sense of specific symptoms** (e.g., difficulty breathing, partial paralysis, vomiting, cognitive impairment). When someone is fighting the flu, for instance, they're described as "ill" or "sick" because they have various flu symptoms, such as fever, sinus congestion and a sore throat. **This sense of "illness" can be useful in certain reporting**, because not everyone who has a given disease, or who is carrying a virus that causes a given disease, will exhibit symptoms right away. **One can have a disease** (e.g., some forms of cancer) **without experiencing illness for months or years**. Just as with the word "disorder" above, **be aware that there's a growing trend by certain people to prefer "illness" over "disease" because the latter term is viewed as comparatively negative.** Although the two words are often used interchangeably, there's no need to insist on "disease" when "illness" is more common in specific contexts. At the same time, there's no reason to abandon entrenched language (e.g., STD for "sexually transmitted disease") and to insist on a variation (e.g., STI for "sexually transmitted illness") solely because some individuals prefer describing, say, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, etc., in one way (as STIs) but not in another, equally accurate way (as STDs). When faced with two or more acceptable choices, **generally prefer language familiar to our audience, and be consistent within a given story.**


**sickness —** A colloquial and **acceptable term to describe some illnesses**, especially **routine bacterial infections** (e.g., strep throat) **and viral infections** (e.g., the common cold). **Avoid in the context of mental illnesses** (e.g., "sick in the head"), which can trivialize serious health problems, including various psychiatric disorders.


**syndrome —** A set of **symptoms tied to a specific disorder, disease or condition**. In the case of new illnesses, **the word is sometimes used early on to describe an unnamed cluster of symptoms** (e.g., [AIDS](/home/a/aids), for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the early 1980s, and [SARS](/home/s/sars) for severe acute respiratory syndrome two decades later). **Unless names are self-explanatory** (e.g., dry eye syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome), **they should be defined**. Sometimes, the names are based on proper nouns (e.g., Down syndrome). Certain psychiatric conditions or psychological behaviour can fall into this category (e.g., hostages displaying signs of sympathy toward their captors is conventionally known as Stockholm syndrome).


**symptom —** A **sign of a possible medical problem** (e.g., severe headache, pain, numbness). **Distinctions are sometimes made between objective, observable "signs"** (e.g., fever, coughing) **and subjective, descriptive "symptoms"** sensed only by the patient (e.g., tiredness, sadness). Unless detail about symptom measurability is central to a given story, it's perfectly acceptable to use "symptom" and "sign" synonymously.

See also [health reporting](/home/h/health_reporting) (diseases, medical conditions, etc.) for general guidelines about accuracy (e.g., epidemic versus pandemic), clarity, respect, and so forth, including how to handle sometimes disputed terms like "battling cancer" and "survivor."

See also [disability language](/home/d/disability-language) (e.g., avoid "afflicted by" and "suffers from"), which includes an overview of our default practice of emphasizing people rather than disabilities whenever practical (e.g., a "person with epilepsy" rather than "an epileptic").



### Crimea

**Donbas (Donetsk, Luhansk)**

**Donbas is a disputed region between southeastern Ukraine and Russia**, where Ukrainian government forces have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014. **It can be accurately called a conflict zone.** Donbas is short for **Donets Coal Basin**, but this does not need to be spelled out in news stories. The industrial area has been known for its coal mining and steel manufacturing since the mid-1800s.

**The region has effectively been divided since 2015.** Kyiv controls the western parts, while **two separatist factions control the eastern parts, which they've named the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).** The eastern areas include major cities like Donetsk and Luhansk as well as the border with Russia. Although widely recognized as part of Ukraine by much of the world, many of the region's Russian-speaking citizens no longer consider themselves Ukrainians. **To make clear which areas are not run by government forces, use phrasing such as separatist-controlled or rebel-controlled.**

The exact boundaries of Donbas are a source of debate. In most news stories, the proper noun normally refers to **two neighboring administrative regions: Donetsk and Luhansk.** It's **a common practice simply to report on whatever region applies, rather than to Donbas as a whole** (e.g., we might refer to increased fighting in Donetsk). Be aware that such regions are sometimes called oblasts, based on old Soviet Union terminology. Since each oblast has a city with the same name, **it can be helpful to specify what is meant by a given proper noun** (e.g., the **Donetsk region** versus the **city of Donetsk**), unless the meaning is obvious from context. Although the word "oblast" is in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, it's relatively obscure and, so, does not need to be used.

**Attribute anything contested**
As with coverage of any disputed territory, **our journalism should be fact-based and reflect the realities on the ground.** This includes how we report geographical detail (e.g., use **"Donetsk" rather than "Donetsk, Ukraine"**). Stories can provide additional information whenever practical, but it's unrealistic to expect something as succinct as, say, a TV locator to capture the subtleties and complexities of fluid territorial fighting.

**Roughly seven months after invading other parts of Ukraine in February 2022**, including land along the country's northern, eastern and southern borders, **Moscow announced that it was formally annexing Donetsk, Luhansk and** two other regions held by Russian troops farther south: **Kherson and Zaporizhzhia**..The move came after hastily organized referendums that Kyiv and most of the international community called illegitimate. It's accurate to refer to the ongoing fighting as **Russia's [war](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-terms-overview/#war "Military terms overview") in Ukraine**, **Russia's [invasion](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-terms-overview/#invasion "Military terms overview") of Ukraine**, etc., as well as to **Russian-occupied territory**, and to **widely denounced referendums, unrecognized referendums, contested annexations, self-declared annexations, repudiated annexations**, etc.

Use attribution to flag contested proper nouns, including DPR and LPR. **Phrasing such as "self-proclaimed" or "self-declared" or "which calls itself" is recommended.** For example, over TV footage of soldiers, we might say something like, "Pro-Russian militants with the **self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic** can be seen conducting combat exercises." When practical, providing additional detail can help our audience understand the bigger picture (e.g., **pro-Russian groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 after disputed referendums** that most of the international community dismissed as illegitimate).

**Prefer the entrenched spellings Donbas, Donetsk and Luhansk.** Avoid other transliterations such as "Doneck" and "Lugansk." See also [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names) and [Russian names](/home/r/russian-names)


See **[Crimea](/home/c/Crimea)** for related guidelines (e.g., it's accurate to refer to Russia's annexation and occupation of Crimea, but misleading to refer to an "invasion").

### Dr.

**Dr.**

[Avoid gender bias](/home/d/dr#Dr-PhD-gender) (The pros of 'Prof.' for PhDs)

**Apply 'Dr.' to licensed health-care professionals only**
Reserve the honorific Dr. for licensed health-care professionals. **Our style is not intended to diminish the effort needed to get a PhD in any particular discipline. Rather, it's designed to help our audience quickly identify people in the health-care field who are commonly referred to as "doctors."**

In Canada, individual provinces determine which health-care professionals are able to use the honorific "Dr." Legislation, such as [Ontario's Regulated Health Professions Act](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontario.ca%2Flaws%2Fstatute%2F91r18%23BK31&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3RVmMvR6jlbmYiH65bOBx7), specifies who is eligible. **The list of health-care professionals used by CBC News features the most common categories:**

> **dentists**
>
> **chiropractors**
>
> **optometrists**
>
> **physicians** (including **psychiatrists**) **and surgeons**
>
> **psychologists**
>
> **veterinarians**


Veterinarians are conventionally called doctors because they perform the equivalent work of MDs on animals, including surgery.

**Never imply that people are licensed medical doctors when they're not.** This normally means specifying whether someone is a dentist, optometrist, chiropractor, etc., high in the story.

**A person's specific job** (e.g., virologist, microbiologist) **or employer** (e.g., Public Health Agency of Canada, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science) **does not determine whether "Dr." applies**. For example, if the head of the World Health Organization is a research scientist with a PhD in community health, do not include "Dr." before the name. If the person has an MD, by contrast, add the honorific.

**In the case of PhDs, it's often simplest and clearest to describe a person's job or specialization** ("U of T history Prof. Bert Reith" or "Bert Reith, who teaches history at the University of Toronto" but NOT "Dr. Bert Reith"). **Licensed psychologists are an exception to the PhD rule** because they are considered health-care professionals. **Stick to one honorific per person** (e.g., if an epidemiologist has an MD as well as a PhD, there's no need to add "Prof." before her name when she's already called "Dr.").


**GENDER BIAS CAUTION:** (1) **Ensure that women and men are treated in the same way** (e.g., if one person with an MD in a story is called "Dr." then everyone with an MD in the same report should be called "Dr."); and (2) **Avoid even the perception of gender discrimination when distinguishing between MDs and PhDs**. In particular, **be aware that referring only to men as "Dr." in a story can unintentionally telegraph a misleading message about women in the same report** when the former have MDs and the latter have PhDs — **especially since not everyone in our audience will be familiar with our approach to the honorific.** In 2020, for example, we received more than one ombudsman complaint about COVID-19 coverage that happened to quote male medical doctors (who were all called "Dr.") and female scientists with PhDs (who were not given comparable abbreviated titles before their names in the same stories). **PREFER PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION in such cases by adding applicable detail** (e.g., use "**Prof.**" or "**Assoc. Prof.**" or whatever title is accurate for the person with a PhD, and "**Dr.**" for the person with an MD). **This does not mean that we must always use a job description like "Prof." before scholars' names** solely because they teach at colleges or universities. That would be too formulaic and restrictive. **But in coverage featuring some people with MDs and some people with PhDs, we should use wording that steers clear of even the appearance of gender bias.**



**Prefer specific detail over vague honorifics**
**Since there are so many different types of doctors, it's important to put someone's credentials in context.** Is she a family doctor? An infectious disease specialist? A psychologist with expertise in counselling young victims of sexual abuse? **If a person's health-care qualifications are clear in a story, the honorific Dr. can be dropped** (e.g., "Vancouver dermatologist Azeeza Khan called the research alarming" rather than "Vancouver dermatologist Dr. Azeeza Khan called the research alarming").

**Be certain you understand all labels used** (e.g., a psychiatrist has an MD while a psychologist does not, an ophthalmologist has an MD while an optometrist does not, and the noun [anesthesiologist](/home/a/anesthesiologist-versus-anesthetist) is generally preferred over "anesthetist" in Canada). **In the case of naturopaths, avoid the honorific "Dr."** (e.g., "naturopath Joyce Wong" rather than "naturopathic Dr. Joyce Wong"). Add specific professional affiliations when these are relevant and there's room in the story (e.g., "Wong, a member of the Ontario Association of Naturopathic Doctors, ...").

**Even when someone has a medical degree, don't bother mentioning this fact unless it's relevant to the story:** "Maria Mendez urged council not to increase property taxes" rather than "Dr. Maria Mendez urged council...." If an MP has an MD, for instance, we would still write "MP Joan Johnson" unless she was commenting on a health-care issue.


**Keep news writing conversational**
**Since honorifics can be awkward on air, using "Dr." is optional.** Writing clearly and effectively for a given medium sometimes means restructuring sentences. In the case of "Dr.," what works on the web ("Dr. Bill Jones, a Charlottetown cardiologist") or in a television super may be better recast in an on-air script ("Bill Jones is a cardiologist in Charlottetown"). **Even on the web, where words are written for the eye rather than for the ear, the title Dr. may be clunky.** For example, "MP Dr. Joan Johnson" is a dense pileup. Instead, relevant detail about the member of Parliament's professional credentials can be introduced another way: "MP Joan Johnson, a family doctor from Swift Current, Sask., says many rural centres are having trouble recruiting physicians." Our audience's best interests should be served.

**When referring to medical specialists, common terms do not need to be defined** (e.g., cardiologist, neurologist). **But brief explanations are helpful for more obscure terms** (endocrinologist, gastroenterologist).

**Not all doctors are certified surgeons,** even if they are specialists in certain fields of medicine. A cardiologist is not necessarily a heart surgeon, for example, and a neurologist is not necessarily a brain surgeon. **Do not use the word "surgeon" unless it applies.** While there's no universally accepted definition of surgery, we can apply common sense. Amputating a leg, removing a tumour, taking out an appendix or tonsils, etc., are all examples of surgery. Removing a mole, draining a cyst, etc., are generally not. Instead, these are more broadly referred to as "medical procedures." A doctor called on in an emergency to remove a bullet is a physician performing surgery. A doctor performing a quadruple bypass, on the other hand, is almost certainly a cardiac surgeon. The conventional term "cosmetic surgery" is acceptable, and normally describes altering or restoring a person's appearance. If facts are in dispute, or if there's debate over who can legally call themselves "cosmetic surgeons" in a particular jurisdiction, be sure to make this clear in the story.

If you introduce someone as a doctor and then several paragraphs pass before the person is mentioned again, the term "Dr." is a good way to remind readers, listeners and viewers about the individual's qualifications ("Dr. Low believes ..."). Otherwise, family names are sufficient in subsequent reference ("Low believes ..."). **The word doctor is always spelled out unless it appears directly in front of a name.**

When a person's medical credentials are relevant to a given story, **it's an accepted convention to use the title Dr. even after people retire or die** (e.g., Dr. Frederick Banting). **Exceptions are when people have been formally stripped of their licences** because of improper conduct. To avoid audience confusion, it's helpful to point out when someone is no longer practising medicine by adding a suitable modifier in first reference (e.g., "retired Dr. Nirmala Khatri")

### the Deity and the devil

**the Deity and the devil**

**Capitalize sacred names in monotheistic religions, as well as the proper names and nicknames of the devil:**

God, Adonai, Allah, Yahweh, the Almighty, the Deity, the Father, Jesus Christ, the Son, the Lamb of God, the Saviour, our Lord, Holy Spirit, Trinity, the Prophet (Muhammad), Virgin Mary, Archangel Michael, Angel Gabriel, Satan, Lucifer, Old Nick, Father of Lies, etc.

Capitalize He, Him, His, Thou, Thee, Thine, You, Your in reference to the Deity, but lowercase who, whom, and whose.

**E** 

**e-el**
**e-bike, e-book, e-cash, e-commerce, e-health, e-learning, e-passport, e-reader, e-trade, [e-waste](/home/e#ewaste), etc.,** but **email** and [**esports**](/home/e#esports) (fused) based on entrenched convention, as well as **eHealth Ontario** and **ePub** files (ePub file format) because these are treated as proper nouns with [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) along the lines of eBay. Although e- normally means "electronic," it sometimes stands for "electrical" (e.g., an e-bike). See [electrical versus electronic](/home/e#electrical) below. For details on e-book versus email, see general guidelines on [hyphens in compounds](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#email).

**e-cigarette** (OK in all references to an electronic cigarette) Common name for pen-shaped vaporizers. The portable, battery-powered devices produce aerosol mist by heating a range of different solutions (**e-liquid, e-juice**, etc.) housed in refillable or replaceable cartridges. While it's OK to refer to people "smoking" e-cigarettes, the participle "vaping" can be clearer because it distinguishes between the traditional burning of tobacco and the vaporizing of cartridge liquid.

**each other, each other's** (see [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe))

**early 1970s, early 1990s**, etc. (_no hyphen_) See also [time](/home/t/time) for mid-1940s, etc.

[**earthquakes**](/home/e/earthquakes) (Use "magnitude" not "Richter scale")

**Earth Day** (capitalized) See [holidays and other special times](/home/h/holidays)

**East, Eastern** versus **east, eastern** (See [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west))

**East Block** (Ottawa)

**Easter**

East Indian (_Avoid_) Use **Indian** or **South Asian**, depending on context. (See [South Asian, Indian, Indo-Canadian](/home/s/south-asian-indian-indo-canadian) for detailed guidelines)

**East Jerusalem** (annexed by Israel after the 1967 war) Use the word "occupied" if an adjective is needed in a story (**occupied East Jerusalem**). Other terms, such as "disputed," are too imprecise. Israel regards Jerusalem as a united city and an integral part of its country. But the view is not widely shared. Canada, the United States, Britain, the European Union and most other members of the international community do not recognize the annexation of East Jerusalem. They consider it occupied territory, like the West Bank. See the [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary) for detailed guidelines about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

**East TImor** (usually OK in first and subsequent references) There's usually no need to use the formal name of the **Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste**. If Timor-Leste is included in stories, it should be explained (e.g., "commonly known as East Timor"). See compass points in [country names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/g/geography-cities/#country-names "Geography cities") for related guidelines (e.g., North Korea, South Korea).

[**East Sea** also known as the **Sea of Japan**](/home/s/sea-of-japan_east-sea) (Guidelines outline our use of both names for the body of water between Japan and the Korean Peninsula)

**Eastern Townships** (Quebec)

**Eaton’s** (the old T. Eaton Co. Ltd. is now defunct)

**eBay** (See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

**Ebola virus**

**e-bike** (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above) When spelling out or defining, be sure to call them "electric" or "electrically powered bicycles," not "electronic" or "electronically powered." See [electrical versus electronic](/home/e#electrical) below.

**e-book** (see **[e-](/home/e#e-)** above)

****echo, echoes****

**EcoDensity Charter, EcoDensity** (abridged proper noun OK, as in "the EcoDensity debate," and "Vancouver's EcoDensity plan calls for greater housing density to reduce sprawl and energy use")

**E. coli** (capital E, period, no hyphen, lowercase c, no italics) Stands for the bacteria Escherichia coli, but E. coli is fine in first reference. When relevant, mention the specific strain, such as **E. coli O157: H7**(Note: The O is the letter "O" not a zero.) See [scientific names](/home/l/latin-scientific-names) for more details about handling such terms. (See also the CBC.ca feature [E. coli](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Findepth%2Ffacts%2Fecoli.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2KYdtqWDya62en0dW0Re6G) for information about this specific bacteria.)

**e-commerce** (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above)

**ecstasy** (lowercase) Acceptable in first and all references to methylenedioxymethamphetamine

****ecumenical council*

*eczema****

**editor in chief** (no hyphens), as in "editor in chief of CBC News" and "the editor in chief moderated the debate" — akin to chief of staff (no hyphens)

**EDT** (_not_ EDST) See [time](/home/t/time)

**Education Week** (capitalized) See [holidays and other special times](/home/h/holidays)

**educator** (not –er; _prefer_ **teacher**)

**effrontery** (impudence); **affront** (deliberate insult)

**e.g.** (means "for example" but _avoid_ in news stories) See [e.g. and i.e.](/home/e/eg-and-ie)

**eHealth Ontario** (provincial government agency) versus **e-health** (generic term). Although the [e-](/home/e#e-) form is preferred for most generic terms (e-book, e-health, e-trade), eHealth Ontario is a proper noun along the lines of eBay (See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for related guidelines)

**Eid al-Fitr** (see [Ramadan](/home/r#Ramadan))

**Eiffel Tower** (Paris)

**Einstein, Albert** (1879-1955)

**either ... or** (see [nor versus or](/home/n/nor-versus-or))

**Ekati** (OK in headlines) **Ekati diamond mine** refers to the operation in the Northwest Territories; **BHP Billiton's Ekati Diamond Mine** refers to company, and should be spelled out once in full in business stories.

**el and El** (In [Arabic names](/home/a/arabic-names), often lowercase and sometimes followed by a hyphen, as in [Abdel Fattah el-Sisi](/home/e#elSisi). In other languages, the article is usually uppercase without a hyphen, as in El Salvador.)

**El Al Israel Airlines** (**El Al** usually sufficient in all references, e.g. _an El Al passenger jet_)

**\-elect (as a suffix)**
**president-elect** (U.S.) _but_ **prime minister-designate** (Canada) — Both terms remain in lowercase even before names (U.S. president-elect Norm Reynolds). Canadian mayors are chosen directly by voters, so we call an incoming civic leader **mayor-elect**. (See [designate versus elect](/home/p/pm-designate) as well as [titles](/home/t/titles))

**elder** (lowercase generic); but **Elder** (as title before name, or component of proper noun) For instance: _Indigenous **elders** gathered in Winnipeg. The **2019 National Gathering of Elders** included a discussion of climate change. **Elder Duke Redbird** helped design the mural. It was rare to have **an Indigenous elder** on staff at a health-care centre in Toronto back then, she said._

**election day** (lowercase, along the lines of **voting day**, based on entrenched convention) There are numerous election days across the country and around the world, from local to regional (provincial, state, territorial) and national. With few exceptions, they're not held on fixed dates. For this reason, election day is treated as a generic term and kept lowercase. By contrast, unique spots on the calendar, such as Father's Day, Valentine's Day and Halloween, are capitalized. See [holidays and other special times](/home/h/holidays) for details.

[**election** versus **elections**](/home/e/election-or-elections) (e.g., a federal election, U.S. midterm elections) See the detailed [election primer](/home/e/election-primer) for guidelines over everything from organizing political panels and reporting on polls to election day blackouts and election night coverage.

**Elections Canada, Elections B.C.** See [**abbreviations**](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents) for handling geographical components of various proper nouns (e.g., B.C. Hydro but WorkSafeBC).

**electoral college** (lowercase) Several countries have versions of an **electoral college system**, which is why the compound is traditionally treated as a generic term rather than as a capitalized proper noun. The College of Cardinals, by contrast, is a unique global body. When covering closely contested elections that feature electoral colleges, it's common to compare the **electoral college vote** (lowercase) to the **popular vote** (lowercase). Be aware that some U.S. media frequently capitalize electoral college in domestic stories. This is a stylistic preference to distinguish their country's system from foreign electoral colleges.

**electrical** (powered by electricity); **electronic** (connected to a circuit board or similar component for the storage, reproduction, transmission, etc., of electronic data) Avoid mixing up these terms. The former refers to a power source, the latter to a specific type of device — which may also be powered by a direct connection to an electrical source (generally low-voltage). A wide range of household appliances (e.g., refrigerators and stoves), various carpentry tools, stun guns, some cars, etc., are electrical, while TVs, stereos, computers, cellphones, etc., are electronic. This means an [e-bike](/home/e#e-bike) is electrical while an e-reader is electronic. The term electrical is sometimes shortened to **electric**, as in [electric vehicles](#EVs) and electric fencing (also known as "electrified fencing") that carries a current. Security walls may include electric fencing and electronic surveillance.

**Elizabeth Fry Society**

**Elizabeth Tower** (the old Westminster Clock Tower was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 2012) It's OK to refer to the structure as **Big Ben's tower** (possessive, lowercase "t"). See the [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames#caution) overview for a related style note about the clock's hourly bell, [Big Ben](/home/b#BigBen).

ellipsis, ellipses (...) See [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation)

**el-Nashar, Magdy Mahmoud Mustafa** (Egyptian biochemist detained for questioning as part of the investigation into the July 7, 2005, London bombings); **Magdy el-Nashar** (This shorter version is fine in first reference); **el-Nashar** (second reference). Capitalize the E only at the start of sentences (e.g., "El-Nashar used to teach at Leeds University in Britain.")

**El Niño** (include accent) See [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words)

**el-Sisi, Abdel Fattah** (Egyptian leader and former military chief) Declared winner of the country's 2014 presidential elections. For consistency, prefer this spelling, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, over alternative transliterations. Use **el-Sisi** in second reference. Capitalize the E only at the start of sentences. NOTE: While most North American news organizations initially reported the name as "el-Sissi," there was a gradual shift to drop an "s." CBC News adopted the spelling "el-Sisi" in late 2017. See [Arabic names](/home/a/arabic-names) for details and related guidelines.

[**elopee**](/home/e/elopee) (nonsensical jargon; avoid)

**Élysée Palace**, the (official residence of the French president) Note the spelling of Élysée, which can vary depending on the specific construction (e.g., in the name of a street, like the nearby **Champs-Élysées** in Paris).

[**email**](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#email) (no hyphen), **electronic mail**; but use [**e-**](/home/e#e-) for most other comparable formations (**e-book, e-commerce, [e-waste](/home/e#ewaste)**, etc.), based on entrenched usage



**[e-el](/home/e#e) -** **[em-er](/home/e#em) -** **[es-ez](/home/e#es) - [bottom](/home/e#bottom)**

**embedded** (_not_ imb-), an **embedded journalist** (A common and acceptable term to describe journalists and other civilians travelling and living with military forces in a combat zone) See [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview) for related guidelines.

**embryo, embryos**

emcee (_avoid;_ use [**MC**](/home/m#MC) instead when abbreviating "master of ceremonies")

**Emergencies Act** (passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1988) The Emergencies Act **replaced the old 1914 War Measures Act**, which had been attacked by critics as far too sweeping. Be precise with statutory titles. Avoid calling the legislation the "new" War Measures Act, which is inaccurate and misleading. The Emergencies Act gives the federal government special temporary powers to ensure the safety and security of Canadians during national emergencies. But it requires Parliament review cabinet-issued emergency declarations. It also stipulates that any suspension of civil rights be "reasonable and justified" under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A 2001 [Library of Parliament summary of the Emergencies Act](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.gc.ca%2Fcollections%2FCollection-R%2FLoPBdP%2FBP%2Fprb0114-e.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XrBXgOQnumpqGg7lOqQU1) includes pertinent historical context.

**emergency room** (The abbreviation **ER** is fine in headlines and direct quotes)

**emeritus** (retired but permitted to retain one's title as an honour) Although considered a masculine singular form in Latin, emeritus is **not gender specific** in English. Therefore, prefer it over the relatively obscure "emerita" when referring to women. Keep the word lowercase across the board, as in a professor emeritus of physics. (See also [alumnus](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/#alumnus "A"))

****emigrant, emigrate, emigration****

**eminent** (notable); do _not_ confuse with "imminent" (impending)

**Emmy, Emmys** (TV awards)

**emoji, emojis** (pictographs of faces, objects, etc.) Emojis are small, often cartoon-like, drawings (e.g., a face, an animal, a plant, a geometric shape) that represent specific feelings or ideas in emails, tweets, and other electronic text. They're distinct from **emoticons**, which are normally keyboard-based, typographical creations used to convey emotions (e.g., a colon and closing paragraph mark, :), represent a happy face sideways).

****emphysema****

**Empire State Building** (See [buildings](/home/b/building))

**employment insurance** (not unemployment insurance), **EI** in second reference
**
enamour, enamoured** (as a passive verb, enamoured is often followed by "of," in the same way that _inspired_ frequently precedes "by")

**Encana** (Canada's largest natural gas company) Formerly known as Alberta Energy Co. and PanCanadian Energy. Encana dropped its capital C (EnCana) in March 2010.

**encyclopedia**, _but_ **Encyclopaedia Britannica**

****endeavour****

**endemic** (See [endemic, epidemic, pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic))

**endgame** (fused)

**energy sector** (_umbrella term that requires care_) Many countries' energy sources are increasingly diverse. Canada's energy sector, for instance, includes **fossil fuels** (oil, gas, coal), **hydroelectricity, wind** and **solar** power, **nuclear** energy and **wood** (e.g., from burning forestry and sawmill waste). Whenever practical, be precise to avoid inaccurate generalizations (e.g., **do not imply that "Canada's energy sector" is a synonym for Canada's petroleum sector**). **Use common sense**. For example, it's OK to talk about "off-shore energy" as long as the context of petroleum production is clear in the story. No one is going to assume we mean "off-shore atomic energy." And it's fine to use "energy" as a modifier when accurate and the meaning is understood (e.g., an energy project, Alberta's energy policy, a pipeline proposal being reviewed under the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act**). But it's potentially misleading to refer to, say, Alberta's oil and gas companies as "Alberta's energy companies" in a default, formulaic way. Calling them "energy" companies in second reference, by contrast, would be clear and acceptable. Be aware that we get audience complaints when we repeatedly resort to big labels such as "energy sector" to narrowly mean fossil fuels (e.g., "the West's energy industry" also includes hydroelectricity, wind and solar).

**England** (no abbreviation) Do not use to mean [Britain](/home/b/britain)

**English Canada, English Canadian** (no hyphen), but **English-speaking Canadian** (See also [geographical demonyms](/home/r/racial-terms#geographical) for related guidelines on dual heritage, such as African American, Korean Canadian)

**enormity** (wickedness), **enormousness** (size)

enquiry (_use_ **inquiry**)

**enrol** (_not_ enroll), **enrolment**; but **enrolled, enrolling
**
**en route** (always two words)

**ensign** (rank, no abbreviation) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks) (But **the Red Ensign** for the flag)

**ensure** (make sure of) Do _not_ confuse with insure (to cover loss)

**entomological, entomologist, entomology** (insects); **etymology** (words)

**entree** (n.) the main course (especially in North America); the right or privilege to gain entry (Do not bother with an accent or italics, since the original [French](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) term _entrée_ is well-established as an English word.) See also [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics)

****entrepreneur, entrepreneurial****

**Environmental Protection Agency** (_avoid_ EPA) See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines

**e-passport** (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above)

**epidemic** (See [endemic, epidemic, pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic))

**epigram** (witty saying)

**epilepsy, epileptic** (See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#epilepsy))

**EpiPen** (trademarked name) Fine in first and subsequent references. To help readers unfamiliar with this pen-like injector, describe it as a disposable needle that lets people give themselves an emergency dose of a hormone (epinephrine) to treat severe allergic reactions. Note: The term **epinephrine** is also known as [adrenalin](/home/a#adrenalin). (For general guidelines on proprietary capitalization, see [trademarks](/home/t/trade-names))

**epitaph** (words on tombstone)

**epithet** (word or brief phrase used to describe a person, a group, etc.) Such labels are often disparaging and can be highly offensive (e.g., racial epithets, homophobic slurs). Originally, epithets were directly tied to people's name (e.g., Ivan the Terrible). Today, however, the term's meaning is much broader. Epithets sometimes function as adjectives before names, as in "bean counter Bill." Do not confuse with [expletive](/home/e#expletive) below.

**ePub, ePub file** format (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above)

**equator**

**ER** (capital letters, no periods) This abbreviation for emergency room is fine in headlines. But in the main body of a story, we prefer to spell out the term in first reference, unless it's in a direct quote. ER doesn't need to be defined in brackets.

**Erbil** (city in Iraq) For consistency, avoid other [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), including Irbil and Arbil

**e-reader** (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above)

**Ericsson, Leif** (A Viking explorer who sailed west from Greenland and reputedly became the first European to discover North America in about AD 1000. Legends suggest he landed along the shores of what's now Newfoundland and Labrador. He may have also travelled south to the northeastern U.S. In the 1960s, an international team of archaeologists confirmed the existence of a millennium-old Norse community at [L'Anse aux Meadows, N.L.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pc.gc.ca%2Feng%2Flhn-nhs%2Fnl%2Fmeadows%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0-nUp7qHx1Dy8gE8Aollas), and in 1978 the United Nations designated the spot a UNESCO World Heritage Site.)

**errant** (The word originally meant travelling, as in a _knight errant_. It's based on the Latin term for journey, _iter_, as in itinerary.) Over the years, errant has come to mean doing something wrong by deviating from the correct path. Avoid using the word as a synonym for a mere slip. The error should imply straying. (Also, do not confuse with [**arrant**](/home/a#arrant).)

**erratum, errata** (See also [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals))


**[e-el](/home/e#e) -** **[em-er](/home/e#em) -** **[es-ez](/home/e#es) - [bottom](/home/e#bottom)**

**es-ez**
**Eskasoni** (Cape Breton First Nations band)

Eskimo, Eskimos; _but use_ **Inuk, Inuit** See **[Inuit](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk)** for related guidelines, including coverage of the **Edmonton Elks.** There's no reason to use the CFL team's old name in routine coverage of the Elks. In rare cases when a reference to the "Edmonton Eskimos" is deemed relevant and editorially necessary, follow our [guidelines on handling controversial team names](/home/c/controversial-team-names).

**Eskimo Point** (now called **Arviat, Nunavut**)

**ESL** (English as a second language) Use this abbreviation only if its meaning is clearly spelled out in the story.

**esports** (fused; all lowercase)  Commonly refers to competitive, multiplayer video gaming, as in an **esports tournament**. Avoid variations (e.g., e-sports or eSports), unless these are part of a proper noun, such as a company name. Although most generic "e-" coinages retain hyphens to make them easier to scan and comprehend (e.g., e-waste), some, like email, become fused through convention. Several news organizations, including the CBC, dropped the punctuation from esports in 2017. (See **[e-](/home/e#e-)** above for related guidelines)


**espresso** (_not_ expresso)

**esthete, esthetic**

**Eswatini** (formerly Swaziland) The small country in southeast Africa changed its name in 2018. Avoid the quirky rendering "eSwatini." Prefer Eswatini, which matches the spelling used most often at the United Nations. The capital is Mbabane, the kingdom's largest city.

**ET** (eastern time) Avoid specifying EST or EDT. See [time](/home/t/time) for detailed guidelines.

**ET** (common and acceptable generic abbreviation for extraterrestrial; spell out at least once high in story), **E.T.** (Name of extraterrestrial entity in the 1982 movie, _E.T._, as in "_E.T. call home_.") See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for more guidelines and examples.

**ethnic Albanian** (n.) **ethnic-Albanian** (adj.) See [Kosovo](/home/b/balkans#Kosovo)

**e-trade** (see [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above)

**eucharist** (holy communion)

**euphemism** (nice or vague words to avoid harshness); **euphuism** (flowery writing)

**euro, euros** (European Community currency); **Eurodollar** (no hyphen), **eurozone** (lowercase and fused). See also [money](/home/m/money) for detailed guidelines

**European Court of Justice** (See [Court versus court](/home/c/courts))

**European Union (EU); European Parliament** (legislative body of EU). See [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies)

**[euthanasia](/home/e/euthanasia)**

**euthanize** In reference to the death of animals, “euthanize” has varying definitions and is not necessarily a synonym for the administration of a humane death that is as painless as possible. See the notes section of [euthanasia](/home/e/euthanasia).

**EVs** (**electric vehicles**) Does not need to be spelled out as long as the context makes the meaning clear. The modifier "electric" is a colloquial abridgement of "[electrical](#electrical)." Either is fine, although electric tends to be more common in the auto indusry. Avoid jargon unless it's explained or defined. This includes handling descriptions (e.g., prefer "**plug-in hybrids**" over PHEVs). **Hybrid electric vehicles** (**HEVs**) run on both an internal combustion engine and on an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. It's usually unnecessary to try to pack in too much detail about various technology (e.g., "regenerative braking" is a way to charge a battery while driving by storing the kinetic energy used when stopping the vehicle). When reporting specifics, focus on meaningful comparisons (e.g., "Manufacturers say a **Level 3 charger** can get a battery to 80 per cent in less than half an hour, making it much more practical than a **Level 2 charger**, which takes several hours").

****[evacuate](/home/e/evacuate), evacuation, evacuees****

**even money** (n.) odds are even

**even-steven** (adj.) equal or balanced

**everyday** (adj., one word), as in "An everyday lunch" but **every day** (two words, when _every_ is an adj. and _day_ a n.), as in "They go there every day" and "He phones every second day."

**everyone** (everybody, all people referred to), **every one** (each person in a group) "Everyone knows that every one of those predictions turned out to be wrong" and "Everyone in the dormitory knows every one of the suspects." TIP: If you can seamlessly add another modifier before "one," then treat "every one" as separate words, as in: **every single one, every third one.** For instance: Everyone who's studied Dickens knows that Tiny Tim didn't ask God to "bless everyone," but rather said, "God bless us, every one!" — meaning every one \[of us\], every single one, etc. Guard against common redundancies, such as "each and every one." Pick either "each" or "every." The shorter sentence will convey the same information to everyone, every time.

**every time** (always two words)

**e-waste** (discarded electronic equipment, such as computers, TVs, cellphones and stereos) See [**e-**](/home/e#e-) above for similar formations

**ex-**
**ex-prime minister** Brian Mulroney, **ex-premier** Clyde Wells, **ex-president**, etc. (But see [former](/home/f#former) for details on uppercase titles when referring to specific past events.)
Note: The word ex is often a poor choice before a compound noun, such as prime minister, because only one hyphen is used. In a headline, however, _ex-PM_ is fine. Be careful when placing ex in front of adjectives. For instance, is an _ex-Liberal MP_ an MP who has switched parties, or a former MP who was Liberal? If there's any ambiguity, rewrite. See also [then](/home/t#then) (as in then president, which does not require a hyphen) as well as [the late](/home/l#thelate) and [titles](/home/t/titles)

**exaggerate, exaggeration**

**Exhibit A, Exhibit B**, etc. (See [single-letter abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations#singleletters) for more guidelines and examples)

****exhilarate*

*exhort****

**existence** (_not_ -ance)

****exonerate*

*existentialism****

**exorbitant** (_not_ exhorbitant)

**[expatriate, expat](/home/e/expatriate)**

**expedite, expediter** (_not_ -or)

**expel, expelled**

**expletive** (an obscenity) Technically, expletives are words used to fill out sentences without adding anything beyond emphatic or exclamatory tone. But the term has come to mean swearing and other vulgarisms (e.g., "a "f--king bean counter" rather than just "a bean counter"). Do not confuse with [epithet](/home/e#epithet).

Expo 67, Expo 86 (no apostrophe) See [World Fair versus world fair](/home/w/world-fair)

**expose** (verb); **exposé** (noun) See also [French accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents)

### earth

**Earth versus earth**

**Capitalize when referring to it as a planet:**

_Scientists hope the new satellite lets them take better pictures of_ _Earth_ _from space.

The atmosphere on Mars is nothing like Earth’s.

We cut trees. We burn fuel. We see global warming all around us. But can we still save the Earth?_

**But keep lowercase in general expressions:**

_down to earth
heaven on earth
move heaven and earth
what on earth do you mean?_

See also [space terms](/home/s/space-terms)

### earthquakes

**Earthquakes**

**Never use** the term **Richter scale** when reporting the intensity of earthquakes. **Use "magnitude"** instead.

Seismologists abandoned the old systems (Richter, Mercalli and other scales) years ago because these focused on local effects without capturing the overall picture.

Experts now frequently talk about "moment magnitude," which we and other news organizations shorten to "magnitude." This number estimates how much and how far the earth moved at a specific time (the moment of shock).


**Preliminary magnitude**
It's important to keep in mind that even "moment magnitude" is an estimate. It may change as more data comes in or if the interpretation of existing data shifts.

**Always report the initial numbers as "preliminary,"** and attribute the source when possible (e.g., the U.S. Geological Survey).

_"The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.7," "The quake had a magnitude of 6.7 according to preliminary reports,"_ etc.

The word preliminary can be dropped when the experts agree on a figure (usually within a few hours).

**Aftershocks** are smaller quakes that occur hours (and sometimes days) after the initial quake. The term **temblor** (_never_ tremblor) is another word for earthquake, although it's rather esoteric and leaves some editors shaking their heads when it shows up in copy.


**4.7 versus 6.7**
The "moment magnitude" **scale is logarithmic** (an increase of 1.0 is a 10-fold jump in wave amplitude and a 30-fold rise in "energy output"). This means, for instance, that a 5.7 quake releases 30 times more energy than a 4.7 quake, but that a **6.7 quake releases about 900 times more than a 4.7 quake** (30 times 30).

We don't normally feel quakes with a magnitude of less than 1.0. The scale is theoretically open-ended, although scientists think that "rock mechanics" preclude earthquakes larger than roughly 9.5.

**On the web, follow the publishing convention of adding a cipher to the magnitude if the number is even** (7.0) to help make the figure jump out for readers, to confirm that no information has been inadvertently dropped from the story (e.g., 7.1 became 7 because of a writing/editing slip) and to maintain a consistent decimal style in our online journalism. A hyphen is not required in adjectival constructions (e.g., a 7.0 magnitude quake, a 6.8 magnitude quake).


**Minor, medium, major**
Magnitude numbers don't mean much to the average person. It's helpful to **include descriptions (e.g., a minor, medium, or major quake)** based on the damage normally caused by that level of intensity.


**Mild**
**Under 4.0** – Rattling dishes.


**Minor**
**4.0 to 4.9** – Slight damage.


**Medium**
**5.0 to 5.9** – Moderate to heavy damage, depending how structures are built.


**Medium to Major**
**6.0 to 6.9** – Heavy to severe damage, including the possibility of collapsed buildings.


**Major**
**7.0 to 7.9** – A major quake causing widespread and severe damage.

Anything higher than 8 is considered one of the rare "great" quakes. But **in news stories the real figures that matter are the number of people dead, injured and homeless, as well as the time and money required to rebuild.**

The extent of devastation, of course, depends a lot on how close the epicentre is to a densely populated area. **When it hits a city, town or village directly, say the community is "at" (not over) the epicentre.** An epicentre is not underground but is on the Earth's surface. (It's directly above the "hypocentre" or focus of the seismic rupture, jargon we don't use.)


**Historical numbers**
**It's misleading to compare new magnitudes to old numbers** (e.g., Richter scale figures in the record books). The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, for instance, points out that the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was 8.3 on the Richter scale but is now classified as roughly 7.9 on the "moment magnitude scale."

For more information about earthquakes, including detailed guides to all the numbers, consult the [U.S. Geological Survey](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgeology.usgs.gov%2Findex.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3YqNpfMNBshieADnWzXtcJ) website.

**If you're writing or editing a story right now about a recent earthquake** that happened anywhere in the world, you may find more information about it from a [different spot](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fearthquake.usgs.gov%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2sn8WV1xB6B5v-EU1ZiiOi) on the same USGS site. [**Earthquakes Canada**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fearthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca%2Findex-eng.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3NHizYw_sUdVCIr6kzDTf_) is a good source for tracking seismic activity in this country.

### \-ed verus -t

**\-ed versus -t**

**past tense, past participles**
**When there are competing forms of verbs, generally use -ed instead of -t** in past tense and past participle constructions:

**burned** not burnt, as in "The bulb has burned out."
**leaned** not leant, as in "She leaned against the wall."
**learned** not learnt, as in "They've learned a few things."
**smell** not smelt, as in "He smelled smoke."
**spelled** not spelt, as in "She spelled it correctly."
**spilled** not spilt, as in "Fans spilled into the streets."
**spoiled** not spoilt, as in "The surprise was spoiled."

**The main Canadian exceptions are:**

**dreamed** or **dreamt**, as in "They dreamed (_or_ dreamt) of better days."
**kneeled** or **knelt**, as in "She kneeled (_or_ knelt) by the grave."
**leaped** or **leapt**, as in "He leaped (_or_ leapt) to the wrong conclusion."


**adjectives**
**burnt** (preferred), as in "burnt toast" or a "burnt-out bulb"
**learned**, as in a "learned judge"

### e.g. and i.e.

**e.g. and i.e.**

**e.g.
**Latin for "**exempli gratia**," which means "**for example**"

> _He watches a lot of sports (e.g., hockey, baseball, football), but has never seen a cricket game._


**Generally avoid using "e.g." in news stories**, which look cluttered and can be confusing when filled with abbreviations, especially Latin ones.

Although some foreign expressions are common (ad hoc, per cent, per diem, status quo) others are not nearly as well-known or understood. Many usage guides recommend that e.g. and i.e. be reserved for footnotes of scholarly works rather than the main text.

When introducing an example using this abbreviation, **always put a comma after e.g.,** which is treated as a distinct prepositional phrase. This is standard punctuation in most style manuals, according to the Guide to Canadian English Usage. **Italics are unnecessary.**



**i.e.**
Latin for "**id est**," which means "**that is**"

> _She loved Newfoundland and Labrador but was also fond of the Maritimes (i.e., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I.)_


**This abbreviation normally has no place in news writing, but if you do use "i.e." avoid falling into the common trap of confusing it with "e.g."**

The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage cites the following example of misuse by a large Canadian newspaper in 1995:

> (WRONG) _"Carsten lacked those silly misconceptions held by some travellers (i.e., all Canadians live in igloos, all Aussies wrestle alligators in their spare time) …"_


In the above case, "i.e." introduces examples rather than an explanation. It should be "e.g."


When adding explanatory detail, **always put a comma after i.e.,** which is treated as a distinct phrase — along the lines of "that is to say." This is standard punctuation in most style manuals, according to the Guide to Canadian English Usage. **Italics are unnecessary.**



### Election or elections

**Election versus elections**

**Prefer the singular** (election) **when referring to a general election to determine a national, provincial, territorial or local government:**

> She plans to run in the next **federal election**.
>
> The 2008 U.S. **presidential election** has a special place in the history books.
>
> Only two incumbent councillors ran in Calgary's **municipal election**.
>
> They're demanding a **federal byelection** be called.


**Limit use of the plural to entirely separate races held on the same day** (e.g., towns and cities in a province picking their own local governments), **or to a series of different elections over time.**

> Ontario's **municipal elections** will be held this fall.
>
> Saskatchewan, B.C. and Alberta **elections** are scheduled for ...
>
> He ran in four **federal elections** and lost each time.
>
> Three **byelections** will be held in two different provinces on Tuesday.

**Foreign coverage**
**Apply the distinctions above to elections in other countries.** For example:

> **Afghanistan's parliamentary election was ...**
>
> (Why singular? The September 2010 general election was to choose MPs for the Wolesi Jirga, along the lines of Canada's federal election to pick MPs for the House of Commons.)

> **U.S. midterm elections are ...**
>
> (Why plural? Since congressional elections in the U.S. involve Senate and House of Representative races, they're conventionally called midterm elections.)

**Elections Canada**
The proper noun is **Elections Canada**. It's an independent federal agency that oversees national (general) elections, as well as federal byelections and referendums. Elections Canada reports directly to Parliament.

While some people argue that individual ridings actually hold separate, individual elections in any given national parliamentary contest, Elections Canada also uses the term "general election" (singular) to describe the overall ballot race for seats in the Commons.

The [Elections Canada website](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elections.ca%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fsection%3Dele%26lang%3De&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0QiHhK8DHmxxVqSMRSlaxA) offers for a wealth of historical details, including some electoral statistics going back to 1867.

**OVERVIEW**
**Federal, provincial and territorial elections raise unique editorial challenges, including how we:**

-   Report on polls.
-   Tackle panel discussions and "serial interviews."
-   Handle incumbents' titles.
-   Gauge equitable treatment of parties over time.

The principles of **accuracy, transparency, balance and fairness are central.**

**There can also be legal considerations**, including the way we:

-   Co-ordinate political free-time programming.
-   Deal with illegally recorded content, such as a photo taken from inside a polling station and then posted on social media.

This primer answers common questions. There are also links to supplementary reference material with more detailed information about specific points, including [**Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on politics**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fpolitics-1.4523351&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1JzlIMztzK0lZtiRHnpBNa).


**FAQs**
**1\. When does the election period begin?**
Federal, provincial and territorial elections start when the Crown writs are issued, often about a month before the actual election date. Campaigns can, however, be substantially longer (e.g., the 2015 federal election started two months before the scheduled October vote). Even in the case of fixed election dates, writs are required. (See [start of election period](/home/e/election-primer#A).)

**2\. Do we need to log all election-related stories?**
No, not all stories on all platforms, 24/7. But we use an Election Logging System to track representative broadcasts (e.g., election stories aired at certain times or on certain flagship programs). This helps us maintain equitable coverage of parties over time. It's not a substitute for the regular evaluations that editorial units conduct. But it's a good metric to have, especially if we need to respond to criticism from the parties, candidates, special interest groups or others.

**3\. Do we need to give each party equal time in each newscast?**
No. That's not realistic. But we need to track how much time each party is getting, and there must be [balance and fairness over time](/home/e/election-primer#B).

**4\. How do I handle titles like PM and premier?**
Drop parliamentary titles in election stories to avoid even the perception of giving incumbents an advantage (e.g., Premier Jane Smith becomes Conservative Leader Jane Smith). In stories unrelated to the election, however, cabinet references are OK. Use common sense. (See [titles](/home/e/election-primer#C).)

**5\. When organizing panels and "serial interviews," do we need to include all parties?**
No. Any party that we think is likely to have a noticeable influence on the election outcome should be invited to participate in panels (i.e., moderated political discussions) as well as in serial interviews (e.g., a series of one-on-one interviews spread out over the campaign). This generally means mainstream parties with sitting members, but can include other parties expected to win seats or split votes in close ridings. (See [debates, panels and 'serial' interviews](/home/e/election-primer#D) for more guidelines and specific caveats.)

**6\. What do we need to know about political advertising and free-time political programs?**
Newsroom staff are sometimes asked why certain political content is being aired during election campaigns. In order to answer public queries or direct them to the right co-ordinator, it's helpful to have some basic information about [free-time political programs](/home/e/election-primer#F) and [paid political advertising](/home/e/election-primer#G), and to know the difference. On the web, journalists must ensure that political ads do not appear next to election stories by adjusting CBCNews.ca's publishing tool settings as required.

**7\. What are the rules on the way we report polls?**
Methodology must meet CBC standards, and certain information included in stories ― from sample size and margin of error to the identity of the poll sponsor and the firm that conducted the survey. Some of these details are required by law during election campaigns. For instance, in federal elections, it's necessary to report where full survey details can be found (i.e. a third party web address) in the first 24-hour period after a poll's results are released. There are also internal (CBC) editorial guidelines around language used (e.g., polls "suggest" but do not "show"). We avoid poll-driven election coverage by limiting the number of surveys we cover and the prominence these polls are given in newscasts and on web pages. (See [polls](/home/e/election-primer#E) for more details, including tips on questions we should ask ourselves when evaluating surveys commissioned by third parties.)

**8\. What's an election day "blackout"?**
There are actually several types of blackouts, from those dealing with political advertising to results of new opinion surveys. Since the 2015 federal election, however, we've NO longer had to contend with old restrictions about reporting results from one region until polling stations were closed in another. (See [blackouts](/home/e/election-primer#H).)

**9\. What can we report on election day while all polls are still open?**
As pointed out in blackouts, the only content automatically off-limits while all voting stations are open on election day are new opinion surveys. There's no ban against reporting hard news about a particular party or candidate. But we must take extra steps to be extremely even-handed. (See [election day coverage](/home/e/election-primer#I).)

**10\. Does CBC News declare winners on election night?**
No, our election desk projects winners based on analysis of each riding's preliminary returns. (See [election night results](/home/e/election-primer#J) for related style points.)


**DRILLING DOWN**
**(A) Official start of election period**
Federal, provincial and territorial elections can be triggered in several ways (e.g., at the request of a majority government leader, when a minority government loses confidence of the legislative house). In all cases, **writs are required for each riding. They're legal documents signed by the Crown's representative** (the Governor General for federal races and a lieutenant-governor for provincial or territorial ones), and returned after voting ends.

**Writs signal the start of the election period and, so, affect everything from advertising to advance polls. In some jurisdictions fixed election dates are now set** (e.g., in Ontario it's the first Thursday of October every four years, and in Saskatchewan it's the first Monday of November every four years, as long as the confidence of each province's legislature is maintained), with **writs automatically issued according to timelines** (e.g., in Ontario in 2011, the election period was scheduled to begin 29 days before the fixed election date of Oct. 6). **Fixed federal election dates have been in place in Canada since 2007, although, again, the modifier "fixed" can be misleading** because the Canada Elections Act does not preclude other dates (e.g., if a minority government falls because it cannot maintain the confidence of the House of Commons). Assuming an earlier federal election is not triggered, the legislation specifies that balloting be held on the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year following the previous general election.

Election campaigns commonly last just over a month in Canada, although lengths vary. **By law, national election campaigns must last at least 36 days** (about five weeks) **and no longer than 50 days** (about seven weeks), according to federal legislation.


**TIP: There's usually no need to refer to "writs" in stories. If you do use the word, however, a phrase such as "issuing the writs" is generally preferred.** The cliché "dropping the writ" is best avoided for three reasons: It's hackneyed. It's odd imagery (documents are not dropped on purpose). And it's generally inaccurate unless plural because most federal and provincial elections involve more than one riding. The exception is when a single byelection is held.

**(B) Balance and fairness over time**
Although elections raise a number of special editorial challenges, **the broad principles that guide us are rudimentary: Accuracy, fairness, balance, transparency and independence. These are the hallmarks of our coverage.** The first three are so vital, they're underscored in our official election coverage policy:


> "We ensure that the facts and analysis we present on issues, candidates and parties is timely, accurate, fair and balanced over the course of the campaign. We give all candidates, parties and issues equitable treatment. This does not necessarily mean equal broadcast time."

> > > > > > > > > ― CBC Journalistic Standards and Practices


To fully understand the concept of balance and fairness over time, **here are some important takeaways:**

-   **Report every registered party and Independent candidate's platform in some way, however briefly, at least once during the campaign** (e.g., posting their platforms on a special web page and mentioning them in an on-air roundup) This gives our audience with as much information as possible about all options at the ballot box. 
-   **It's OK if front-runners are followed more closely because equitable treatment is viewed through the prism of known voter support.** Put another way, there's no rule that every candidate, no matter how peripheral, must be given the same amount of coverage. There are no "equal-time" requirements in Canada. Indeed, given limited time and journalistic resources, that approach would not serve our audience best. (See [political panels](/home/e/election-primer#panels) for related guidelines.)
-   **Equitable treatment does not necessarily translate into the same amount of air time or web space on a given day.** That is not always possible or desirable. Averaged over several weeks, however, front-runners normally receive about the same percentage of coverage.


-   **When assessing who qualifies as front-runners, we should bear in mind that surveys of voters' intentions are snapshots, subject to margins of error**, and that support can shift.


-   **When classifying parties as "major," know the election you're writing about** (e.g., the Parti Québécois and the Saskatchewan Party have held power provincially). Don't assume that the trio of usual suspects (Conservatives, Liberals, New Democrats) automatically applies to a specific region.


-   **Even in a first-past-the-post voting system, an election can be significantly affected by more than just front-runners** (e.g., a party expected to win few seats nationally may alter the outcome in some key ridings or in a particular province, and a former party member no longer in caucus and now running as an Independent may merit coverage not normally given to candidates outside the party system). In cases like this, **adjusting the spotlight may make editorial sense. Be flexible.** Reassess and redeploy resources as required.


-   **If one candidate or party attacks another, responses should be reported as soon as possible** (preferably in the same day's "news cycle").


-   Although the opportunity for equitable treatment is initially spread out over a month or more, overall time remains finite. So **as election periods draw to an end, keep in mind that the chance to redress any possible imbalances becomes limited** as the remaining time collapses. (See [serial interviews](/home/e/election-primer#serialinterviews) below for a related caution.)
-   **Past programming rerun in whole or in part during election periods can affect perceptions of fairness and balance** (e.g., an old episode of a current affairs or comedy show that focuses on specific parties, candidates or even issues, such as health-care spending).

**(C) Titles (prime minister, premier)**
**After writs are issued, generally identify incumbents running for re-election by party affiliation only. This includes a premier, the prime minister or other cabinet members.** The guiding principles are impartiality and fairness.


> Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said ...
>
> Marc Garneau, the Liberal candidate in the Quebec riding of ...
>
> Ontario Conservative Leader Doug Ford is expected to ...


**Exceptions are stories not directly tied to the election**, when the person is speaking on behalf of the government or the country:


> Prime Minister Trudeau called the bombing a tragedy ...
>
> Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau told the UN ...
>
> Ontario Premier Doug Ford urged Michigan's governor to ...


**This doesn't mean we can't put relevant background or context in election stories** (e.g., "Harper has been prime minister since 2006"). **But we must avoid the perception of giving a particular office holder an advantage.
**
For more details and examples, see the Language Guide entry: [Titles during elections](/home/e/election-titles)


**(D) Debates, panels and 'serial interviews'**
**DEBATES**
**Debates are formal, moderated events** generally involving party leaders. They're normally broadcast live. **Decisions about dates, formats, participants, etc., are usually looked after by an independent body.** Since such debates are often held only once during the election, and since they can result in spontaneous and insightful moments between candidates, it's important to plan coverage beyond predictable party spin. This can include everything from live, blow-by-blow blogging to interviewing a group of undecided voters after the event. Always **use current, precise language about who's behind a given event.** For instance, **avoid describing a national debate being aired on all the major networks as a "CBC debate."** In 2019, for example, the independent Leaders' Debates Commission organized the national debate, which was produced by the Canadian Debate Production Partnership (CDPP) rather than by the old "broadcast consortium" group.

**PANELS**
**Panels are less formal debates.** Some feature analysts, including journalists, contributing nonpartisan insight. But **panels made up of partisan guests**, including candidates, managers, party strategists and the like, **require special care. For balance and fairness in these cases, include representatives from all major parties.** 



**TIP: By limiting panels to no more than three or four people, there's enough time for everyone to have a say.** Groups larger than this tend to become too unwieldy for moderators and to drag on too long for audiences.


**Smaller parties do not need to be included on panels.** We satisfy our own policy and CRTC rules about equitable treatment of candidates as long as we give smaller parties some coverage at some point during the election campaign. (See [balance and fairness over time](/home/e/election-primer#B) above for more details about "equitable treatment.")



**TIP: Someone may challenge your decision about panel participation. So have sensible and consistent criteria in place.** For example: (i) Only parties that held seats before the election was called; (ii) Only parties that received a minimum percentage of the popular vote in the last election; (iii) Only parties running candidates in every riding; etc.


**SERIAL INTERVIEWS**
**Serial interviews are one-on-one Q&As** (e.g., the leaders of all major parties, every candidate in a particular riding). They're **usually broadcast or published on different days.**

To maintain fairness and balance:

-   **Match formats** (e.g., the same interviewer, length, live or taped).
-   **Give interviews equal weight** (i.e., similar time slots and online prominence).
-   **Make sure each "major party" is included in the series.** (See [panels](/home/e/election-primer#panels) above for direction on establishing sensible criteria.)

**Since serial interviews are broadcast on different days, put each one into context for our audience** (e.g., "This is the first in a series of ..."). It's important to point out if we've already talked to specific parties in the series, as well as when we're scheduled to air the next interview.


**TIP: Try to secure firm commitments from all major parties before publishing or broadcasting the first serial interview.** Ideally, this will include exactly when/where the interviews will be conducted. Be aware that some parties may be eager to participate (e.g., if they're trailing in the polls), while others may withhold assurances for strategic reasons. This can give them control over the timing of their interview (e.g., delaying and delaying until the final days of the campaign). It can also allow them to back out at the last minute, since they didn't actually commit in the first place, potentially exposing us to criticism about unbalanced coverage. **If at the end of the day one party does not agree to participate, we should say simply and directly that they were offered the opportunity but declined.** And we still have an obligation to ensure that the party's views are exposed in the course of our overall election coverage.

**(E) Polls**
To serve our audience best, **we prefer to focus on election issues ― those identified by candidates as well as those raised by voters** ― rather than on what surveys suggest are the positions of parties in a horse race on any given day. It's OK to refer to poll standings from time to time in certain stories if the numbers are directly relevant But **poll results should not be the primary focus of most newscasts or daily campaign coverage.** At best, they're an accurate but momentary snapshot. At worst, they're unrepresentative, even when solid, scientific methodology is used (i.e., standard margins of error are never guaranteed 100 per cent of the time, which means some polls can be wildly wrong). It's worth noting that those keen to stay abreast of statistical trends have options. During federal election campaigns, for example, CBC News regularly reports and interprets detailed amalgamations of existing national public opinion surveys in special online features, such as the [Canada Votes Poll Tracker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsinteractives.cbc.ca%2Felections%2Fpoll-tracker%2Fcanada%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1vgKjNrXuuW2Mgi7WI1Tb8) in 2019. Of course, **occasional polls that meet our editorial standards may merit separate coverage if they're deemed newsworthy** (e.g., the percentage of voters who appear to support specific climate change policy), **or if they provide valuable context** (e.g., a better understanding of why parties may be altering tactics or shifting resources midstream). **When commissioning surveys or reporting on other organizations' polls, always follow CBC guidelines.
**
**CBC-COMMISSIONED POLLS**
We're mindful of the potential impact that our surveys might have on public policy debates and elections, especially in the final stretch of a campaign. Therefore:

-   **EIC-level approval is generally required before we commission a survey.**

We assume responsibility for the methodology and quality of CBC-branded polls. So:

-   **Final design must be OK'd by CBC's research department.**

**Be aware that there are specific statutory obligations when reporting on polls during election periods.** In federal election campaigns, for example, it's necessary to report where the full results of a survey can be found (i.e., the web address) in the first 24 hours after results are first released. **Talk to your supervisor if you have any doubts.**

To maximize effective coverage, **be sure to co-ordinate the reporting of CBC polls across platforms.** This may involve giving other units embargoed content
(i.e., compiled/interpreted results) so that various material, such as graphics, can be properly prepared before the story rolls out.

**THIRD-PARTY POLLS**

-   **We do not cover "push" or advocacy polls** (e.g., a survey about teachers' pensions conducted by a union representing teachers).
-   **All polls we report must meet our editorial standards** (random, representative, etc.), with particular attention paid to sample size and margin of error.
-   **Consult CBC's research department when in doubt** about assessing methodology or interpreting results.

**STORY ESSENTIALS**
**When reporting on any poll, always include:**

-   **Who conducted it** (which firm or firms).
-   **Who commissioned it** (the CBC or someone else).
-   **The number of people surveyed.**
-   **How, where and when** (e.g., by phone across Canada Sept. 19-21).
-   **The margin of error** (e.g., 3.1% 19 times out of 20), **unless it's an online survey** — since pollsters don't agree on the scientific validity of calculating margins of error unless a given sample is considered sufficiently random and representative. In those cases, always contact the CBC's research department to see if there are any concerns about a given poll's methodology or overall soundness before reporting the results.
-   **Accurate language** (e.g., polls "suggest" rather than "show," and "percentage" is not the same as "per cent"). **See** [**the Language Guide entry on Polls**](/home/p/polls) for more details.

Depending on the platform, **some poll details may be conveyed in different ways** (e.g., the dates, sample size and margin of error could be placed at the bottom of a graphic in TV, as long as they're on screen long enough for people to read).

**Be aware that there are specific statutory obligations when reporting on polls during election periods.** In federal election campaigns, for example, it's necessary to report where the full results of a survey can be found (i.e., the web address) in the first 24 hours after results are first released. **Talk to your supervisor if you have any doubts.**

**IMPORTANT: On election day, do NOT report the results of new polls** (see [blackout](/home/e/election-primer#H) below). We must also be careful when summarizing past polls (see [election day coverage](/home/e/election-primer#I)) to avoid the perception of influencing voters.

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ABOUT POLLS**

 Before writing about public opinion surveys, **make sure you're familiar with accepted industry standards about conducting polls and interpreting results** ― including caveats about how the margin of error can change drastically when attempting to extrapolate, say, provincial results from certain national surveys because the relevant sample size shrinks disproportionately. The **CBC Research Department's four-page [Poll Reporting Guide Sheet](/media/qe2eeik2/poll-reporting-guide-sheet_cb-a29d4cb8a12f2bc2.pdf)** (PDF) is a good starting point.

 To help news organizations develop a critical eye when assessing whether to report polls, the U.S. National Council on Public Polls has created a document worth reading: [**20 questions a journalist should ask about poll results**](/media/j0djdv3u/20-questions-about-polls_ncpp_3rd-edition.pdf) (PDF). It hammers home the need to understand who asked what questions, when, how, etc.

**IS IT NEWS?**
There's an appetite to know when the horses in a race appear to have moved ahead or fallen behind significantly. But **when deciding whether to report polls, bear in mind that they:**

-   **Aren't always right**, even if they meet editorial standards.
-   **Are snapshots.** The results may already be shifting by the time we report the results of a poll conducted a week earlier.
-   **Can distract from important issues or other election stories** that serve our audience better.

**A good practice is to report overall trends once a week, unless a poll suddenly surfaces that suggests a major story is developing** (e.g. the first signs of the NDP surge and the Bloc Québécois collapse in Quebec during the 2011 federal election). **Even then, approach the numbers with caution** because they could be wrong or a temporary blip.

**UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEYS**
**Be careful when asking the audience for their views about election-related topics**, no matter how weighty or frothy. **Unscientific online or on-air surveys must NOT be characterized as bona fide polls** in any way.

Word requests for participation accordingly, including all question-of-the-day and other POV (point-of-view) audience engagement features. And **when reporting results:**

-   **Be clear that the survey is not intended to represent the opinion of our audience as a whole, or of any other group** (e.g., Canadians, Albertans, university students, retirees).
-   **Give only the actual number of votes cast for each option rather than converting figures into percentages.** This helps distinguish the content from scientific polls.

**(F) Free-Time Political Programming**
**In national elections, federal legislation requires the CBC** and some other radio and television networks **to provide a specified amount of free time to each of the registered political parties.** This lets all parties communicate directly to voters to some degree, regardless of individual budgets. (**In provincial elections, it is CBC policy to also offer free time** to registered parties.) **Noteworthy points:**

-   **Free time is allocated to parties, not to candidates, and is based on a formula** that factors in the number of votes and seats won during the last election.
-   In national elections, **the CBC makes this free time available in short-form "programs" of varying lengths** (e.g., 60-second, 90-second and two-minute spots)**.** Political parties can express their views as they see fit without questions or interruption.
-   **Parties sometimes opt to run advertising spots** in their free-time slots.

**CBC assigns a co-ordinator to look after free-time political programming**, either nationally or provincially. **News staff faced with audience queries, complaints or other comments about this programming should direct people to the co-ordinator.** If unsure, they should ask their supervisor.


**(G) Paid Political Advertising**
**CBC Radio is obliged by the federal Elections Act to accept paid political ads during federal election campaigns** ― even though the network doesn't broadcast commercials at any other time of the year. **Advertising is available to parties only and is highly regulated. CBC hosts introduce each ad with a statement** explaining why the commercial is running, and stressing that all registered parties have the same opportunity to buy time if they so choose.

**CBC Television carries political advertising during federal, provincial and territorial campaigns, although the placement of political ads is restricted.

Political advertising is permitted on certain CBC.ca news pages** (e.g., arts, technology, weather) but not on others (e.g., the main CBCNews.ca page, regional landing pages, the politics section). **Although the system is largely automated based on coding, anyone publishing CBC online journalism must understand when/how manual settings are required to avoid the possibility of political ads appearing next to election-related web stories** (e.g., if an arts story is tied to the election, it should be manually classified as "politics" when posted to the arts lineup). There are also encoding rules about election-related video put on CBC.ca Consult a senior web journalist if you're not sure whether a particular online story should be considered election-related.

**Other essentials:**

-   **Commercial time is separate from free-time political programming** [outlined above](/home/e/election-primer#F).
-   **CBC does not accept ads from "third parties," individual candidates or parties not running candidates.**
-   **If excerpts from paid political spots appear in our journalism** (e.g., in stories about "negative advertising"), **we should give major parties equitable treatment.** This normally means matching the duration of excerpts as closely as practical. It can also include giving parties a chance to comment on the ads shown.

**(H) Blackouts**
**There are different blackouts on election day. Since the term is broad, it's important to be specific** when discussing the rules.

**POLLS:** **It's illegal to broadcast or publish the results of NEW opinion surveys on federal election day ― including non-scientific ones, such as beer or hamburger polls.** This is **a good practice to follow on provincial and territorial election days as well.** Previously reported polls are OK, although there are editorial factors to consider. (See [election day coverage](/home/e/election-primer#I) below.) The blackout on new polls begins at midnight local time on election day.

**FREE-TIME POLITICAL PROGRAMMING:** **The CBC stops all free-time political programming 24 hours before election day.** So if the election is on a Monday, the last free-time political programming must air before 11:59:59 p.m. local time Saturday.

**PAID POLITICAL ADVERTISING:** **Political ads cannot be published or broadcast on federal election day.** This means all party commercials must run before midnight local time. Similar rules apply for most provincial elections. In Ontario, advertising is banned 24 hours before election day.

**JOURNALISM:** **Beyond the blackout on previously unreported polls** cited above, **there are no legislative restrictions on election-related stories while all voting stations are still open. There are, however, editorial considerations** outlined in [election day coverage](/home/e/election-primer#I) below.


**(I) Election day coverage**
The principles of [balance and fairness over time](/home/e/election-primer#B) discussed in detail above take on new meaning on election day because time has virtually run out. **Stories have a greater potential to be unfair because they:**

-   **May have an immediate influence** on voters.
-   **Offer little time for reaction** from parties.

**This means we must be very careful about focusing on a party, candidate or issue.

It does not mean that we are restricted to "photo ops"** of leaders at polling stations **or to fluff pieces** about how the weather and voter turnout. **But we must be extremely even-handed in all reports** ― from hard political news that surfaces election day to background pieces on party platforms or recaps of issues and candidates' performances.

**We must also avoid violating election laws**, such as broadcasting or publishing illegally recorded content, including images or videos taken inside a polling station by a voter with a cellphone.


See also [blackouts](/home/e/election-primer#H) above for related restrictions on reporting public opinion polls, etc.


**(J) Election night results**
In this age of social media, many Canadians post virtually endless updates about what's happening around them on a variety of social media platforms. **Since the 2015 federal election, journalists have no longer had to worry about inconvenient and challenging "results blackouts"** — i.e., about old federal rules against reporting results from one region in another part of the country where polling stations are still open.

Once voting stations close, numbers traditionally dribble in. **Provide context and be precise with language as you report election results. For instance:**

-   **Make it clear what percentage of polls in the riding have been counted** (e.g., only three out of 25, or 12%).
-   **Identify incumbents**, especially if they are unfamiliar names (e.g., backbenchers).
-   **Look for narratives** (e.g., the government appears on its way to being re-elected but with fewer seats, a third of the cabinet ministers look like they will be defeated, early results suggest the province will have its first majority government in more than a decade).

CBC's election desk has the editorial experience and the tools/expertise to forecast probable outcomes, based on a review of historical voting patterns and a statistical analysis of current trends. So **wait for our election desk to "call" the election, regardless of what competitors may be reporting, and ALWAYS use qualifying language as required:**

-   **CBC News initially "projects" minority or majority governments.** Avoid verbs such as "declares."
-   **Candidates projected to win specific seats can be classified as "elected,"** based on convention.
-   **Use "prime minister-designate" and "premier designate"** when there's a change in government election night, **not** PM-elect or premier-elect. (See [\-designate vs. elect](/home/p/pm-designate) for details, including how to handle terms such as **MP-elect**)

**In rare instances when our election desk reverses a decision** (e.g., a candidate previously projected to win loses her "elected" status), **we should report the development as quickly as practical and with complete transparency** ― acknowledging the change and, whenever possible, explaining it (e.g., if unreported polls in one part of a riding wound up returning vastly different results from earlier projections).

### election titles

**Titles during elections**
**When Parliament or a legislature dissolves, the prime minister is still the prime minister and the premier is still the premier. But that doesn't necessarily mean we should call them that.** Inserting government titles into election stories can be seen as giving incumbents an advantage. **Here are some guidelines:
**



[New PM, premier](/home/e/election-titles#newPM) (designate vs. elect)

[Defeated party leader](/home/e/election-titles#defeated) (who plans to resign)

**Leaders**
**Generally refer to government leaders and cabinet ministers by party affiliation** rather than by titles such as prime minister or premier during federal and provincial election campaigns. **The guiding principles are impartiality and fairness.**


**Conservative Leader Stephen Harper** (not Prime Minister Stephen Harper)
**NDP Leader Darrell Dexter** (not Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter)


**Exceptions are stories off the campaign trail**, when the person is speaking on behalf of the government or the country (e.g., "Prime Minister Paul Martin called the bombing a tragedy" and "Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon told the UN that Canada supports the proposal").

**This doesn't mean that titles like prime minister and premier can't sometimes appear in election stories, too. But they should be the exception rather than our default**, and they should serve an editorial purpose, such as providing helpful background or context (e.g., "Harper has been prime minister since 2006").


**NOTE:** **These guidelines kick in the moment that Parliament or regional legislatures** (provincial/territorial) **are officially dissolved, including when fixed election dates are on the books.** But they do NOT normally apply before then. Otherwise, we'd be in the challenging position of subjectively deciding when to stop using titles like prime minister and premier months before a scheduled election date.


When Parliament or a legislature dissolves, there's no longer an Official Opposition. There are simply several leaders of different opposition parties. Identify them by party affiliation:


**NDP Leader Tom Mulcair** (not Official Opposition leader Tom Mulcair)


Again, this doesn't mean we can't mention at some point in election stories that someone was, say, the Official Opposition leader in the House of Commons when the election was called. But the term Official Opposition leader should be reported as background not as a title in these cases.

For capitalization guidelines tied to party names (Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May but party leader Justin Trudeau, party leader Elizabeth May), see [Leader versus leader](/home/l/leader).

**MPs and other incumbents**
Technically, members of federal and provincial legislative bodies continue to hold office during election campaigns. They have reduced staff to help respond to requests from constituents.

(NOTE: For decades, CBC's election style guidelines wrongly claimed that sitting MPs are technically not incumbents after Parliament dissolves. This error was corrected in 2004. But as recently as the 2011 federal election, some of our journalists were still inquiring about the old ban.)

**While the generic term incumbent is perfectly accurate, prefer language that identifies all candidates as competitors first.
**

The **Conservative candidate** for Central Nova ...
The riding's **NDP candidate** said ...


This doesn't mean we avoid wording that supplies valuable context. Depending on the story, describing someone as a constituency's sitting MP once in second reference might be important to clarify who is running for re-election, especially if the incumbent is not widely known to a national audience. But repeatedly describing someone as a sitting MP can be unfair to others vying for the job, wrongly conveying an atmosphere of entitlement.

**If incumbents win, avoid using the word "elect" in compound titles** (e.g., MP-elect, MPP-elect, MLA-elect, MNA-elect, mayor-elect). Although these candidates are directly chosen by voters (unlike premiers and prime ministers, who are picked by individual political parties), **the term "-elect" should be reserved for new political office holders picked by constituents but not sworn in yet. Furthermore, we generally drop the qualifier "elect" for virtually all declared winners within days of the election,** normally around the time cabinet members take their public oaths of office. See [MP-elect](/home/p/pm-designate#mayor) for details.

During election campaigns, Parliament still has MPs, provincial legislatures still have MPPs, MLAs (or whatever other term applies in a given region), municipalities still have mayors. These people continue to be paid. If they win on election night, therefore, they're simply "re-elected." It's neither necessary nor accurate to refer to incumbents as an "MP-elect" or an "MPP-elect" or a "mayor-elect."

See also [New PM, premier (designate vs. elect)](/home/e/election-titles#newPM) below for related caveat

**Governments**
**When referring to governments during federal and provincial election campaigns, emphasize party ties rather than people's names.** The same principles of impartiality and fairness cited above apply.


Federal government, **Conservative government**, etc. (not Harper government)
Provincial government, **Liberal government** in Quebec, etc. (not Charest government)

**
New PM, premier (designate vs. elect)**
**Never use the terms prime minister-elect or premier-elect.** They are wrong. In our electoral system, we vote for candidates running in local ridings rather than directly for provincial or national figures. Parties, in turn, form governments. And those parties pick (designate) their leaders.

If there's a change in government, the terms **prime minister-designate** and **premier-designate** are OK. More conversational options include **incoming prime minister** or premier, the **next PM** or premier, etc.

See [\-designate versus -elect](/home/p/pm-designate) for more details and examples, including the language used for newly elected presidents and mayors and newly appointed governors general.

**Re-elected PM, premier, etc.**
**If the person who was PM in the previous Parliament wins the election and forms the next government, we simply continue to call the person prime minister.** The same convention applies to premiers. **This is true even in rare cases when political party leaders win majority governments but lose their own seats.** Heads of political parties can govern from outside a given legislative body until they formally become members of the chamber, either by ballot or by acclamation after a byelection is called.

It's an acceptable convention to describe incumbent PMs and premiers as "re-elected" even though their ballot wins are technically as individual members of a Parliament or a legislature rather than as the head of a government.

**Defeated party leader** (who plans to resign)
**If someone loses an election and announces plans to step down as a party leader, we continue to refer to that person as the party leader** (e.g., Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion or outgoing Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion) **until either an interim leader or a permanent replacement is chosen**, depending on the succession path followed.

### elopee

**Elope, eloper, but not 'elopee'**

Centuries ago, the now-archaic legal term "eloper" described someone who fled a spouse with a lover. Today, the word **elope** simply means to **run away to get married**. A person who elopes is an **eloper**, not an elopee.

In recent years, **some police forces have started using "elopee" to mean anything from "escapee" to "missing person."** To our audience, however, **it's is just confusing jargon. Avoid elopee.**
**Instead of labelling people, report known details.** For instance, **if someone has walked away from a halfway house or a detention facility, say so and attribute allegations to the police** — assuming we've decided the story is worth covering. If someone at large is considered a danger to themselves or to the public, report why.

Police sometimes prefer to be vague, of course. But we need to press them for specifics rather than reiterating terms like "elopee."

There can be various JSP concerns in stories like this. So before identifying anyone, take into account all relevant CBC journalistic standards and practices. This often means weighing the public merits of naming people against individual privacy concerns. When in doubt, contact your supervisor.

### endemic, epidemic, pandemic

**Endemic, epidemic, pandemic**

**Endemic**
**Native to or common within a given place.** While this often refers to plants, animals, etc., the word is also applied to diseases. An endemic illness is one that is generally always present in a particular community because of permanent local factors, such as water, air or soil conditions.


**Epidemic**
**A widespread illness** (e.g., influenza, measles, smallpox, scarlet fever) **within a given community at a particular time.** Community can be defined here in different ways, such as a municipality, an area within a province, etc.

**Note: An epidemic does not necessarily mean people become gravely ill or that a lot of people die.** It simply means that a certain illness has infected a large percentage of a given community. Avoid alarming our audience with a term such as "epidemic" without putting a particular outbreak into context with specific information about the number of people known to be infected, recovery time, fatality rates, etc.


**Pandemic**
**An illness that has spread to a significant percentage of the world's population.** The word is also sometimes applied to an outbreak that has swept across an entire country, with the _mere potential to spread globally_. According to **the World Health Organization (WHO)**, for instance: A "flu pandemic" is a worldwide epidemic of a new influenza virus to which people have little or no immunity, and which has _started_ to spread across borders.

**Unless the [WHO](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/u/united-nations/#WHO "United Nations") has officially declared a pandemic, our normal practice is to avoid using the label** when covering outbreaks. We're also cautious about describing a contagion as a "potential pandemic" without attribution. **And we normally wait for WHO officials to declare the end of a pandemic before using such language in stories** (e.g., reporting on "post-pandemic" developments). **Pandemics are usually considered over when global health authorities deem outbreaks under control.** Actual **eradication is not a requirement.** Modern seasonal flu waves, for instance, are believed to have direct ties to past influenza pandemics, as new variants continue to surface and spread in parts of the world every year.

**As with epidemics, pandemics do not have to be severe. But they can be.** A 1968-69 flu pandemic that began in Hong Kong, for example, killed about one million people. By contrast, **the infamous 1918 flu pandemic is estimated to have killed as many as 50 million.** While the latter is sometimes dubbed the "Spanish flu," it's worth noting that scientists are uncertain where the deadly H1N1 influenza first emerged near the end of the First World War. Many historians now believe Spain was inaccurately and unfairly singled out as the source of the 1918 flu solely because of how war censors limited reporting of deaths elsewhere in Europe at the time.

### euthanasia

**Euthanasia**

**Euthanasia is commonly defined as "humanely ending life to relieve suffering."** The adverb "humanely" implies that the act is relatively quick and painless — reflected in the original ancient Greek term _euthanatos_, which meant "easy death."

Although the word euthanasia is OK when the facts fit, **generally prefer expressions such as assisted dying, medical assistance in dying and medically assisted dying in stories about terminally ill patients who want help to end their lives**. (See **[assisted dying](/home/a/assisted_dying)** for core guidelines)

Be aware that **euthanasia sometimes conveys the connotative meaning of non-voluntary death** — i.e., a mercy killing decided by guardians — **partly because of its widespread use in veterinarian medicine** (e.g., to euthanize a pet). **This can be confusing and misleading**, especially if a country's applicable laws restrict medical steps that can be taken when someone is in a coma, has severe brain damage or is unable to provide informed consent.

**Certain forms of medical assistance in dying were once called "voluntary euthanasia"** in public policy debates in Canada. Voluntary euthanasia was defined as direct, "active" aid to help someone die (e.g., administering a drug rather than simply prescribing it). By contrast, "assisted suicide" was defined as relatively "passive" aid, with the final step carried out by the patient. **Today, however, "assisted suicide" is frequently called "assisted dying," and old distinctions between euthanasia and assisted suicide have become largely blurred.** (See [historical perspective](/home/e/euthanasia#historical) below for details.) When reporting on assisted dying in other countries, keep in mind that the local laws and common vernacular may be different. To avoid ambiguity or confusion, it's a good idea to define any known differences in terminology.


**NOTE:**

-   **Report clearly and without jargon.** In particular, **avoid debatable language such as "active" and "passive" euthanasia without direct attribution**. And steer clear of bureaucratic-sounding or illogical constructions (e.g., "euthanasia-related death," which is like saying a "killing-related death").
-   **The term euthanasia is a poor choice if vital medical aid or treatment is stopped** (e.g., a ventilator is turned off at the family's request). **Instead, use phrases like "withdrew life-support."** which describes what happened without plunging us into the debate among medical ethicists over whether a specific act actually constituted euthanasia. (Was the patient suffering? Was the death "painless" or traumatic?) Such wording also acknowledges that **withdrawal of life-support, itself, may not lead to immediate death.**
-   **Generally avoid euphemisms** in stories about people dying ("passed away" or "slipped away").
-   Be aware of the various meanings of words that describe the death of **animals**. Note, for example, that **there are [varying definitions of the word “euthanize”](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2024/2024-10-04-use-euthanize-with-caution-when-describing-animal-death/ "2024 10 04 - Use “euthanize” with caution when describing animal death")** – some people consider it only to refer to the killing of animals that are ill, injured or otherwise unable to thrive, while others give a much broader definition. So, **outside of direct attribution, “euthanize” should be used with caution and not necessarily as a direct synonym for “killed humanely” or “killed as painlessly as possible.”** The verb “kill” is a neutral term to describe when humans end the lives of animals. But there are others. For example, when describing the humane deaths of animals, especially in a veterinary setting, "put down" is acceptable because it's entrenched. The term "destroy" is another option — especially if several animals are killed. The word "slaughter" is normally reserved for mass killings (e.g., dozens of cattle, hundreds of chickens). [Cull](/home/c#cull), by contrast, describes the selection of a smaller number of animals (e.g., a few cattle to reduce a herd's overall size). Hunters might tell you that they harvest animals. So, whatever phraseology you use, be sure to choose wording that gives audiences an accurate and balanced understanding of the situation.

**Historical perspective**

**Before 2016, "assisted suicide" was illegal in Canada**. In addition, **a distinction was made between "euthanasia" and "assisted suicide," now commonly known as "assisted dying."**

This **previously narrow definition of euthanasia described ACTIVE measures taken by medical personnel** to end someone else's life, at the person's request, often because the individual couldn't actually do it on their own for physical, emotional or other reasons. Examples included helping someone swallow pills, turn on a car, start a lethal intravenous drip, activate a carbon monoxide injector. **By contrast, assisted suicide was commonly defined as comparatively PASSIVE** (e.g., prescribing drugs, carrying someone to a car and closing the garage door, setting up a "suicide machine" that emitted a carbon monoxide injection). **Until "medical assistance in dying" was enshrined as lawful under specific circumstances in Canada, it had been crucial to distinguish between "euthanasia" and "assisted suicide."** This included coverage of Quebec's Bill 52 (end-of-life care legislation) in 2013, as well as the federal government's Bill C-14 (medical assistance in dying legislation) in 2016, which led to Criminal Code revisions. **Since 2016, assisted dying and related expressions** (e.g., medical assistance in dying, medically assisted death) **have become the preferred umbrella terms.**

For details, see the Library of Parliament's 2015 paper on [Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide in Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flop.parl.ca%2Fsites%2FPublicWebsite%2Fdefault%2Fen_CA%2FResearchPublications%2F2015139E&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1DHIG9wQLyHJXxMB8UfMAp) as well as its [2016 historical review](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flop.parl.ca%2Fsites%2FPublicWebsite%2Fdefault%2Fen_CA%2FResearchPublications%2FLegislativeSummaries%2F421C14E&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2wz7oQOrXewETYyBopOCN5) of medical assistance in dying legislation in Canada. Health Canada has also posted an [overview of medical assistance in dying in Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fhealth-canada%2Fservices%2Fmedical-assistance-dying.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1WVLFnoZGWW64TK7hqZH_U) that outlines the options available as well as the eligibility criteria.

**Some countries continue to distinguish between euthanasia, assisted suicide, etc.** Therefore, **use care when reporting on cases of medical assistance in dying abroad**. In particular, it's a good idea to **define terms that may have a different meaning in another country.** See the Library of Parliament's comparison of [euthanasia and assisted suicide outside Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flop.parl.ca%2Fsites%2FPublicWebsite%2Fdefault%2Fen_CA%2FResearchPublications%2F2015116E%23app1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3Ok4qPYQpvTK9SXarYIkTL) for details.

### evacuate

**Evacuate**

**Evacuate originally meant "to empty,"** as in to create a void or vacuum. **For many years, therefore, language sticklers argued that while places are commonly evacuated, people are usually not** (unless one administers an enema).

**CBC News style reflected this distinction for decades.** Journalists were told it's OK to write that police _evacuated a house, an office tower, a neighbourhood_, and so forth, but that they shouldn't write "_1,500 people were evacuated" UNLESS the verb was followed by a preposition such as "from" or "to" (e.g., "1500 people were evacuated from the village")._

**English evolves, however**, and **evacuate has the additional, perfectly acceptable meaning of "being urgently and temporarily relocated."** Indeed, it's worth noting that **the primary definition of the transitive verb "evacuate" in the 2004 Canadian Oxford Dictionary is:**

"_Remove (people) from a place of danger to stay elsewhere for the duration of the danger_."

So there's no need to recast clear, conversational and widely used phrases such as "**residents were evacuated**" because of outworn concerns by literalists over whether certain movements involve the bowel.


Those forced from an area because of flooding, a fire, an explosion, etc., are known as **evacuees**. The process itself is called **_evacuation_**.

### ever

**Ever, first-ever, rarely (if) ever**

[first-ever (adj.)](/home/e/ever#first-ever) Generally avoid; virtually always redundant

**Ever (adv.)**

**Ever is an adverb that commonly means "always" or "at any time."** For example:


> They lived happily ever after.
>
> She's ever optimistic.
>
> Nothing ever happens.
>
> Did you ever see the like?


**Ever is also traditionally used to add emphasis** in a variety of ways:


> When will those two ever stop talking?
>
> Did he ever feel like a fool.
>
> Thanks ever so much.


**Idiomatic intensifier**

Some purists recommend dropping "ever" in cases when the same point can be made more directly. For example:


> Have you ever been to Tuktoyaktuk?
>
> Have you been to Tuktoyaktuk?


But **there's no blanket rule against adding the adverb as an intensifier.**

It's worth noting that **the above interrogatives about Tuktoyaktuk are not, technically, identical.** The first sentence uses "ever" to introduce the detail of "at any time." **The second sentence still suggests the sense of "at any time," but by leaving out the adverb it doesn't stress this meaning in the same way. Either is OK, depending on the writer's preference.** Needless to say, replacing "ever" with a different adverb (e.g., "recently") would change the question: "Have you recently been to Tuktoyaktuk?"

**First-ever (adj.)**

The compound **"first-ever" is frequently a mindless redundancy** (i.e., habitually used without thought or purpose).


> He was the first-ever human to walk on the moon.
>
> He was the first human to walk on the moon.
>
> She was the first-ever Indigenous woman to hold the post.
>
> She was the first Indigenous woman to hold the post.


**For this reason, many good writers and editors axe the intensifier "ever" and let "first" do its job alone.** Some defenders of "first-ever" liken it it "first-time" (e.g., "They're first-time home buyers"). The primary difference, however, is that "first-time" cannot  be shortened to "first" and maintain syntactical sense. Other **defenders of "first-ever" believe "ever" helps highlight a given milestone by giving "first" additional punch. The counterargument, however, is that redundancy usually weakens writing** by making sentences unnecessarily flabby.

**The only time "first-ever" is recommended is when clarity demands it.** In headline writing, for instance, adding "ever" to "first" sometimes eliminates ambiguity:


> Canada imposes first-ever trade sanctions against New Zealand
>
> Canada imposes first trade sanctions against New Zealand


In this case, "first-ever" labels the trade sanctions as historic while "first" alone might be interpreted as just an ordinal marker (i.e., Canada is imposing the first of a series of planned trade sanctions).

**Rarely (if) ever, seldom (if) ever**

The common expressions **"rarely ever" and "seldom ever" are occasionally challenged as either redundant or nonsensical:**


> He rarely if ever goes out nowadays.
>
> He rarely ever goes out nowadays.
>
> He rarely goes out nowadays.
>
> They seldom if ever say hello.
>
> They seldom ever say hello.
>
> They seldom say hello.


**But "rarely ever" and "seldom ever" are entrenched idioms that are perfectly acceptable in conversational writing.** The 2007 Oxford Guide to Canadian English points out that "rarely ever" has been in use for more than 300 years, and that "seldom ever" is a "respectable idiom with a long history in English." In formal writing, "if" tends to be added (i.e., "rarely if ever" and "seldom if ever") to make the constructions more logical. Since the missing preposition is already implied, however, **adding "if" to either familiar abridgment is purely optional.**


See [grammar](/handy-links/grammar)

### expatriate

**Expatriate, expat**

Common and acceptable terms for citizens **living abroad, especially for extended periods of time.**

Residency status varies. **Expatriates sometimes have dual citizenship.** In certain cases, they may be perceived to have a strong association with their country of origin even though they're no longer citizens (e.g., in the case of certain celebrities).

Be aware that **we occasionally receive unfounded audience complaints claiming that the label "expatriate" is racist.** It's a myth, however, that the word has been mainly used to describe white people living abroad. **There are countless examples of people with different racial backgrounds using the words "expat" and "expatriate" to describe themselves.** Books, films and other art forms are full of such references. For instance, famed novelist Salman Rushdie — born in India, educated in England and now living in the U.S. — has written extensively about the "expat experience." There are also several websites devoted to expatriates of diverse racial backgrounds, such as "TheBlackExpat.com" and "AsiaExpatGuides."

Examples of common and acceptable usage:


> **Expat Michael J. Fox** succinctly describes a Canadian-born white actor who became famous working on TV and in films in the U.S.
> **Expat Tina Turner** succinctly describes a U.S.-born Black singer who moved to Switzerland.


The transitive verb "expatriate," coined in the 1800s, originally referred to citizens who had been banished as a form of punishment. However, the current meaning of the noun and modifier (living abroad) has been deeply entrenched for more than half a century and is now part of everyday writing and speech:


> CITIZEN (Having the legal status of citizenship in a given country).



> DUAL CITIZEN (Having citizenship in more than one country).

>
> EMIGRANT (Having moved away from a place).

>
> **EXPATRIATE** (Living in another country, usually for an extended period).

>
> IMMIGRANT (Having moved to a place).

>
> MIGRANT (Being on the move or staying in one place for a limited time, often with no prospect of becoming a permanent citizen, such as a migrant worker).

>
> PERMANENT RESIDENT (Having various specific legal rights within a country without being a citizen).

The word "degrees" is not necessary because it's represented by the blank spot before the F (akin to an invisible ˚ sign). For a minus sign, use an "en dash" instead of a hyphen, with no space before the figure (**–10 F**).

**Farsi** (prefer over "Parsi") The modern **Persian** language. Although it's often called Iranian, Farsi is spoken in several countries outside of Iran, including Afghanistan. In news stories about Iran and Iranians, it's an acceptable convention to call the language Farsi or Persian. The word Iranian is also OK but more colloquial, along the lines of referring to U.S. citizens speaking "American."

**farther** (prefer when describing literal or physical distance, as in: _They travelled farther upstream and He slid farther down the slope_); Compare with [further](/home/f#further) (which generally means "additional").

**fatwa** ([italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics#foreignterms) not needed) A specific type of ruling issued by an Islamic authority. In news stories, it's helpful to define this term for readers. The most common description is "a religious edict." But do not describe the decree as "binding" unless the context is clear. Fatwas apply only to those Muslims who already follow the direction of the person issuing them. Since [Islam](/home/i/islam) does not have a single leadership worldwide, contradictory fatwas can be issued by different clerical authorities.

**fete** (n.) festival or large party; **fete** (v.) to honour or lavishly entertain someone in a special way. Do not add an accent, because fete has become a common English word. The French expression _**en fête**_ (to hold or prepare to hold a celebration), however, has an accent and should appear in italics when used in the text of stories. When deciding whether to include a French accent in words, the Canadian Oxford Dictionary is a good guide. (See also [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics))

**Fête nationale** (Quebec holiday on June 24, also called St-Jean-Baptiste Day) This is a French label that is not part of everyday English, so the original accent and capitalization should be followed. You do not need to use the holiday's full, formal name **(Fête nationale du Québec)**, and you do not need to put the proper noun in italics.

Define as "soccer's world governing body" as high as possible in stories, unless it's simply included as part of an event's name (e.g., the **FIFA Women's World Cup**).

**FireSmart** Registered as a trademark in Canada**,** FireSmart should only be used when referring specifically to elements of the proprietary FireSmart programs and not as a generic descriptor or verb (for more general references consider alternative wording such as “taking steps to reduce the risk of wildfire” or specifics such as “clearing brush, cutting trees and removing dry vegetation”).

**first-come, first-served** (_not_ "first-serve") Entrenched shorthand for "first to come, first to be served" since the mid-1500s. Include a hyphen whether used as a noun or as a modifier (on a **first-come, first-served basis**).

**first lady** (U.S. president's wife) _Generally avoid except in the most informal contexts_. The term "first lady" is unofficial. The position is unelected, unpaid and carries no official duties. The same is true of governors' wives (also known as "first ladies" in the U.S.), as well as the spouses of U.S. vice-presidents (sometimes called "second ladies"). While there's no outright ban against using "first lady" in our journalism, the spouse of a male U.S. president is normally so well known, her name alone is generally sufficient in stories (e.g., "Michelle Obama plans to ...") When context is required, there are options beyond adopting an unofficial title (e.g., "the president's wife, Laura Bush"). Never apply the Americanism "first lady" to the wife of Canada's prime minister. Instead, lean toward treating the spouses of government leaders equally by using names alone (e.g., "Michelle Obama and Laureen Harper have both spoken out against the ...).

Foothills to avoid confusion)

**forbear** (a verb for "refrain from"), **forbore** (past tense), **forborne** (past participle), **forbearance** (n., for "patient restraint" or "tolerance"); Do not confuse the verb _forbear_ with the noun **forebear** (which means "ancestor") Note: Forebear is usually in the plural (forebears), is sometimes mistyped as "forbearers," and is periodically misunderstood to mean descendants. All in all, it's best to forbear the use of forebears.

**420** (fused; no colon, hyphen or slash) Slang for [marijuana](/home/m#marijuana), as in a **420 rally** and a **420 march**. Closely linked to annual celebrations now held in many communities on April 20, which is why some people write it as a date ("4/20"). But the term was originally coined in the 1970s to mean a time to meet after school, which is why some people punctuate it as a clock reading ("4:20"). Muddying the waters further, legislation about marijuana has included the same number, such as Bill 420 in California in 2003. For consistency, use 420 without punctuation except in compound modifiers such as **420-friendly**, along the lines of eco-friendly, pet-friendly and family-friendly.

**freebie** (free trip or other benefit)

**freelance** (n., v. and adj.); **freelancer** (n.)

**Freemen-on-the-Land** (n. and adj.); **Freemen** is OK in headlines and second reference, as in the Freemen movement, a dispute with Freemen. **Freeman** and **Freeman-on-the-Land** are the singular forms, as in: "Police arrested the Freeman after a 10-hour standoff." While it's OK to describe Freemen as self-proclaimed sovereign citizens, it's also important to provide context. For example, they don't recognize the authority of national, provincial or municipal laws or regulations — from rules about firearms, auto insurance and drivers' licences to Criminal Code charges and court-ordered eviction notices. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) considers Freemen "extremists."

**fulfil** (not fulfill), ****fulfilled, fulfilment*

*full time, a full-time job, working full time****

**fulsome** (potentially confusing and, so, best avoided in many cases) Conventionally means too much or too flattering. So "**fulsome praise**" is often intended/interpreted as an insult. A complicating factor, however, is that the word fulsome has also come to mean "abundant, full, or generous" over the centuries. Since these senses are contradictory, the 2007 Oxford Guide to English Usage recommends picking a different word to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

### fake\_news

**Fake news**

**Do not use the term fake news as a catch-all label** for inaccurate, exaggerated, unverified or otherwise flawed journalism. It conventionally **refers to deliberately produced fiction masked as news**, especially in digital arenas (e.g., on the web, on social media accounts). While the term often implies an intentional attempt to deceive (e.g., political propaganda), it can also be rooted in gullibility as people naively circulate jokes, hoaxes, etc., they simply assume are true.

Quotation marks or the modifier [so-called](/home/s/so-called) can be helpful but are optional (e.g., what the U.S. president refers to as "fake news").

It's OK to flag specific content as false when fact-checking supports that conclusion. But **when there's genuine disagreement over interpretation of details, it's generally clearer to classify such stories as "disputed,"** and briefly outline each side's views.

Bear in mind that the [CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices (JSP)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fjournalistic-standards-and-practices-jsp-normes-et-pratiques-journalistiques-npj-1.4517476&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0h3ExU9LO6RqgUI90XlcTe) lists accuracy as a core principle, and lays out certain verification guidelines. The JSP also requires balance and fairness, but this does not automatically mean giving equal weight to all opinions, or to dutifully reporting all opinions in coverage of a given story, especially when verifiable facts disprove the claims.

### Father, Mother, Brother, Sister

**Father, Mother, Sister, Brother**

**These terms are common and acceptable** ways to identify a person's particular position in a church or religious order. Generally **use only before full names** (first and last). Keep the audience in mind and **supply additional, relevant information as required** (e.g., which order or nuns someone belongs to or which pastor a priest has been assigned to).


**Father**
(Often used when referring to a Catholic priest)

> **Father Albert Lacombe**


Second reference: **Lacombe** or **the priest**. Although parishioners commonly address priests without using surnames in both first and second reference (e.g., "Father Albert"), this familial approach is not our style.

Bear in mind that titles vary depending on the church within a given faith. For instance, several religions have ordained clergy called [priests](/home/p#priest), but not all of them refer to priests as fathers. By contrast, the title [**Rev.**](/home/r#Rev) normally applies across the board. See also [Monsignor](/home/m#monsignor).


**Mother**
(Often used when referring to the head of an order of nuns or similar religious group)

> **Mother Marguerite-Thérèse Lemoine Despins** 

Second reference: **Despins**.


**Sister**
(Often used when referring to nuns, although not all members of a sisterhood are nuns)

> **Sister Antoinette Castonguay**


Second reference: **Castonguay**.


**Brother**
(Often used when referring to monks or other monastery members)

> **Brother Victor-Antoine d’Avila-Latourrette**


Second reference: **D’Avila-Latourrette**

**
Canonization**
When people have been canonized after death, use whatever new title applies (e.g., Mother Marguerite Bourgeoys became **St. Marguerite Bourgeoys** in 1982, and Brother André Bessette became St. André Bessette in 2010, although he's still commonly called **St. Brother André Bessette** in Quebec).

**In cases of well-known figures, first names are often sufficient:**

> Mother Teresa
>
> St. Paul
>
> St. André

### femalemale

**Woman versus female, man versus male**

Generally avoid using the words “woman” and “man” as adjectives, unless the expressions are common and apply to both sexes.

For instance, **womenswear** (not women’s wear) and **menswear** (not men’s wear) are well entrenched.

_But when it’s necessary to specify the sex or gender of a person_, prefer constructions such as “**female lawyer**” (not woman lawyer) and “**male nurse**” (not man nurse).

**Never highlight the sex or gender of a person unless it’s relevant to the story.**

If a surgeon saves a life or a police officer shoots a dangerous fugitive, for instance, there’s no need to write “female surgeon” or “female officer.” And if a nurse is put into quarantine during a SARS outbreak, there’s no need to write “male nurse.”

**The test should always be, would the other sex be treated the same way** (i.e., would we write “male surgeon,” “male officer,” or “female nurse”?) **Names and pronouns are usually sufficient identification.**

See also [**gender versus sex**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") for related guidelines.

### fewer versus less

**Fewer versus less**

**Fewer**
**Fewer means a smaller number. Use it to refer to countable amounts, as long as the individual units are not thought of a collective whole** (e.g., _less than two months_).

The word is usually paired with plural nouns:

> _fewer buildings_
>
> _fewer teachers_
>
> _fewer cars_
>
> _fewer mistakes_

**Less**

**Less means a smaller amount. Use less to refer to collective quantity.**

The word is normally paired with singular nouns:

> _less salt_
>
> _less wheat_
>
> _less money_
>
> _less animosity_


**Wrong:**

"Less than 2,000 fans turned up."

**Correct:**
"Fewer than 2,000 fans turned up, so less beer was sold."


**Time, money, distance, etc.**
**The term less is also tied to a few plural nouns (_dollars_) when these are commonly identified with a single amount instead of individual units:**

> _Less than two cups of sugar._
>
> _Less than three weeks away._
>
> _Less than 40 kilometres downstream._
>
> _Less than 50 per cent of students are eligible._
>
> _Less than a million dollars._

Flipping these constructions around in your head often helps highlight the singular nature of the amounts in question: 

> _Two cups of sugar is a lot._
>
> _Three weeks is not a long time._
>
> _Forty kilometres is pretty far._
>
> _Fifty per cent is too low._
>
> _A million dollars is missing._

**Picking a preference**

Depending on the wording you want, you often have the option of using either "less than" or "fewer than." For instance:

> _Less meat might_ become _fewer hotdogs
> _
>
> _Less trouble might_ become _fewer problems
> _
>
> _Less scotch might_ become _fewer glasses of scotch_

When in doubt, contact your supervisor. For relevant legal guidelines about how our competitors can use audio and video, consult the recently distributed "news access rules" document from the CBC Law Department.


**Name of tournament**
Full name: **2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa**
Minimum first reference in all journalism: **FIFA World Cup** or **2010 FIFA World Cup**
Acceptable second reference: **World Cup** (or 2010 World Cup)
If a gender-specific modifier is included, capitalize (**Men's World Cup**).^

^ = _If gender detail is deemed necessary, we capitalize for consistency in our coverage  (e.g., Men's World Cup and Women's World Cup), even though technically only the latter (Women's) is included in official FIFA tournament names._

**When writing or editing text** (including on-air scripts and online stories), **always retain the acronym FIFA in first reference** (FIFA World Cup). It doesn't merely strengthen the CBC's coverage as an official broadcaster, **it helps identify the story** (several sports have world cups), **which serves our audience**. And in the case of web journalism, **it also makes content easier to find through keyword searches** when FIFA is in the headlines.

**The acronym FIFA is relatively well known and, so, does not need to be spelled out** as Fédération Internationale de Football Association. When writing about the federation for a general audience, it's helpful to add an explanatory line (e.g., "soccer's world governing body") as high as possible in stories. But this does not normally apply to World Cup coverage if FIFA is simply included as part of the event's name. **Since "football" refers to a different sport in North America, prefer the word "[soccer](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/soccer/ "Soccer")"** in our journalism.


**Background**
Location: **South Africa**
Dates: **June 11 – July 11, 2010**

The World Cup is an **international soccer competition held every four years by the sport's global governing body, FIFA**. To participate, teams must have won enough matches in their respective divisions or confederations during the previous few years. (In 2010, Canada and more than 170 other countries failed to make the cut.) **The 32 national men's teams that qualify are divided into eight groups of four.** Each team plays the other three in its group. They're awarded three points for a win and one point for a tie. **The top two teams from each group go into the second phase of the tournament** (known as the Round of 16). **One-game eliminations begin** in Round 16 and subsequent head-to-head competitions. Each game is 90 minutes, with a 30-minute overtime in the case of a tie, and a series of shootouts if there's still no winner in OT. **Eventually, two teams earn a spot in the World Cup final** — the most widely watched sports match on the planet.


**Team names and nicknames**
**Apply standard CBC News style to country names** (e.g., North Korea rather than Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, the Netherlands not Holland, and Ivory Coast not Côte d'Ivoire). **But use England rather than Britain or the U.K.**, since Britain actually has several FIFA teams (e.g., Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales).

**We almost always identify teams by country in news coverage** (e.g., France plays South Africa). **Nicknames are fine in second reference, however, as long as the context makes the team's identity clear.** If definite articles appear in a nickname in a language other than English (e.g., El or La), capitalize (La Albirroja). But keep "the" lowercase in English (the Three Lions). And prefer English versions when there are options (e.g., Algeria's Desert Foxes rather than Les Fennecs). When teams have more than one nickname (e.g., Germany's Nationalelf or "national eleven" and Nationalmannschaft or "national team"), we prefer the most common (in this case Die Mannschaft, pronounced "DEE-man-shaft," which simply translates to "the Team"). **Here are the correct spellings:**

**Algeria** (Les Fennecs, the Desert Foxes)
**Argentina** (Albicelestes)
**Australia** (the Socceroos)
**Brazil** (Selecao)
**Cameroon** (the Indomitable Lions)
**Chile** (La Roja)
**Denmark** (Danish Dynamite, Olsen's Eleven)
**England** (the Three Lions)
**France** (Les Bleus)
**Germany** (if a nickname is used, prefer Die Mannschaft; also known as Die Nationalelf and Nationalmannschaft)
**Ghana** (the Black Stars)
**Greece** (Ethniki)
**Honduras** (Los Catrachos)
**Italy** (Azzurri)
**Ivory Coast** (Les Elephants)
**Japan** (Nippon Daihyo, the Blue Samurai)
**Mexico** (Los Tricolores, El Tri)
**Netherlands** (Oranje)
**New Zealand** (the All Whites)
**Nigeria** (Super Eagles)
**North Korea** (the Chollima)
**Paraguay** (La Albirroja)
**Portugal** (Seleccao das Quinas)
**Serbia** (Beli Orlovi, the White Eagles)
**Slovakia** (Repre)
**Slovenia** (Zmajceki)
**South Africa** (Bafana Bafana)
**South Korea** (Asian Tigers, Taeguk Warriors)
**Spain** (La Roja, La Furia Roja)
**Switzerland** (Schweizer Nati)
**Uruguay** (Los Charruas, La Celeste)
**United States** (Stars and Stripes)

**Players' names**
**To find the proper spelling of a player's name, as well as the phonetic pronunciation, click on his team's country below.** About 150 of the most commonly mistyped or misspoken proper nouns are listed. Last names always appear first. In a few cases, coaches are included. **Sometimes, soccer players are known by only a single name or nickname** (e.g., Brazil's superstar Edson Arantes do Nascimento was always called "Pele"). In the pronunciation list below, about a dozen athletes have only one name underlined for this reason. Many of these players are on Brazil's team.

### filibuster

**Filibuster**

Conventionally refers to **one or more people speaking at length in order to delay a vote or other business in a legislative body.
**
The term is sometimes applied to other obstruction tactics. But we prefer to **restrict "filibuster" to delays involving speech** (e.g., an MP reading from a phone book, a politician introducing legislation with a title spread out over 100 pages).

This narrower definition **avoids ambiguity** and, so, **makes our journalism clearer**. It **also reflects traditional definitions of "filibuster" in various books on parliamentary rules and practice**, including the [House of Commons Glossary of Parliamentary Procedure](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ourcommons.ca%2FAbout%2FGlossary%2FIndex-e.html%23LetterF&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0T7AIcoILDveCfiSaPVqqI).

There are **plenty of other ways to describe various opposition protests that don't involve virtually non-stop talking**, from "stonewalling" and "stalling strategies" to "procedural delays" and more specific descriptions, such as "all-night voting marathons."

The word filibuster originally comes from a Dutch term for pirates and other rebellious privateers. It was first applied to disruptions within legislative assemblies in the U.S. in the 1880s. In popular culture, the most famous filibuster is probably a 24-hour speech delivered by Jimmy Stewart on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the 1939 Frank Capra classic, _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_. Although the modern, political meaning of "filibuster" is less than two centuries old, the delay tactic, itself, was used at least as far back as ancient Rome, according to historians.


### fired

**Fire, fired, firing**

The terms fire, fired, firing are **entrenched colloquialisms for employment termination**. They're **OK as long as the facts fit** (e.g., the person has not been laid off, quit, retired, etc.).

Beyond conveying that the employee did not leave voluntarily, **words such as "fired" imply something other than economic downsizing.
**
Be aware that **some employers may try to couch a dismissal as mere restructuring**, and even brand the move with marketing obfuscation, such as workers being given "opportunities for change." **This sometimes mean assessing whether a word like "fired" applies, especially if there's any evidence of a potential conflict** (e.g., when a watchdog or whistleblower is terminated by a government). In such cases, **put the audience first by using clear, direct wording.** To avoid accusations of possible bias (e.g., pro-worker or pro-employer), **include fact-based descriptions that put use of "fired" into context** (e.g., a person's contract was suddenly terminated months or years early).

NOTE: **If it's clear that someone was forced to resign, it's OK to use the term "fired"** as long as the evidence is overwhelming and the details are put into context. Words such as **"ousted" and "removed" are also common** and acceptable. Generally **distinguish between a contract employee being released long before an agreement's expiration date** (i.e., they are "fired"), **and someone whose expiring contract is simply not extended or renewed** (i.e., they are "let go").

See also [contract dispute](/home/l#labourdispute) (instead of "labour dispute"), and [replacement worker](/home/r/replacement-worker).

### Fisheries and Oceans

**Fisheries and Oceans**

The official name of the ministry is the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans**, commonly known as the **DFO**. Although rebranded **Fisheries and Oceans Canada** in 2008, the ministry still operates under the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act**. The abbreviation DFO continues to surface in some government documents, and in some parts of the ministry's website.

For this reason, it's perfectly accurate to use the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in our journalism. The relatively entrenched abbreviation DFO also remains fine, especially in headlines.

But full, formal ministry names are not always required, so it's also OK to shorten the compound noun to something entrenched that our audience instantly recognizes (e.g., the **Fisheries Department**). Depending on a given story's facts, this can sometimes be further reduced to a single word (e.g., a **Fisheries** report), even in a web headline.

While there's nothing wrong with using the rebranded name Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the abbreviation **FOC is normally too obscure to be effective**, especially in headlines.

It's worth noting that Fisheries and Oceans has had many other names since 1867, including the Department of Naval Services and the Department of Marine and Fisheries — an example of the short shelf life of certain proper nouns in government.

### fisherman

**Fisherman, fishermen, fisher**

**The words _fisherman_ and _fishermen_ are acceptable** in news stories, although they're not the only terms available to journalists. **Alternatives include _people who fish_, _fishery workers, fish harvesters_ and _fishers_.** As a generic term, **"fisher" has become increasingly more popular since the start of the millennium**. Before that, it was more widely known as a type of weasel in many parts of North America.

**Reserve _angler_ for recreational fishing.** It does not apply to commercial fishermen.

**Be aware that some members of the fishery strongly oppose being called _fishers_,** including certain women who work in it, and who proudly insist on being called _fishermen_. **Respect individual preferences when known**.

NOTE: For several years, some CBC News units insisted on _fishers_ while others permitted _fishermen_. In 2003, the Editor in Chief's Office clarified CBC News style and ruled that the word _fishermen_ is OK on radio, television and digital platforms. This has been revisited and reaffirmed several times since, including in 2018 and 2020. For a longer discussion of the old debate, see the August 2000 Words: Woe and Wonder column [Men, Women and Fishers](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Ffishermen.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0SiuspcUJqwl_I3V8pK9Ay).



### flu

**Flu**

**Flu is short for _influenza_**, a highly contagious infection caused by viruses. **Either word is acceptable in first reference.** Symptoms can include fever, severe aches and coughing.

[3 broad categories](/home/f/flu#categories) (Type A, Type B, Type C) 

['Swine flu' versus H1N1](/home/f/flu#swineflu) (CBC News style) 

**3 broad categories**

**Type A**
This is the most common in humans. It includes seasonal flu. The most serious and widespread outbreaks of influenza have also been Type A, including the 1918 flu pandemic that killed tens of millions.


**Type B**
Although it can cause epidemics, this influenza tends to be milder than Type A.


**Type C**
Much rarer and also usually much-less severe. Experts say Type C has never been associated with an epidemic.

Keep in mind that **it's the size of an outbreak rather than the severity of the contagious illness that determines whether it's considered an actual [epidemic or pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic).**


**H1N1, H5N1, etc.**
**Only Type A influenza is classified using the H and N system**, which reflects various combinations of proteins that microbiologists know all about but most of us fail to grasp or remember. **In news stories, it's sometimes valuable to include this additional information** (e.g., H2N2) **to distinguish between different types of Type A flu**, (e.g., a Type A flu of the H1N1 strain or the H1N1 influenza A virus), **although a colloquial name** (e.g., swine or avian flu) **is often enough in first reference, depending on context.**
For instance, **H1N1** is one new strain of swine flu first reported in Mexico in early 2009 (evidence suggests it actually surfaced in that country in 2008), while **H5N1** is one strain of avian flu. Such alphanumeric coding is usually optional during reports of particular outbreaks, especially since they are not unique to a particular flu (i.e., there's more than type of H1N1 influenza). The Russian flu of 1977, for instance, was also classified as H1N1. A different type of **[swine flu](/home/s#swineflu)** is called H1N2.


**'Swine flu' versus H1N1**
It's **OK to use swine flu in first reference** (headlines and leads), but not mandatory. It's **common to use H1N1 after that**, but there's flexibility, depending on the length of the story. **Graphics on TV and online should use H1N1**. When adding scientific context in second reference, options include: the **H1N1 influenza virus**, the **H1N1 flu virus**, the **H1N1 flu** and the **H1N1 virus**. Avoid hyphens, slashes, etc., in compound adjectives: **swine flu vaccine, H1N1 flu shot**, etc. It's a [Type A flu](/home/f/flu#categories).

See also Esther Enkin's Inside CBC News blog post, [We are not renaming swine flu](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fwe-are-not-renaming-swine-flu-1.788116&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3qoJATB1vQdxuBoS7nF8ok), from May 2009 for details on the decision against banning the term swine flu from stories about the H1N1 virus.


**Limit scientific jargon**
If alphanumeric coding is added to a story to clarify a particular point, extra detail is not normally required — even though a longer label may be used in the official, scientific name of a given form of influenza, such as the year or location of the initial outbreak: _H1N1 (2008, Mexico) influenza A virus_. Depending on context, much shorter options are available, including: [**swine flu** and **H1N1 flu**](/home/f/flu#swineflu) as outlined above. If extra information is added to a label, pick the most meaningful fact. For example, if a new strain of a virus appeared in 2008 but an actual pandemic broke a year or two later, it would make more sense to our audience to tie the name to current coverage (i.e., to describe it as the 2009 H1N1 flu or the 2010 H1N1 flu). If the strain has mutated, this fact is worth reporting at the time of the new outbreak.

In a health or science feature, of course, more background might be called for when explaining, say, what the H (hemagglutinin) and the N (neuraminidase) stand for, and how Type A is broken down into 16 H (H1-H16) and nine N (N1-N9) subtypes. But in daily news coverage **there’s generally no need to pile on scientific jargon**, especially since all obscure terms need to be defined for a broad audience. Use your judgment.


**'Stomach flu'**
**The term "stomach flu" is a common and acceptable label for gastroenteritis.** Although some symptoms are flu-like, **gastroenteritis is not influenza.** It's actually an inflamed or severely irritated stomach or intestinal tract. Unlike influenza, which is caused by a virus, gastroenteritis may be caused by a bacteria, a virus, a parasite, etc. **Do not shorten "stomach flu" to "flu" in stories.** Instead, report specific details that are known (e.g., if it was caused by tainted food or contaminated water).

See also [**bacteria versus virus**](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) for related guidelines, including the difference between a **vaccine** and an **antiviral drug**, what a **non-adjuvant** injection means, etc.

### foot-and-mouth disease

**Foot-and-mouth disease**

The name is lowercase and with hyphens. It's sometimes shortened to FMD, but _avoid_ this abbreviation in news stories.

Some scientists call it aphthous fever, but we don't have to.

Although the disease affects cloven-hoofed animals, its common name begins with the word **"foot," not hoof**. Do _not_ change it to hoof.

Don't confuse it with "hand-foot-and-mouth disease," an illness contracted by humans.

For a general discussion on the use of the word "foot" in a disease that's associated mainly with cattle and sheep, read the Words: Woe & Wonder column, [Foot or hoof: A sole choice?](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fhoofoot.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1tKXFWF0NCpraPmazo3m2Z)

### football

**Football terms**

backup centre, ball carrier, ball club, blitz (n., v.), bootleg, end line, end zone, field goal, fourth-and-one (adj.), fullback, goal line (two words), goal-line stand, halfback, halftime, handoff, kick off (v.), kickoff (n., adj.), left guard, linebacker, lineman, nose tackle, offside, out of bounds (adv.), out-of-bounds (adj.), pitchout (n.), place kick, placekicker, play off (v.), playoff (n., adj.), quarterback, runback (n.), running back, tailback, tight end, touchback, touchdown

Do not confuse the Saskatchewan [Roughriders](/home/r#Roughriders) with the Ottawa Rough Riders, which folded in 1996.

### Non-English words, foreign languages, accents

**Non-English words, foreign languages, accents**

[Italics](/home/f/foreign-words#italics) (_caveat emptor_, but ad nauseam)
[Standard roman alphabet](/home/f/foreign-words#roman_alphabet) ("th" not "þ")
[Preferred transliterations](/home/f/foreign-words#transliterations) (Cologne not "Köln" Germany)
[Accents](/home/f/foreign-words#accents) (El Niño, but Mexico not "México")
[Phonetics](/home/f/foreign-words#phonetics) (optional, parenthetical detail)


**NOTE: Foreign language is defined here as a language that's not known to most English-speaking Canadians.** Some people in English Canada also speak German or Italian or Arabic or Cree or Ojibwa or Blackfoot or numerous other tongues. But to most English speakers, these are foreign languages. In this sense, the modifier "foreign" does not mean "external." It also does not mean "original" or native, since Indigenous languages were spoken in North America long before English. Rather, "foreign" is a relative expression that helps underscore what is still non-English (e.g., _cause célèbre_, _schadenfreude_, and _carpe diem_) versus words with foreign roots that are now considered English (premiere, haiku, gesundheit and toboggan). The latter often have entrenched English spellings and pronunciations. To an unilingual English speaker in Canada, therefore, French, Spanish, Cree, etc., are all foreign languages, in the same way that, to an English speaker living in Japan, "Japanese" is a foreign language.


**Italics**
**CBC News reports in English**, just as Radio-Canada reports in French. **Generic, non-English words should appear in italics if not relatively well-established** as part of our language. The Canadian Oxford is our guide. For instance:


> **ITALICS**
> _au revoir_
> _caveat emptor
> __favela_
> _objet d'art
> __persona non grata
> __schadenfreude
> __shoji_
> **
> NO ITALICS**
> ad nauseam
> bona fide
> carte blanche
> glasnost
> haiku
> mujahedeen
> perestroika


See the [italics overview](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) for more details and examples.

**Standard roman alphabet**
**Use familiar A to Z characters in virtually all cases. The main exceptions are Indigenous languages in Canada**, which have special status. (See [Indigenous spellings and phonetics](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/indigenous/#spellings "Indigenous") for details.)

For some languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese), the original text needs to be converted from entirely different writing systems through a process known as "romanization." For other languages, words from one alphabet are transliterated into another (e.g., variations of Cyrillic letters used in Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, etc.).

**Always use English forms when they're entrenched** (e.g., Peter the Great not "Pyotr the Great").

**Be aware that some languages use slight variations of the standard roman alphabet**. For instance, Icelandic features a couple of old characters like "thorn" (þ) dropped from English words long ago. In these cases, **use modern English lettering when conventions exist** (e.g., "th" for "þ") because they're more widely understood by our audience. By contrast, an alphabet like Norway's uses a slash called a "miniature" in the letter o sometimes ("ø") to indicate a specific vowel sound. We report entrenched ø spellings (e.g., Thorbjørn) because they're not overly confusing or jarring to our readers.

**Also be aware that some alphabets may look deceptively similar to the roman alphabet at first blush, but are actually considerably different** upon closer examination. Modern Latvian, for example, uses 33 letters. It has no Qs or Ws. It also has more than one distinct form of some other letters, such as As, Cs, Gs and Ks, modified by diacritical markings. **In most cases, we follow the English convention of transliterating spellings from such languages into the standard roman alphabet**, especially when English versions are already reasonably well established (e.g., **Camp Adazi** rather than "Camp Ādaži" for the **military base in Latvia**, which the locals write as "Latvija"). The most common exceptions are people's names when specific spelling preferences, including accents, are known. While we get periodic audience complaints from individuals who think CBC News should always use foreign spellings and dialectical markings based on the principles of accuracy and respect, the reality is that **we report in English, and, so, need to make decisions about orthography that best serve our English audience.** At the end of the day, using an English spelling like Camp Adazi instead of the Latvian spelling Camp Ādaži is no different from, say, a Latvian news organization spelling Canada, Quebec and New Brunswick as "Kanāda," "Kvebeka" and "Ņūbransvika," respectively.

**Preferred transliterations**
**When deciding between alternative English spellings** of foreign names and words, **generally pick the most familiar or entrenched version** (e.g.,Rachmaninoff instead of "Rakhmaninov"). If you're not sure, check the Language Guide for declared preferences (e.g., al-Qaeda instead of al-Qaida).

**Be aware that preferred transliterations can change over time** (e.g., czar instead of tsar). This includes proper nouns (e.g., Beijing, Mao Zedong, and Mumbai rather than Peking, Mao Tse-tung and Bombay). For this reason, **we sometimes abandon old, entrenched spellings for editorial reasons** (e.g., Ukraine's shift from old Russian spellings, such as "Kiev" to "Kyiv").

For details and other examples, see [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations)

**Accents**
**Add diacritical markings to foreign words, including proper nouns** (e.g., people's names) **when accurate and appropriate.** "Accurate" means **known/confirmed**. "Appropriate" means that **no common, accent-free English forms are entrenched** (e.g., we write Mexico rather than "México"):


> **ACCENTS**
> António Guterres
> Céline Dion
> communiqué
> El Niño
> exposé
> Eyjafjallajökull
> fiancé
> Götterdämmerung
> Gwìch’i
> Jonas Gahr Støre
> La Niña
> ménage à trois
> Nil Köksal
> Plácido Domingo
> raison d'être
> Saša Petricic
> tête-à-tête
>
> **NO ACCENTS** (because alternatives are entrenched)
> Baha'i faith (not "Bahá'í faith")
> Benedictine (not "Bénédictine" for herbal liqueur; see [wines, spirits](/home/w/wines_spirits))
> Haiti (not "Haïti")
> inukshuk (not "iñuksuk")
> Mexico (not "México")
> Montreal rather than "Montréal" (except in proper nouns like "Le Journal de Montréal")
> Munich (not "München")
> Nuremberg (not "Nürnberg")
> Peru (not "Perú")
> Quebec rather than "Québec" (excpet in proper nouns like "Hydro-Québec")
> pinatas (not "piñatas")
> Thordis Thorhallsdottiri rather than "Þórdís Þórhallsdóttir" (Icelandic politician)


**Be aware that French requires special care** because of its unique history in Canada. See [**French words and accents**](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for detailed guidelines and examples.


NOTE: **We began routinely adding accents to foreign languages that use traditional roman lettering** (e.g., Italian, German, Spanish) **in March 2019.** Previously, we primarily included accents in French words only. **This shift in style was adopted for two reasons:**


> **(i) An increase in the use of accents by various people and groups in Canada**, prompting requests to match these spellings whenever practical; and
>
> **(ii) Technical improvements**, making it easier to display a bigger range of diacritical markings on digital platforms, including mobile devices.


**Never assume diacritical markings are correct.** It's better to leave out accents than to add incorrect ones. **When omitting accents, be aware that standard guidelines may apply.** The [German name](/home/g/german-names) Göbbels, for instance, would normally appear as Goebbels in English, following the convention of inserting an "e" after the applicable vowel. And _danke schön_, which means "thank you very much" in German, would become _danke schoen_.

**Do not confuse the French accent tréma** (e.g., the ë in Michaëlle Jean) **with an umlaut** (e.g., the ü in Düsseldorf, which we would write as Duesseldorf).

**If a diacritical mark is used, make certain that it's the right accent over the correct letter.** Even familiar words can be messed up when people aren't careful. Consider this blunder: In 1992, Canada Post had to reprint a Christmas stamp because the original design mistakenly spelled _Noël_ as "_Nöel_."

Unless entrenched English forms exist, **generally match spellings — including accents — of foreign place names, building names, etc., found on official signage** featuring the roman alphabet. For instance, go with a capital É in the name of a famous Paris building (Élysée Palace), and the name of a famous Paris street (Champs-Élysées).

**Ignore invented umlauts** (e.g., Haagen-Daz ice cream, not Häagen-Daz, and Motley Crue, not Mötley Crüe).

**Phonetics**
We routinely add phonetics to broadcast scripts to boost accurate, consistent pronunciation of unfamiliar words, including proper nouns from foreign languages. **Phonetics are sometimes added to published text** as well. Depending on the story, **parenthetical pronunciations can help our audience confronted by unusual accents and/or long, daunting spellings.**

In stories written for the eye (e.g., web articles), the easiest approach is to use brackets, with uppercase letters for syllabic stress:


> Iceland's **Eyjafjallajökull** (pronounced AY-uh-fyoot-luh-YUH-kootl-uh) last erupted in ...
> The Cree word _**mâmawêyatitân**_ (pronounced MAW-maw-way-AT-ah-tin) means ...
> **Stó:lō** (pronounced 'STAW-loh) leaders say the project ...


Such detail is optional on digital platforms like CBCNews.ca. When adding phonetics, always check the [CBC Pronunciation Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XFPfiGVRPwO63-NkaNyUm) first to see if there's a preferred in-house style. Also, follow the [CBC Phonetics Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/cbc.ca/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2JjLmNhfGxhbmd1YWdlZ3VpZGV8Z3g6NzQxNzEyNzFhYjI3ZWZlYw) when spelling out vowel and consonant sounds.

**Overview**
**Although CBC News publishes and broadcasts in English, French words frequently surface in our journalism.** This is particularly true of proper nouns, such as the names of people, certain organizations and geographical locations.

**As a Crown corporation in a country with two official languages, we treat French with special care.** In 1994, Ottawa identified the CBC as one of several federal institutions with a major role in implementing the country's Official Languages Act. We're committed to "fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society."

**In 2006, the CBC established editorial guidelines for the logical and consistent use of accents, italics, capital letters and so forth in French words we publish in our English news coverage.**

For example, our style is:


Métis leaders are urging Quebec to sign the accord.
She met her fiancé at the University of Quebec in Montreal.
He led the Parti Québécois from 1996 to 2001.
"It's a _fait accompli_," complained Quebec's premier.
She plans to resign Friday, according to Le Journal de Montréal.
St-Jean-Baptiste Day is better known as _Fête nationale_ in Quebec.
Hydro-Québec said it hopes to have power restored by Monday.
One of the investors is the _Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec_.
"_Vive le Québec libre,_" de Gaulle told the cheering crowd.

Several other national news organizations in Canada, such as CP and the Globe and Mail, follow a similar approach when including French words in English text.

**A few in-house style preferences are worth emphasizing:**

-   French words considered part of everyday English (e.g., fiancé) are not in italics.
-   Most words considered French rather than English (e.g., _fait accompli_) are in italics.
-   For generic French words or phrases, we follow the spelling and capitalization featured in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (e.g., resumé not _résumé_, and _coup d'état_ not _coup d'État_).
-   Newspaper names (French or English) are not in italics.
-   French geographical names (Trois-Rivières) are not in italics and generally follow English capitalization — i.e., uppercase letters are featured at the start of principal words.
-   English versions of "pan-Canadian" names (Quebec not Québec) are always used, unless the French form is part of a proper noun (Hydro-Québec).
-   French names of organizations that either officially or conventionally follow English capitalization (e.g., Les Grands Ballets Canadiens) are not in italics.
-   French names of organizations that do not follow English capitalization (e.g., _Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec_) are in italics to help flag these nouns for readers.
-   The titles of artistic works (French or English), such as novels or movies, are in italics.
-   The titles of French news programs (e.g., _Le Téléjournal_) follow English capitalization.
-   The titles of French artistic works follow English capitalization only if the uppercase lettering is established through convention (e.g., _Les Misérables_ but _La détresse et l'enchantement_).

For journalists accustomed to "French" versus "English" typography, it's worth noting that different approaches are taken by websites that serve primarily French audiences (such as Radio-Canada.ca).

**Detailed CBC News guidelines and other examples are outlined below.**

**French accents – A matter of consistency and accuracy**
**Include accents on French words that aren't already part of everyday English, as long as you're certain that these diacritical markings are correct.** When verifying French words or names, check our internal style manual or a reliable external source. Consulting broadcast scripts is not sufficient.

CBC-sanctioned publishing tools give online writers and editors quick access to all standard uppercase and lowercase diacritics. Avoid adding raw HTML, which can cause technical problems.

  

  **GENERAL NAME**

  **SPECIFIC ACCENT**

  acute (_aigu_)

  é, É

  grave (_grave_)

  à, è, ù, À, È, Ù

  circumflex (_circonflexe_)

  â, ê, î, ô, û, Â, Ê, Î, Ô, Û 

  diaeresis (_tréma_)

  ë, ï, ü, Ë, Ï, Ü

  cedilla (_cédille_)

  ç, Ç

Using accents consistently, according to set criteria, makes our text more sensible to readers. We're not left referring to Jean Chrétien, Gaspé, Parti Québécois or café in one sentence and then, for no logical reason, to Michaelle Jean, Rene Levesque, communique or cliche in the next (instead of Michaëlle Jean, René Lévesque, communiqué and cliché).

French accents also reinforce accuracy in our journalism. As the Editors' Association of Canada points out in its manual Editing Canadian English, French diacritics are "as much a component of correct spelling as the letters they appear with." In other words, turning Stéphane Dion into "Stephane Dion" is just one step shy of calling him "Stephen."

Of course, **some French words do not require accents because of convention. In other instances, the diacritical marks are dropped based on the established preference of an individual or organization.**

**Café, communiqué and protege**
**French words that are now part of our common English vocabulary**, such as café and protege, **do not need to be in italics.** They often have no accents or limited accents (resumé instead of the original French _résumé_).

**The [Canadian Oxford Dictionary](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfordreference.com%2Fview%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780195418163.001.0001%2Facref-9780195418163&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2mRZaIul-Z7mN0jH4lOO-e) is our main guide**. Here are some examples:

**Before checking the dictionary, CBC News journalists should always consult this Language Guide first to see if there's a well-established exception to Oxford (such as our use of Métis instead of Metis, and naiveté instead of naïveté), or an exception to Canadian Press (such as our use of premiere instead of première).**


Keep in mind that while a term's etymology may be French, the word may very well be treated as English now. Obvious examples are the prefixes "Anglo" and "Franco":

> anglophone (lowercase, no italics; but prefer adj. "English-speaking")
>
> Anglo-Quebecer
>
> Franco-Manitoban (not _franco-manitobain_)
>
> Franco-Ontarian (not _franco-ontarien_)
>
> francophone (lowercase, no italics; but prefer adj. "French-speaking")
>
> Quebecer (a resident of Quebec; no accent or italics)
>
> Québécois (accents but no italics; a francophone native of Quebec)

**_Fait accompli? C'est la vie_**
**Most French words are still considered foreign** (i.e., non-English). **These need to be in italics.** For example, _en fête_ (preparing for or holding a celebration) versus the verb "fete" (to honour), and _aide-mémoire_ (an aid to memory) versus "memoir" (an autobiographical account).

**We take direction from the Canadian Oxford in most cases,** including whether to follow an "English" form of lowercase or uppercase lettering (e.g., _coup d'état_ rather than the traditional French capitalization _coup d'État_, which literally means "stroke of the State"):

> _agent provocateur_
>
> _aide-mémoire_
>
> _au revoir_
>
> _beau geste_
>
> _bien pensant_
>
> _cause célèbre_
>
> _c'est la vie_
>
> _comme ci, comme ça_
>
> _coup de grâce_
>
> _coup d'état_
>
> _danse macabre_
>
> _eh bien_
>
> _enfant terrible_
>
> _en fête_
>
> _esprit de corps_
>
> _fait accompli_
>
> _Fête nationale_ (prefer St-Jean-Baptiste Day for this June 24 holiday)
>
> _la belle province_
>
> _merci_
>
> _mésalliance_
>
> _n'est-ce pas?_
>
> _nom de plume_
>
> _non_
>
> _objet d'art_
>
> _oui_
>
> _pensée_
>
> _tout de suite_


See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) for more details, including guidelines for Latin (_persona non grata_ versus ad hoc).

**People's names**
One of the Fathers of Confederation, George-Étienne Cartier, used the English form of George rather than the French ("Georges") in honour of King George III. It's a reminder that names can be tricky, if not a royal pain.

**We're expected to spell people's names correctly** (e.g., MacDonald, Macdonald, McDonald, or some other variation). **In the case of French accents, this means following known preferences:**

> Jean Béliveau
>
> Geneviève Bujold
>
> Jean Chrétien
>
> Stéphane Dion
>
> Anne Hébert
>
> Michaëlle Jean
>
> Paul-Émile Léger
>
> René Lévesque
>
> François Mitterrand
>
> Jeanne Sauvé


**Don't make assumptions about diacritical markings inside or outside of Quebec.** In 2005, Ontario appointed André Marin as the province's ombudsman. On the other hand, Jean-Luc Pepin (a Trudeau-era cabinet minister from Quebec) dropped the accent in his name when writing in both English and French.

The names of high-profile people are fairly easy to determine. In the case of Marin and Pepin, for instance, numerous official provincial and federal documents clearly show whether to include an accent. And with a search engine such as Google, it takes only seconds to find the official website of [Roméo Dallaire](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.romeodallaire.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1Rk3uKtwEdOWg2TDZ15Y5l) to see how the retired Canadian lieutenant-general's name should be spelled. (You can also clearly see the accent on the cover of his book, _Shake Hands With the Devil_.)

Of course, **we don't limit diacritics to an elite — e.g., politicians, famous ex-soldiers and governors general. But we do accept that some preferences will be harder to determine than others,** even in the case of someone moving into Rideau Hall.

When **Michaëlle Jean** was named governor general-designate in 2005, for example, virtually all large English media outlets in Canada included the diaeresis (_e tréma_). But few bothered to add an acute accent to her daughter's name for several days: **Marie-Éden**. Once the correct spelling was known, however, the "É" was widely embraced. (Note: CBC.ca's French colleagues, Radio-Canada.ca, used Marie-Éden from the start. But outside of Quebec, it took a phone call from CBCNews.ca to Rideau Hall to confirm the accent and get the Governor General's official website corrected.)


**'But I didn't know it was Nadège'**
If writing about Michaëlle Jean's time as a child in Haiti, we should refer to the regime of dictator **François (Papa Doc) Duvalier**, since this is a well-known historical figure. The country itself would have no accent — **Haiti** not "Haïti" — because this is an entrenched English convention. (See [geographical names](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#geographicaldomestic) below for more details).

If mentioning Jean's uncle **René Depestre**, we should have no trouble determining that his name includes an acute accent because he's a published author.

But leaving out the grave accent in her sister's name (**Nadège**), for instance, would be justified only if we had been unaware of its existence. **Ignoring a correct French accent intentionally is unacceptable.**

**
Flag clashes between sources**
**Some names appear in more than one way, of course, depending on the source.**

For years, for instance, we followed the Canadian Oxford's spelling of the country's twelfth prime minister, Louis St. Laurent, since this anglicized version of the name had become relatively common in news coverage of his time in office in the 1940s and 50s.

But for consistency we now use his original (French) preference, Louis St-Laurent, which is also the spelling found in Parliament of Canada publications, the Library of Parliament, the Dictionary of Canadian Biography and the Canadian Encyclopedia. (The Canadian Press, which previously used Saint-Laurent, also switched to St-Laurent in 2005).

**When two different spellings are offered by sources that seem equally reliable, flag the clash and request a ruling.**

See also [Verifying accents and spellings](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#verifying) at the bottom of this page for guidance on breaking stories and tips on sources.

**Geographical names in Canada**
**For the names of domestic cities, towns, villages, lakes, rivers, etc., we generally follow the official spellings adopted by the [Canadian Geographical Names Board of Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf)**. In addition to adding correct accents, this means **we embrace the common practice of using hyphens instead of periods or spaces** in French place names featuring two or more words:

> Gaspé
>
> Saint-Jérôme
>
> Sept-Îles (**not** Seven Islands)
>
> Trois-Rivières (**not** Three Rivers)


**French accents are dropped if English forms have been established through convention.** The Geographical Names Board lists a few dozen such "[pan-Canadian](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcan.gc.ca%2Fearth-sciences%2Fgeography%2Fplace-names%2Feducation-resources%2F9232&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2jxvoz_g6XyIDVEW3RhXvw)" entries (i.e., communities with two different and equally acceptable English and French spellings). In these rare cases, we always use the English form:

> Lake Champlain (**not** "Lac Champlain")
>
> Montreal (**not** Montréal)
>
> Quebec (**not** Québec)
>
> Quebec City (the uppercase "C" is akin to New York City)
>
> Saguenay River (**not** Rivière Saguenay)
>
> St. Lawrence River (**not** "Fleuve Saint-Laurent")


**Exceptions are made only when such pan-Canadian geographical names are part of a French proper noun** (e.g., Le Journal de Montréal and Hydro-Québec).

**Always use English names of buildings, parks, bridges, etc., if these have been established** (e.g., the Jacques Cartier Bridge rather than "le pont Jacques-Cartier" or the "Jacques-Cartier Bridge"). If you're not sure an official English form exists, check a relevant, reliable source (in this case, the Federal Bridge Corporation's website).


**A special note about hyphens**
**Even in the case of geographical names with two or more words, no hyphen is required if the only other word is a definite article** (such as "La"). Sometimes this article is fused to the main word:

> La Morandière (a Quebec village)
>
> L'Épiphanie (a Quebec city)


**Hyphens are not usually included in the names of geographical features, such as lakes, rivers or mountains:**

> Île Lamèque (a New Brunswick Island)
>
> Lac à la Truite (a Quebec lake)


**But hyphens are often included when the names of geographical features** (such as lakes, rivers or mountains) **are part of a community's name:**

> Baie-Comeau (a Quebec city)
>
> Île-à-la-Crosse (a Saskatchewan village)
>
> Îles-de-la-Madeleine a.k.a. [Magdalen Islands](/home/m#Magdalen_Islands) (Quebec islands that are also municipalities)
>
> Lac-à-la-Tortue (a Quebec community)
>
> Rivière-Verte (a New Brunswick village)


**The federal government's database listed above provides correct spellings, including the proper use of hyphens and accents**. But taking the time to become familiar with the above rules will help you spot typos in stories.

Keep in mind that there can be subtle differences in punctuation and spelling of similar words in different parts of the country. For instance, see [St., Saint, St-, Sainte, Ste-](/home/s/st-saint-ste) for caveats about various forms of "Saint" and "Sainte" found inside and outside of Quebec (e.g., Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. versus Saint-Antoine, N.B.). 


**Geographical names abroad**
**For communities outside Canada, we follow the National Geographic Atlas of the World** (e.g., Nîmes, France) **unless English forms have been established through convention** (e.g., Haiti not Haïti, Munich not München, and Ivory Coast instead of "Côte d'Ivoire"). Our preferred international atlas, also used by Canadian Press, generally includes the established English forms in parentheses.

In the case of international French place names, the same pattern of accents and hyphens are common around the globe. Some foreign words have different slightly different spellings (Élysée versus Élysées) depending on context. For instance, the French president's official residence is the Élysée Palace, which is not far from the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

**Street names and addresses**
**Quebec street names frequently require hyphens. Our spellings of principal words should reflect what's on the sign** (including any accents), **although we should use standard English forms** (capitalization and location) **of generic labels** (Street, Boulevard, etc.) to help our readers since these are not technically considered part of the official name:

> Côte-des-Neiges Road (**not** "chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges")
>
> De Maisonneuve Boulevard (**not** "boulevard de Maisonneuve")
>
> Rivière-des-Prairies Boulevard (**not** "boul. Rivière-des-Prairies")
>
> Ste-Catherine Street (**not** "rue Sainte-Catherine")
>
> St-Denis Street (**not** "St. Denis Street" or "rue Saint-Denis")
>
> 1400 René-Lévesque Blvd. E. (**not** "1400, boul. René-Lévesque Est")


Consult a good street map if you're unsure of a specific spelling. See [addresses](/home/a/addresses) for general guidelines on when to abbreviate words such as "Boulevard" and "East."

**Names of organizations**
**In general, we prefer the conventional English versions of organizations' names** (e.g., Doctors without Borders rather than Médecins Sans Frontières) **unless these are not well-established or if acceptable translations are impossible.**

**When a body's French name is used, English descriptions should be provided** in a subordinate clause or in the next sentence — **except in cases when the meaning is already widely understood** or can be readily inferred.

> Bloc Québécois (**no** English translation or description required)
>
> _Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec_ (the province's public pension fund)
>
> _Centrale des syndicats du Québec_ (the province's largest teachers union)
>
> Hydro-Québec (**no** English translation or description required)
>
> Montreal Transit Corp. (**not** _Société de transport de Montréal_)
>
> Parti Québécois (**no** English translation or description required)
>
> Quebec Labour Federation 

> > (**not** _Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec_)

> Quebec Liquor Corp. (**not** _Société des alcools du Québec_)
>
> Sûreté du Québec (Quebec provincial police)


**Use the English names of provincial government departments, courts and most other official bodies:**

Quebec Court of Appeal (**not** la Cour d'appel du Québec)
Quebec's Department of Justice (**not** _ministère de la Justice_)
Quebec National Assembly (**not** _Assemblée nationale du Québec_)

**Be aware that there are sometimes subtle but important differences in the entrenched English forms of French proper nouns** (e.g., a word such as "association" dropped). In such cases, **prefer the English usage most common in that province:**

> Quebec Bar (**not** the Barreau du Québec and **not** the Quebec Bar Association)


**Organizations sometimes include accents in only the French version of their names, especially when these nouns feature what are known as "[pan-Canadian](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcan.gc.ca%2Fearth-sciences%2Fgeography%2Fplace-names%2Feducation-resources%2F9232&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2jxvoz_g6XyIDVEW3RhXvw)" words** (e.g., Montreal/Montréal or Quebec/Québec). For instance, Québecor has an accent in French but has been known for decades in English as Quebecor Inc. or simply Quebecor. **No accent is required in CBC News stories in these cases** (i.e., write Quebecor). This is akin to Radio-Canada adding accents to established French versions of nouns for its audience (e.g., Bell Média and Cogeco Câble instead of Bell Media or Cogeco Cable).

See [Capitalization and italics](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#capitalization) below for guidelines governing nouns such as Action Démocratique du Québec (ADQ) and Québec Solidaire (QS), as well as [Use English conventions in certain translations of names](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#englishconventions) for related guidelines and examples, such as chief electoral officer instead of directeur général des élections.


**Retain established or familiar English names**
While CBC News style generally follows a specific organization's official preference, we also tend to **lean toward an English version of a name if this has become entrenched through long use or is considered the most familiar or comprehensible to our national audience:**

> Les Grands Ballets Canadiens (adding "de Montréal" is unnecessary)

> > (second reference: Les Grands; the ballet company)

> the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO)

> > (second reference options: MSO; the symphony; the orchestra)

> the Opéra de Montréal

> > (second reference: the opera company)

> the Royal 22nd Regiment (**not** the "Royal 22e Régiment")

> > (second reference: the 22nd; the regiment; the Van Doos)

> University of Quebec in Montreal
>
> University of Moncton


Sometimes confusion arises when previously used English names are largely abandoned by the group in question. The Canadian Encyclopedia of Canada, for instance, points out that the _Orchestre symphonique de Montréal_ (OSM) adopted a bilingual name in 1953, but then officially dropped the English version in 1979.

But the name "Montreal Symphony Orchestra" (MSO) continues to be widely used, including on many CBC Radio music programs. The English form of the name is also still frequently found in the Montreal Gazette, The Canadian Press and at the bottom of the orchestra's own website. It is the preference of CBC News as well.

The same is true of the University of Montreal. Although the school's documentation features the "Université de Montréal" almost exclusively, including throughout its English website, this French version is uncommon outside of Quebec.

Since CBCNews.ca is the online division of the corporation's main English news service, **it's often instructive to look at how certain French nouns are handled on air when deciding whether to prefer the English form on the web.** For example, we write Quebec's "Royal 22nd Regiment" rather than "Royal 22e Régiment" since that is how this infantry unit is best known in English Canada. CBC Radio and TV broadcasters do not say "Royal 22e Régiment" in French in the middle of English newscasts. They do, however, use the acceptable nickname "the Van Doos" (an English version of the French word for 22nd, _vingt-deuxième_). We also use Van Doos in headlines and second reference. (See [military forces](/home/m/military-forces) for related guidelines on regiment and battalion names.)

**An abridged version of a French name is occasionally acceptable and preferable in first reference. For example, we can write Montreal's Orchestre Métropolitain** (instead of the Orchestre Métropolitain du Grand Montréal), with either the Orchestre Métropolitain or "the orchestra" used in subsequent references. Two criteria should be considered in these cases: Is a shortened French name endorsed (i.e., sometimes used) by the organization itself? Does posting the shortened version on CBC.ca help our readers?

**Capitalization and italics (proper nouns)**
**There are several different approaches to capitalization in French.** Under one system, only the first letter of an organization's name is capitalized, along with any proper nouns. For example, _la Cour suprême du Canada_ for the Supreme Court of Canada. **When considered part of the formal name, the "L" in the first definite article** (Le, La, L' or Les) **is also uppercase**. Under a more traditional and complex system, the first regular noun after the article also takes an initial capital letter, along with any intervening adjectives.

**In general, follow the capitalization preference of individual organizations**. This is the simplest approach for our English journalists because it does not require thorough knowledge of, and judgments calls about, various parts of French speech.

**If the capitalization preference of the French name is close to standard English** (with uppercase letters clearly flagging the noun), **italics are not required. Otherwise, the entire name should be in italics to help our readers:**

> Chez Mes Amis (a charity that provides meals to seniors in Montreal)
>
> the _Confédération des syndicats nationaux_ (confederation of provincial unions)
>
> Cirque du Soleil (no description required)
>
> École Polytechnique (an engineering school in Montreal)
>
> _Union des producteurs agricoles_ (the farmers union in Quebec)


See the note on [Le, La](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#articles) below for more examples.

**Sometimes, imposing English capitalization on certain common French nouns is much better for our readers than using italics and lowercase lettering** — especially when this approach has become conventional over time. The names of Quebec political parties are an obvious example. Although _Parti québécois_ is the official French version, Parti Québécois has become widely accepted in the English media. So our style is:

> Action Démocratique du Québec — **not** _Action démocratique du Québec_

> > (second reference options: ADQ or Action Démocratique)

> Bloc Québécois — **not** _Bloc québécois_

> > (second reference options: prefer the Bloc, but BQ is OK in headlines)

> Coalition Avenir Québec — **not** _Coalition avenir Québec_ 

> > (second reference: CAQ)

> Parti Québécois — **not** _Parti québécois_

> > (second reference: PQ)

> Québec Solidaire — **not** _Québec solidaire_

> > (second reference: QS) 

See [Party versus party](/home/p/party) for related guidelines, such as preferring the possessive term PQ's over the awkward but correct Parti Québécois's. Another example is Montreal's transit system, which is often written as "METRO" on local subway signs or as "metro" to match the French capitalization, _métro_. By contrast, CBC News adds an initial cap to make scanning easier for our audience. This approach also matches our overall style for transit systems (e.g., the Washington Metro, the London Underground).

> Montreal Metro (**not** _métro or chemin de fer métropolitain_ or "metro")

> > (second reference: Metro)


In recent years, initial uppercase letters have become more common in French (just as there has been a rise in unorthodox use of lowercase lettering in English, such as eBay and iPod). The capital "S" in Soleil above (in both the French and English versions of this performing troupe's name) is one example.

This has led to some notable differences in preferences:

> the Alliance Française (considered a global leader in French instruction)
>
> _Office québécois de la langue française_ (office in charge of Quebec's language law)


The former non-profit network's decision to adopt an uppercase "F" in its name clashes with decades of teaching. But since this approach to capitalization helps our English readers spot the full name immediately, we don't bother using italics.

**Instead of judging which organization is right, we simply follow individual preferences within reason** (i.e., just as in English, we do not use all uppercase or all lowercase letters simply because some group decides it's fashionable). See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for more details on English names versus logos, such as Kazaa instead of "KaZaA" and CBC.ca instead of "cbc.ca." 

**A special note about Le, La, etc.**

**Use the English definite article** ("the") **rather than any French equivalent** (_l', le, la, les_) **unless the French article is part of a formal title** (e.g., book, film, TV program, poem), **or is officially part of the name of a building, business, etc.** (e.g., on a hotel or restaurant sign, on a newspaper masthead). **Include italics when French rather than English capitalization is used.** This helps readers who may otherwise be jarred by the lack of capital letters:

> L'Actualité (a magazine)
>
> L'Auberge du Grand Lac (a hotel)
>
> _la belle province_ (nickname for Quebec)
>
> _la Francophonie_ (acceptable in first reference to _Organisation internationale de la Francophonie_; the group's full name is not required)
>
> La Presse
>
> _Le guide du rédacteur_ (a book)
>
> Le Journal de Montréal
>
> Les Grands Ballets Canadiens
>
> _Le Téléjournal_
>
> Les Terrasses de la Chaudière (a government complex)
>
> the Bloc Québécois
>
> the _Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec_
>
> the Cirque du Soleil
>
> the _Confédération des syndicats nationaux_
>
> the _Office québécois de la langue française_
>
> the Parti Québécois


**General CBC News style governing the use of [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) in the titles of films, television or radio programs, works of art, etc., also apply.** This means that if English text is italicized according to our guidelines, the French equivalent should be as well, regardless of capitalization (e.g., _Quirks & Quarks_ and _Découverte_). We apply English capitalization to Radio-Canada's flagship news and current affairs programs (e.g., _Le Téléjournal_ and _Le Point_ instead of "_Le téléjournal_" and "_Le point_") because of convention. But equally brief program names that don't begin with a French article (e.g., _Zone libre_) retain their original lowercase lettering.

**Check for official or individual preferences.** We use the "Cirque du Soleil" and "Les Grands Ballets Canadiens," for instance, because these are the groups' preferences. The Canadian Press, on the other hand, has traditionally recommended the _Cirque du soleil_ and _les Grands ballets canadiens_.

**The convention of capitalizing the first letter of the article in French newspaper names** (e.g., Le Devoir) **does not apply to English publications** (e.g., the Toronto Star) on CBC.ca. See also general guidelines on [**The versus the**](/home/t/the-versus-the) for English style points (e.g., the Globe and Mail but The National).

**If the French article is lowercase in a title or name, do not use a capital "L"** (e.g. "_La Francophonie_" instead of the correct "_la Francophonie_") **except at the start of sentences.**

**Avoid writing "the _la_" or "the _le_," etc., which is redundant.

Keep in mind that articles are sometimes fused to other words in a name, so always check to make sure a spelling is correct:**

Lac de la Trappe (a lake in Quebec)
Lac Latrape (another lake in Quebec)
Rivière Lafleur (a river in Quebec)
John le Carré (author)
Roméo LeBlanc (former governor general)

See also [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for tips on whether to retain words such as da, de, du, la, etc., in names in second reference (e.g., Charles de Gaulle become "de Gaulle" but Dominique de Villepin becomes "Villepin").


**Abbreviations**

**Widely known abbreviations do not need to be spelled out. Since they feature capital letters, italics are not required:**

-   FLQ (OK in first reference; no need to write the _Front de libération du Québec_)
-   CROP (identify as "a Quebec-based polling firm," **not** the _Centre de recherches sur l'opinion publique_)
-   RDI (identify as the French all-news television service of the CBC, **not** _Réseau de l'information_)

**Abbreviations uncommon outside Quebec should be avoided in national stories whenever possible. But when they're used, provide a description rather than merely spelling out** the original French words:

-   CEGEP ("a Quebec postsecondary education program" for high school graduates preparing for university or who are studying various vocational trades, not _Collège
    d'enseignement général et professionnel_ — which a recent Canadian Press Stylebook wrongly spelled as "_professionel_").
-   CLSC ("a community health centre," not the _Centre local de services communautaires_)

Some French abbreviations that can be pronounced as words feature a blend of upper and lowercase characters, along the lines of the generic English acronyms "radar" and "scuba" (which originally stood for "radio detection and ranging" and "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"). Depending on how theses letters are pronounced, accents may be added by some French writers and editors. Unless such abbreviations (known as _sigles lexicalisés_) are well-established through convention, use capital letters and no accents to flag proper nouns (e.g., our style is "CEGEP" rather than "_Cégep_" or "_cégep_").

**As with English abbreviations, periods are not generally used unless the French letters represent geographical locations.** Both languages' rules can be complex when dealing with, say, [university degrees](/home/d/degrees) that include uppercase and lowercase letters, such as PhD versus B.Ed. For CBC News purposes, however, **the main difference worth noting here is the presence of hyphens in French geographical abbreviations:**


**English**
U.S. (for United States)
P.E.I. (for Prince Edward Island)
RCMP (for Royal Canadian Mounted Police)


**French**
É.-U. (for États-Unis)
Î.-P.-É. (for Île-du-Prince-Édouard)
GRC (for _Gendarmerie royale du Canada_)

We almost invariably report geographical locations in English. But in rare cases when the original French abbreviation appears (e.g., directly transcribed quotes or excerpts from written texts), follow the above guidelines.

For specific guidelines on how to handle political parties in first reference (BQ, ADQ, PQ, etc.), see [Capitalization and italics](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#capitalization) above.


**Translations (overview)**
**Do not bother translating a brief French phrase if its meaning will be obvious to most English-speaking Canadians:**

> "I believe in Canada," Chrétien said as he ended his final speech to the Liberal Party with his trademark rallying cry: "_Vive le Canada_!"


**Avoid publishing lengthy French text.** If you have two comparable quotes from Question Period, for instance, pick the English one. If the French quote is better, use an accurate English translation flagged as such.

**If you're not skilled at translating French and if you don't have a good understanding of acceptable English versions of French idioms, do not guess. Check a reliable source or leave this information out of the story** until an accurate and meaningful translation can be obtained.

**Don't over-emphasize translation.** It's unnecessary to remind readers that someone spoke in French, as long as this is established once, early on, for readers:

> "I didn't ask any questions," Brault testified in French. "It was never mentioned to me that there would be IOUs attached to these contracts."


**Even in cases when several different French speakers are quoted, a single reference to all the material being translated is sufficient.** For instance, if readers are told that a court case was heard in French or that a political leaders' debate was held in French, it's unnecessary to mention this fact again.

But just because comments appear on, say, Radio-Canada doesn't mean the people interviewed spoke in French, particularly if their first language is English. So additional clarification is needed:

> "I think I will never be truly free, because there are different kinds of prisons. There are concrete prisons, and there are internal prisons," Homolka told Radio-Canada, the CBC's French language service.
>
> "I think I will always be in an internal prison," she added. The exclusive interview was conducted entirely in French only hours after Homolka finished serving her 12-year sentence for manslaughter.


**It's generally unnecessary to provide the source of brief translations in news stories** unless there's some concern that the interpretation could be challenged (e.g., in coverage of a legal dispute over contract language). **But when publishing lengthy excerpts from books, magazines, radio or television interviews, etc., identify the source of the English wording whenever possible** (e.g., "The translation was provided by CBC Montreal"). In the case of sizable projects (e.g., transcribing and translating the entire 13-minute Karla Homolka interview cited above), individual credit can be given if the translators are known to us if they request their names be used.

**English punctuation**
**Always use English punctuation, even if large chunks of French text from a document are posted verbatim on CBCNews.ca.**

For instance, **type inverted commas** (_"D'après moi, le bilinguisme est irréversible au Canada"_) **rather than guillemets or chevrons** (_«D'après moi, le bilinguisme est irréversible au Canada»_) around direct quotes, **and use periods rather than commas in numerical references** (3.75% not "3,75 %").

**The same rule applies to people's names.** The spelled-out form should include accents and hyphens when applicable (e.g., Marie-Josée Bédard and Félix-Adrien Gauthier), because these are standard in both languages. But **the abbreviated form should use English punctuation** (i.e., periods only), as in Quebec Justice M.J. Bédard and the Quebec ferry F.A. Gauthier, **rather than French punctuation** (i.e., hyphens with periods), as in "M.-J. Bédard" or "F.-A. Gauthier").

The only exception is when an entire original document (e.g., presented as a PDF) is posted to allow our bilingual readers to compare the wording with an English translation. In these rare cases, the original French (including punctuation) will obviously be left intact.

**Transcribed French should be in italics. Accurate translations falling within direct quotes should be in square, not curved, brackets** so these words are not misread as a speaker's parenthetical comments in another language. **Unless including the original French helps the story, prefer an accurate English translation to maintain smoother-flowing copy:**


**Correct but awkward**

> "It's true in Ontario, et _c'est la même chose au Québec_" \[and it's the same thing in Quebec\]," the prime minister said.

**Shorter and preferable**

> "It's true in Ontario," the prime minister said. "And it's the same thing in Quebec," he quickly added in French.


**Always use proper capitalization and accents from a reliable source when posting the original French.** Otherwise, stick to an accurate English translation or paraphrase, identified as such.

**Other types of translations, such as book or movie titles, can be in regular brackets.** Newspapers, news programs, etc., do not require translations:


> _Le cœur de la baleine bleue_ (_The Heart of the Blue Whale_)
>
> Le Devoir (newspaper title; **no** italics; do **not** translate)
>
> _L'Éclusier_ (_Lock-keeper_)
>
> _Zone libre_ (do **not** translate as "_Free Zone_"; instead, simply identify it as a documentary program on Radio-Canada, the CBC's French language service)


But see [Titles](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#titles) and [French idioms](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#idioms) below for caveats about translating even brief phrases, including the wording found in book and film titles.


**Titles**

**Use the English versions of titles (films, books, etc.) alone if they're well-known** (e.g., _The Little Prince_, not _Le petit prince_). **Use the French versions of titles alone, with no translation, if this is how the works are known in English.** In these cases, use English capitalization if the initial uppercase lettering on principal words has been established by convention (e.g., _La Bohème_ not _La bohème_).

**Otherwise, use the original French title first with an English translation or description in parentheses.** Keep in mind that French and English titles frequently feature different wording for artistic or cultural reasons:

> _Bonheur d'occasion_ ("second-hand happiness" in French, but published in English as _The Tin Flute_)
>
> _La détresse et l'enchantement_ (_Enchantment and Sorrow_)
>
> _La vie en rose_ (**no** English translation necessary)
>
> _Les feuilles mortes_ ("dead leaves" in French, but the song was recorded in English as _Autumn Leaves_)
>
> _Les Misérables_ (**no** English translation necessary; use English capitalization)
>
> _Jesus of Montreal_ (English title sufficient; **not** _Jésus de Montréal_)
>
> _Mon oncle Antoine_ (_My Uncle Antoine_)
>
> _Sur le seuil_ ("on the threshold" in French, but called _Evil Words_ in English)
>
> _The Decline of the American Empire_ (English title sufficient; **not** _Le déclin de l'empire américain_)


**Check for official translations when dealing with even seemingly straightforward wording.** For instance, _La moitié gauche du frigo_ (which literally means _The Left Half of the Fridge_) was called "_The Left Side of the Fridge_" by the New York Times and "_The Left Half of the Fridge_" by Playback magazine. But the Canadian Film Encyclopedia lists the English title of this 2000 movie by Philippe Falardeau as "_The Left-Hand Side of the Fridge,_" which is CBC News style. And the 1979 novel _Le sourd dans la ville_ is officially translated as _Deaf to the City_ rather than as "the deaf person in the city."

**Provide context to translations if it enhances the story.** Although the novel _Un habit de lumière_ was published in English with a literally translated title (_A Suit of Light_), for instance, many of our readers won't know that this French phrase actually means a bullfighter's costume unless we supply the background.

And instead of merely noting that the biography _Jacques Demers en toutes lettres_ roughly translates as _Jacques Demers From A to Z_ we should make it clear that the title reflects the book's startling revelation that the former NHL coach spent his career hiding his inability to read or write. (Note: When the book was launched in Quebec in November 2005, the publisher was still debating whether to issue an English version. In the meantime, other unofficial translations of the title offered by English media included "Jacques Demers All Spelled Out.")

So in a feature on, say, René Lévesque, it would be fine to briefly mention his involvement in a broadcast programs such as Point de mire with no translation in brackets. (The well-known current affairs program _Point de mire_, which roughly means "focus of attention," would be treated like a newspaper name and retain its French wording.) But when mentioning Lévesque's biography, _Attendez que je me rappelle_ ("Wait while I recall that"), we would better serve our readers by adding some context — reporting that the book was published in English as _Memoirs_ while also pointing out the faint echo of Quebec's official motto, _Je me souviens_ ("I remember"), in the original title.

**French idioms**
**Translations of sentence fragments are unnecessary if the short French expression is relatively common and the meaning is already clear because of context.** For instance, if someone refers to a _cause célèbre_ in a clip you're transcribing from a TV interview, there's no point adding the literal meaning ("famous cause") in brackets. Readers can always consult an English dictionary, just as they might look up a polysyllabic word such as "superfluous" if it's not part of their vocabulary.

**Literal translations are frequently insufficient, even for sentence fragments.** Although bon means "good" and _mot_ means "word," when placed next to each other they convey the meaning "witty remark." The expression is so common in English, of course, that italics are not required, let alone a definition. But "bon mot" is an example of how a literal translation ("good word") would fail to do its job.

**For more obscure idioms** (e.g., _trouver chaussure à son pied_), **a better option is to describe the meaning of the original French in an English paraphrase** instead of bothering with a literal translation ("to find a shoe that fits"):

> Near the end of his life the novelist was very lonely, she said. "He eventually gave up the search for _chaussure à son pied_," a French expression that means finding a suitable match. "He resigned himself to the companionship of whisky and books."


Another example would be the old Quebec TV program _Entre chien et loup_. Our readers learn little if we simply translate it as "between dog and wolf" without telling them that the expression means "at twilight" (when it's hard to tell between one thing and another). But as with many expressions, even this seemingly straightforward translation might be misleading if _entre chien et loup_ is being used in a different context (e.g., it could also suggest a measure of fear in the uncertainty between the comfortable and the potentially dangerous unknown).

**Use English conventions in certain translations of names**
Problems can arise even when literal translations are applied to organizations' names. **If similar groups or government agencies are common in other provinces, prefer English translations that follow established patterns used across Canada:**

-   Quebec College of Physicians

    -   not _Ordre des médecins du Québec_

    -   not "the Order of Quebec Doctors"
-   Quebec health insurance

    -   not _d'assurance maladie du Québec_

    -   not "Quebec sickness insurance"

See also [Quebec Bar](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#bar) rather than "Quebec Bar Association" above for related guidelines

This applies to a wide range of other French terms as well, such as:

> chief electoral officer

> > **not** _directeur général des élections_
>
> > **not** "director of the election"

> manslaughter

> > **not** _homicide involontaire_
>
> > **not** "involuntary homicide"

> president and CEO

> > **not** _président-directeur général_
>
> > **not** "president and director general"


**Use common sense when translating.** While _président-directeur général_ makes sense as "president and CEO" of a company, _directeur général_ doesn't work well as "CEO" if applied to, say, the head of a union. A title such as "executive director" is better, instead.

**And watch out for words in French that look like their English counterpart but actually have different meanings**, such as: _déception_ (disappointment), _exploiter_ (operate), _formation_ (training, in certain contexts) and _nomination_ (appointment).


**Verifying spellings and accents**

**Our primary reference book for commonly used French words in English is the [Canadian Oxford Dictionary](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfordreference.com%2Fviews%2FBOOK_SEARCH.html%3Fbook%3Dt150%26subject%3Ds7&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2OKFN4tVZvBoLEWW60f-h9)** — e.g., chargé d'affaires (no italics) but _coup d'état_ (italics, and _d'é_ **not** _d'É_), resumé not résumé, and protege not protégé.

**In the case of proper nouns** (the names of people, place, organizations, etc.), **do not guess simply to meet a deadline**.
**Add accents to French words only if these are known to be accurate.** Just as we're expected to take the trouble to check an English spelling (Cariboo Mountains in B.C. versus Caribou Mountains in Alberta), we must make the effort to use accents consistently and accurately.

When handling breaking news, **post urgent stories without accents (or without the French names in question, if these are unessential to the story)**. But be sure to add the correct accents as soon as reasonably possible.

**Good sources for checking the spellings of, and accents in, French names include:**

There's a small fee for every request, so you'll need your supervisor's permission (and a budget number) to use this service. CBC News staff can also check the websites of [Le Devoir](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ledevoir.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1YzMe8eZrsjWAYowdKeAcA) and [La Presse](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lapresse.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2MHAGepDAtVfB4ESDkfvzI), although the amount of free content is substantially less than what's available through Eureka. If you go this route, Radio-Canada.ca journalists suggest trying Le Devoir first.

In the case of unknown or low-profile people featured in CBC Radio or CBC-TV reports, **another option is to contact broadcast journalists working on these stories** to see if they know the correct spellings, including accents. **But do not rely solely on radio or television scripts, which are not intended for publication.
**
As mentioned in the section on [people's names](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#names) above, **when two different spellings are offered by sources that seem equally reliable, flag the clash and request a ruling.**

The best source, of course, is the actual person featured in a story. When CBC News employees interview anyone, correct spellings of names should be verified at this stage.

### ful versus fuls

**\-ful and -fuls**

If you write about **more than one handful, cupful, spoonful**, etc. **put the “s” at the end.**

_Three **spoonfuls** of lemon juice_ (not spoonsful or spoons full).

_Two **cupfuls** of flour_ (not cupsful or cups full).

_A few **handfuls** of popcorn_ (not handsful or hands full).

**But** _“I have my **hands full** at the moment.”_

Replacing perfectly acceptable words like “tablespoonfuls” with “tablespoons full” can be a recipe for disaster. Grammarian Theodore Bernstein cites the following example:

(WRONG) _“Now throw in two tablespoons full of chopped parsley and cook 10 minutes more. The quail ought to be tender by then.”_

As Bernstein quips, “Never mind the quail; how are we ever going to get those tablespoons tender?”

### fundamentalist extremist

**Fundamentalist, extremist, militant, rebel, etc.**


**Avoid overly broad brush strokes in stories involving _militant fundamentalism_.** While it may be relevant to point out that an Islamic extremist is behind an attack, or that a Christian extremist is advocating a violent response to a bombing, we should **never suggest that militants represent the teachings or beliefs of an entire faith** (i.e., that all followers of [Islam](/home/i/islam), Christianity, Judaism, etc., advocate violence). We should also **never imply that someone who is a fundamentalist or a separatist is automatically a _militant_.**

**While it's generally best to [prefer details over labels](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#details), here are some guidelines on potentially controversial words** that sometimes appear in news stories:











**Anarchist**
Chaos and anarchy are sometimes confused. Chaos means utter disorder. Anarchy means a type of societal order without government. **An anarchist promotes living without government. While anarchy, itself, does not mean militancy, the term has this strong connotation** — despite the writings and teachings of peaceful anarchists. Attacks against a government should not automatically be considered acts of anarchy. The motivation of the assailants is relevant. If some people want to overthrow the government with their own regime, for instance, they are rebels, militants, etc., not anarchists.


**Extremist**
In a religious context, the word **extremist suggests a zealot or fanatic engaged in some type of "holy war."** This person is not merely an advocate of a strict interpretation of a doctrine. The individual is also prepared to go to extreme measures (including violence) in a campaign to promote this religious belief. Historically, the Crusades are an example of extreme Christian fundamentalism. Since extremists are not limited to a particular faith, it is important in stories to provide as much background as possible to put stories in context (e.g., a Christian extremist or an Islamic extremist). The term extreme fundamentalist is acceptable and generally suggests a [militant](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#militant).


**Fundamentalist**
Be cautious when using the word fundamentalist to describe religious beliefs. The word simply describes a person **who subscribes to** (and generally, but not always, advocates) **what is perceived to be the literal truth of a given religion's holy writings. Fundamentalism alone does not mean militancy.** Millions of law-abiding citizens of many different faiths in all corners of the globe fall into the category of fundamentalists. Far fewer are [extreme fundamentalists](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#extremist) or [militant fundamentalists](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#militant).


**Guerrilla versus non-combatant**
Government forces sometimes clash with the country's own citizens. **Unarmed civilians should be described as such**. Another term is **non-combatant**. By contrast, **armed and organized citizens who attack the police or the military** are conventionally described as **rebels or guerrillas**. These are neutral terms to describe fighters waging a campaign against a given regime. They are generally trying to oust a leader, overthrow a government or break away from a country (in which case they are **armed separatists**).


**Insurgent**
See [rebel](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#rebel) below


**Islamist**
See [Islamicist versus Islamist](/home/i/islam#islamicist)


**Militant**
**Militants are prepared to use violence to carry out a campaign**, which may or may not be based in religion. While it's conventional and acceptable to use the words extremist and militant synonymously to describe violent [fundamentalists](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#fundamentalist), it's important to remember that **militancy always involves force** while **extremism and fanaticism simply imply it**. The term "extreme militant" is redundant. A militant, by definition, is prepared to go to extreme lengths. The term **militant fundamentalist**, on the other hand, is acceptable when framing militancy in the context of fundamental religious beliefs.


**Radical**
**The terms radical and radicalism are rooted in fundamentalism.** They are synonyms for [extremist](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#extremist) and extremism (i.e., implying that individuals are prepared to go to extreme measures, including violence, to wage a particular campaign).


**Rebel**
**The word rebel is tied to rebellion.** It generally describes people who have taken up arms against a government in power, from isolated unrest to widespread civil war. Organized rebels are often called **anti-government forces, insurgents, opposition fighters**, etc. If they gain control over most of a country, **the term rebel is conventionally dropped once an interim or transitional government is established.** Since it's often difficult to gauge whether the tide of war has shifted in a given conflict, we rely heavily on CBC foreign correspondents for informed assessments whenever possible. (See also [guerrilla versus non-combatant](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#guerrilla))


**Separatist**
**The word accurately describes anyone who openly supports establishing an autonomous country or territory** (e.g., Chechen separatists, Kurdish separatists). But being a secessionist does not automatically mean backing militancy. **Avoid stating or implying that all separatists are advocates of violence. Use qualifying language** (e.g., extreme separatists, radical separatists, militant separatists) **to distinguish rebels from non-violent separatists.** Another option is to specify membership in a given group or movement (e.g., [Khalistani extremists)](/home/k#Khalistani), defining and/or explaining any comparatively obscure proper nouns as required.


**Prefer details over labels**
When reporting on violent attacks, **specific information is often more helpful to our audience than broad labels alone**, if details of particular allegations or confirmed actions are known. Words such as **bomber, gunman, sniper, etc.**, convey more information than, say, terms like extremist or militant repeated throughout a story.

### funerals

**Funerals**

Funerals are solemn events. All relevant CBC journalistic standards and practice apply, including general principles about respecting individual privacy while reporting on matters of public interest.

**Prefer simple language** (e.g., **funeral director** or **undertaker** instead of mortician, and **bury** instead of inter). **To help keep the wording of stories accurate and consistent, here are brief reminders about a few terms** that have caused occasional confusion over the years:







[funeral](/home/f/funerals#general) (general)

[inter, interment](/home/f/funerals#interment) (never "internment")


[military funeral](/home/f/funerals#militaryfuneral) (gun carriage, firing party, etc.)
[national funeral](/home/f/funerals#nationalfuneral) (Quebec)




**book of condolence** — The entrenched term is singular (condolence) because the word is synonymous with sympathy in this context (e.g., a message of condolence, a letter of condolence, a book of condolence). It's parallel to, say, a book of prayer that contains many different prayers. While the alternative form "condolences" is sometimes used, prefer the original construction "book of condolence" for consistency. The plural is **books of condolence** (e.g., when messages are compiled in different locations).

**bury** — A common and acceptable verb to describe placing a body (or remains) in a final, enclosed resting place. Burials do not literally need to be underground (e.g., a burial at sea, a burial in a tomb). This expanded sense of the word, established over the centuries, is why **the Oxford English Dictionary lists "inter" as one definition of "bury."** Be aware that we get occasional audience complaints from people who do not embrace this usage, including in coverage of the 2021 funeral of Prince Philip. It's worth noting, however, that Windsor Castle, itself, uses the expression "[royal burials in the chapel](https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/royal-burials/royal-burials-chapel-location/)" going all the way back to Henry VIII half a millennium ago.

**casket** — Acceptable as a synonym for [coffin](/home/f/funerals#coffin). Usually made of wood. Can be highly ornate. Commonly used in the compounds open casket and closed casket (e.g., it was an **open-casket viewing**, it was a **closed-casket service**, they approached the **closed casket**).

**coffin** — A rectangular box in which a corpse is either buried or cremated. Usually made of wood. The word coffin is preferred by some writers and editors because it's considered more conversational than [casket](/home/f/funerals#casket). But the latter is very common in North America, especially in the compounds open casket and closed casket.

**cortège** — Generally prefer the simpler term **funeral procession** in English news reporting. But if you use cortège, include the accent (see [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) in English journalism).

**die of** — Use "die of" not "die from" for specific illnesses or conditions (e.g., "She died of cancer" and "He died of hypothermia").

**flypast, flyby** (lowercase, no hyphens) — Either word is correct. If an aircraft is missing (or deliberately peels away) during the flypast, prefer **missing plane formation** or **missing member formation** over "missing man" formation. (See also [military funeral](/home/f/funerals#militaryfuneral) for related language)

**funeral** — May or may not be religious (e.g., specific ritual, readings from scripture). In North America, often conducted in a church, temple or chapel. Can be **public** or **private**. The **body or ashes are usually present**. The casket may be open or closed, depending on the family's wishes. In many cases, a **private viewing** or **visitation** may have been held ahead of time at a different location. Even in the case of public funerals, the actual **burial service** (also called a **graveside service**) afterward may be restricted to immediate family and friends. (See also [memorial service](/home/f/funerals#memorialservice), [military funeral](/home/f/funerals#militaryfuneral) and [state funeral](/home/f/funerals#statefuneral))

**half-mast** — The preferred Canadian terminology for flags lowered to honour the dead. (See [half-mast versus half-staff](/home/h/half-mast))

**inter, interment** — Generally prefer the simpler words [**bury** and **burial**](#bury). At all costs, avoid using the completely different word "internment" (which means imprisonment or forcible confinement).

**lie in state** — Normally associated with state funerals. The remains of the deceased are placed on view to allow large numbers of people to pay their final respects. Depending on protocol, there may be an honour guard. The casket is often inside a public building, such as the Centre Block of Parliament Hill. Present tense: "She **lies in state**." Present participle: "She is **lying in state**." Future: "He **will lie in state** until Friday." Past tense: "He **lay in state** until Friday." The past participle: "People who **have lain in state** include a number of former premiers and prime ministers." ALWAYS WRONG: "laying" and "laid" when referring to a dead body. (See also [lay versus lie](/home/l/lay-versus-lie)) The verbal phrase has no hyphens (e.g., "She will lie in state for four days"). But the noun and adjectival forms take punctuation (e.g., "The lying-in-state began on Thursday"). In Canada, a **lying-in-state vigil** often lasts several days. The exact duration varies. In rare cases, the expression "permanently lie in state" is used in some countries to describe government leaders whose embalmed bodies are displayed in special shrines, museums, mausoleums, etc., year-round (e.g., Vladimir Lenin in Russia and Mao Zedong in China). **Be aware that some people differentiate between "lying in state"** (usually at a major government or "state" building) **and "lying in repose"** (at some other location). However, such distinctions are rarely made outside bureaucratic and diplomatic protocol circles now. Furthermore, it's become an acceptable convention in Canada to refer to high-profile figures, such as sports legends, "lying in state" before public ceremonies tied to special honours, such as what's called a [national funeral](#nationalfuneral) in Quebec.

**memorial service** — Usually held **without the body or ashes present** because the actual funeral was a private service or because the remains have already been buried. (See also [funeral](/home/f/funerals#general))

**military funeral** — In Canada, the Defence Department is in charge of military funeral protocol, including who is eligible. A **gun carriage** refers to a towed artillery weapon with the casket secured on top. The **bearer party** carries the casket. The **firing party** conducts any ceremonial discharge of weapons (volleys) at the graveside. Wreaths are **laid** or **placed**. Flags fly at [half-mast](/home/f/funerals#halfmast). Planes roaring overhead in a specific formation can be called either a [flypast](#flypast) or a flyby. Trumpets are sounded. Bugles are blown or sounded. Guard against calling the **[_Last Post_](/home/l/last-post)** something else (e.g., "_Taps_").

**national funeral** (Quebec) — Has **specific meaning in Quebec**. Similar to a [state funeral](/home/f/funerals#statefuneral) but with **less elaborate protocol**. Only former (or sitting) premiers and certain other former or sitting members of the National Assembly are granted full state funerals by the province. The term "national funeral" is used for virtually all other prominent citizens. Details can be found on the [government's funeral protocol page](https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/protocol/state-ceremonial-funerals). National funerals are not a type of state funeral in Quebec but, rather, are simply a different type of official funeral. Therefore, **it's inaccurate to call national funerals in Quebec "state funerals."** On the other hand, people outside the province may be confused by use of the term "national" without context. Therefore, if the detail is included in stories it's usually best to frame it as a provincial term with brief background or a some form of attribution (e.g., Montreal Canadiens legend Jean Béliveau was given "what's known as a national funeral in Quebec" or "what the province calls a national funeral" or even, simply, Jean Béliveau "was given a Quebec national funeral"). When public visitation honours are scheduled, it's an acceptable convention to use the expression "[lying in state](#lieinstate)" or "lying in repose" in such cases.

**peal versus peel** — Bells peal (are sounded), although the comparatively more sombre verb **toll** is usually recommended for funerals. Planes peel (break or roll away) from aerial formation during special [flypasts](/home/f/funerals#flypast).

**state funeral** — A special honour generally given to former prime ministers, premiers, presidents and other government leaders, as well as certain esteemed or popular citizens. Protocols vary from country to country. In Canada, state funerals can be offered by the federal government as well as by provincial and territorial governments. The Canadian Heritage Department has compiled answers to [**FAQs about states funerals in Canada**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fservices%2Fculture%2Fevents-celebrations-commemorations%2Fcommemorations%2Fstate-funerals.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0KYLLGi8CZ0pYDcEk-JXyP). Be aware that the terms state funeral and national funeral are different in Quebec (See [national funeral](/home/f/funerals#nationalfuneral)).

**the late** — Acceptable term to describe someone who recently died (e.g., the late Jane Smith, son of the late Jane Smith). But avoid when referring to people who have been dead for years (e.g., writing "the late" Terry Fox is considered as odd and as unnecessary as writing "the late" John A. Macdonald or "the late" Charles Dickens). While misuse of "the late" is rarely an issue at funerals, it can surface in coverage of special memorials, such as the official reburying of the remains of a soldier many decades after a war. (See also [former versus the late](/home/l#thelate))

**widow** (wife of dead spouse), **widower** (husband of dead spouse) — Avoid redundancies (e.g., write "wife of the late" or "widow of" but not "widow of the late" since the word widow already implies that the spouse is dead).

See also [death reporting guidelines](/home/d/death-general-guidelines) for related tips (e.g., generally prefer direct language such as "died" over euphemisms such as "passed away")

**G** 

**[g-gg](/home/g#g)**

**[gh-gq](/home/g#gh)**

**[gr-gz](/home/g#gr)**

**g-gg**
**G7, G8, G20** (no hyphens); **Group of Seven, Group of Eight, Group of 20**; See [**G8 and G20**](/home/g/g8-g20-2010-summits) for a general overview, as well as for specific spellings and pronunciations of participants in the 2010 G8 and G20 summits in Canada. Although a comma is fine (**G8, G20 summits**), a slash is acceptable and easier to scan (G8/G20 summits), especially in graphics and web headlines. Do _not_ use a hyphen, which suggests a joint meeting (i.e., avoid "G8-G20"); **G7 countries, G8 leaders, G20 finance ministers**, etc.

**gadfly** (Someone who is irritating. It does not mean a social butterfly or gadabout.)

****gadget, gadgetry****

**Gadhafi, Moammar** (For consistency, use this entrenched [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations). Variations to avoid include an "h" in Moammar and Gadhafi with a "Q") He became the leader of Libya during a military coup in 1969. Use the spelling **Seif al-Islam Gadhafi** for his second son. A CBCNews.ca profile includes background on [other family members](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fstory%2F2011%2F02%2F22%2Ff-gadhafi-family.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1y9iDbRSxpyosR9LNKPbnH).

**gaffe** (mistake); **gaff** (type of spar in sailing; also a pole with hook for landing fish)

****gaiety****

**gale** (See [weather words](/home/w/weather-words#windspeed))

**Gallup poll**

**Gambia** (country in West Africa) Common and acceptable name for **the Republic of The Gambia** throughout stories. Generally prefer Gambia over "The Gambia," although adding "The" is not actually wrong. See [country names](/home/g/geography-cities) for general guidelines on shortening geographical proper nouns

**Game Boy** (video game)
**
GameCube** (one word)

**Games, the** (acceptable second reference for the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, etc.) See also [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games)

**Gandhi** (_not_ Ghandi)

****gardener****

**garnishee** (v.) Recovering money through specific legal means. The act is known as **garnishment** (n.) _The judge agreed to **garnishee** his wages. The company **garnishees** a percentage of her paycheques. They **garnisheed** the entire debt._ Although "garnish" is also a verb, prefer the spelling garnishee for subtractions and garnish for embellishments or additions (e.g., adorning plates of food).

**Gastown** (in downtown Vancouver)

**Gatineau, Que.** (formerly Hull) Not everyone in Canada knows where Gatineau is. So in stories it's helpful to mention that the city is across the river from Ottawa. But when writing about events in Gatineau, do not refer to the location as "Ottawa." They're not only separate communities, they're in different provinces.

*gauge****

**gay** (see [2SLGBTQ+](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/ "2SLGBTQ+"))

**gauntlet** (_not_ gantlet)

**[Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip)**

**Gazan** (resident of the [Gaza Strip](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/middle-east-glossary/#gazastrip "Middle East glossary"); plural is **Gazans**) Generally **prefer Palestinian, Palestinian in Gaza, etc., in first reference**. When accurate, the term **Gazan is increasingly common and acceptable in periodic second reference** or in the occasional web headline where space is tight. The demonym is no different from countless other nouns that provide precise geographical detail — e.g., Albertan, Quebecer, Torontonian, Winnipegger, Maritimer, Floridian, Crimean, Egyptian, Qatari and Muscovite. Be aware that the word Gazan is used neutrally by various international organizations, including the United Nations and Amnesty International. **Avoid Gazan as a generic synonym for the much broader word Palestinian.** The former refers to people living in the Gaza Strip while the latter refers to people of Palestinian heritage who could be anywhere in the world, including the West Bank.

**gee** (surprise); **geez** (mild oath) For consistency, prefer this spelling over alternatives, including "jeez"

****gefilte fish****

**geiger counter** (lowercase)

**gender** (in grammar: masculine, feminine and neuter; in society: male, female identity, which may or may not match one's biological classification) Some people object to using the word gender to describe male or female characteristics outside of the realm of grammar. The term is common and acceptable in certain descriptions of cultural and societal differences between men and women. Labels include the nouns **gender bias, gender gap, gender role**, and the adjectives **gender-neutral** and **gender-specific**. But when reporting on anatomical, biological or genetic differences, the term gender can be problematic. It ignores the reality of "gender identity." It can also sound prudishly euphemistic. More direct language, such as **sex** or the sexes, is often better. Be aware that using "gender" instead of "sex" can cause confusion and be challenged as inaccurate, in some contexts. (See [**gender vs. sex**](/home/t/transgender#sex-gender) for details.)

**general (Gen.)** See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**genetically modified, genetically modified food** (_avoid_ abbreviation GM, such as "GM food"); **genetically modified organism** (no hyphen) The terms **GMO** and **GMOs** (plural) are OK in headlines and in second reference in stories.

**Geneva** (not "Genève," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Geneva Conventions** (almost always plural) Use the singular form only when referring to one of the four international treaties, such as "the Second Geneva Convention." See also [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview).

**gigabyte, gigabytes** (**GB** _not_ "Gbyte") GB is a metric symbol that's both singular and plural, along the lines of km, so it's **1 GB, 250 GB**, etc. Since the term has become common, no definition is required in first reference. Note: Technically, there are 1,024 MB in 1 GB. But in general news stories, it's OK to consider 1 GB as roughly 1,000 MB. (See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout) for more guidelines on symbols that look like abbreviations)

**gigahertz (GHz)** If used, include an explanation: one billion cycles a second.

****gigolo, gigolos*

*gillnet, gillnetter*

*girlfriend, boyfriend*

*[Girl Guides](/home/g/girl-guides)****

**GIS** (OK in headlines, but spell out as **geographic information system** once in first reference); see also [guaranteed income supplement](/home/g#guaranteedincomesupplement) below

**Gitxsan-Wet'suwet'en** (_not_ "Gitksan") B.C. [First Nations](/home/i/Indigenous) name

**Giuseppe** (Italian for Joseph)

**GivingTuesday** (U.S.-based non-profit group) Keep the proper noun fused when referring to the organization, as well as to the **#GivingTuesday** benevolence campaign that started in New York City in 2012 and then spread with support from partners like the United Nations Foundation. But include a space in **Giving Tuesday** when referring to the specific date in late November, to plural constructions (**Giving Tuesdays**), as well as to the global **Giving Tuesday movement**. Be aware that in the spring of 2023, Associated Press started reporting the date of Giving Tuesday as "GivingTuesday," which is why it's sometimes rendered that way on the wires. But that's an jarringly inconsistent approach to how we and most major English news organizations handle [special days](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/holidays/ "Holidays"), from religious (Good Friday) to commercial (Cyber Monday).

****gizmo, gizmos*

*gladiolus, gladioli****

**glamour** (but **glamorous** with a "u" in a different spot, and **glamorize** with no "u")

**glasnost** ([no italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics))

**globalization** (to make global) The term, coined in the 1930s, originally referred to existing or influencing on a worldwide scale in the broadest sense. For more than half a century, globalization has more narrowly applied to business and investment. It normally implies an increase in free trade and open markets. Proponents say globalization boosts economic efficiency, growth and overall wealth. Critics say it erodes national identity and the ability of countries to protect certain industries, public policy goals, etc. Globalism commonly means the pursuit of economic or political goals based on international rather than on national or local values and principles. The terms **globalism** and **globalist** are conventionally synonymous with globalization because they emphasize business connections across borders and between continents. Words such as globalism, globalist, globalization and **anti-globalization** do not normally need to be defined in news stories as long as the context makes their meanings clear. The terms are generally considered neutral descriptions of political and economic ideology. But be aware that some fringe groups use the words globalism, globalist and globalization in xenophobic or racist ways. In rare cases when this applies, the pejorative meaning should be attributed and explained to give our audience the full picture.

**Global North, Global South** (initial caps) Shorthand for wealthy, developed countries, primarily in the **Northern Hemisphere**, and less wealthy, less developed countries, primarily in the **Southern Hemisphere**. The geographical divide is not exact, however, since Australia and New Zealand are included in the Global North. For consistency, avoid all lowercase ("global north") or mixed case ("global South"), which are both harder to scan and relatively difficult to justify, especially given the conventional capitalization of countless [nicknames](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/n/nicknames/ "Nicknames"), from the Deep South to the Red Planet. (See also [North, South, East, West](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/n/north-south-east-and-west/ "North south east and west") for related guidelines)

**global positioning system** (lowercase) **GPS** is fine in second reference

**global warming** (See [climate change versus global warming](/home/c/climate-change))

**Globe and Mail, the** (not The) See [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the)

****godchild, godfather, godmother, godson, goddaughter****

**God damn, God damned** (_not_ goddam) Use with editorial care

**godforsaken** (desolate); **Godforsaken** (rare, reserve for religious meaning)

****godsend, godless****

**Goebbels, Joseph** (_not_ Göbbels) See [umlauts](/home/g/german-names)

**gofer** (person who runs errands); **gopher** (animal)

**gold rush** (generic) but **Klondike Gold Rush** (see [historical periods](/home/h/historical-periods))

**gospel singer, the gospel truth, but the Gospels, the Four Gospels, the Gospel of St. Matthew, the Gospel of St. Luke, the Gospel of St. Mark, the Gospel of St. John,** etc.

**Goth** (Germanic tribe) but **goth** (subculture); **Gothic** (architectural style) _but_ a **gothic novel** (lowercase by convention)

**GO Transit, GO train** (stands for "Government of Ontario," but do not spell out proper noun) See also "government" lowercase below, as in generic phrases such as "government of Ontario"

**government** (lowercase), as in government of Canada, the Alberta government, etc. For various guidelines on government bodies (the Commons versus a legislature) see [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies)

**governor, Montana's governor, Gov.** Ralph Rug, former governor Ralph Rug, **Bank of Canada governor** Dan Westell (See [titles](/home/t/titles))

[**Governor General** versus **governor general**](/home/g/governor-general) (includes guidelines on abbreviating title to **Gov. Gen.** before the full name, limiting use of **GG** to headlines, etc.)

**GPS** (OK in headlines, but spell out as **global positioning system** once in first reference)

**[g-gg](/home/g#g) \- [gh-gq](/home/g#gh) - [gr-gz](/home/g#gr) \- [bottom](/home/g#bottom)**

**gr-gz**

**Grade 4**, but **fourth grade** (See [numbers](/home/n/numbers))

**graffiti** (plural) _Avoid the singular graffito_, which is normally restricted to stories about drawings at archaeological sites. If you're referring to only one spot (e.g., on a wall or a subway car) write "a work" of graffiti, "a piece" of graffiti, etc.

**grain grower, grain handler, [grain names](/home/g/grain)** (when to use capital letters)

**Grammy, Grammys** (record awards)

**Granada** (Spanish city), **Grenada** (island in the Caribbean)
****
Grand Canyon****

**granddaughter, great-granddaughter**

**grandfather clause, grandfathering** (AVOID) Coined in the 1890s to mean a "special legal exemption," this use of "grandfather" is now considered outmoded and offensive by many, not only because of its sexist overtone but also because of its racist roots. "Grandfather clause" originally meant special provisions that allowed white Americans to continue to vote even if they couldn't meet new suffrage conditions imposed on Black people after the U.S. Civil War (e.g., new literary tests, poll taxes). Acceptable alternatives include **special provision, continued exemption, ongoing exception**, and a contract's **historical clause**.

**grand jury**

**grandmaster** (bridge and chess)

**grandparents, great-grandparents**

**grand slam** (n.), **grand-slam home run** (adj.) See [baseball](/home/b/baseball) terms. But **Grand Slam** (n. and adj.) in tennis stories (Grand Slam event, Grand Slam tournament, etc.)

**Grands Ballets Canadiens, Les** (no need to add "de Montréal" at the end) Second reference: **Les Grands** or the **ballet company**. Use English capitalization (i.e., Les, Ballet and Canadiens all with initial uppercase letters) because of convention. For detailed guidelines, see [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents).

**grassroots** (one word )

**Greater Toronto Area** (**GTA** in second reference, although try to limit use of abbreviation in national stories. Prefer "Toronto and nearby communities," etc.)

**great-grandfather, great-grandmother**
**
the Great Lakes; the Lakes** (all of them) But use a lowercase "l" when referring to a specific lake in second reference (e.g., "**the lake**" for Huron), or to only a few of the lakes at one time (e.g., "**lakes Ontario and Superior**") See also [Lakes versus lakes](/home/l/lakes) and [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

**"great replacement" conspiracy theory** (requires caution) Do not use capital letters. Flag with quotation marks as well as a modifier such as conspiracy to stress its baselessness. Another option is to include the term [so-called](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/so-called/ "So called") before the quotation marks (i.e., **so-called "great replacement" theory**). Limit use in web headlines or TV banners because key context can be lost. All stories that refer to the "great replacement" conspiracy theory should succinctly explain that its origins are found in old [white nationalist](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/w/#white_nationalism "W") fearmongering about a plot to diminish the influence of white people.

**greenbelt** (generic) an area of fields, forests, wetlands, and other green space around a community where development is either prohibited or severely restricted; **Greenbelt** (the name of specific, protected land that's become a proper noun through widespread usage). To ensure accuracy and clarity, be precise when reporting on different greenbelts that could be confused by some in our audience. For instance, **Ontario's Greenbelt** refers to provincially controlled and protected land, mainly around the Golden Horseshoe, while **Ottawa's Greenbelt** refers to federally controlled and protected land managed by the National Capital Commission. Such common names do not need to be defined in every story as long as context makes the meaning clear. In second reference, Greenbelt alone is capitalized (e.g., Ontario's Greenbelt becomes **the Greenbelt**).

**Green Berets

**

**green light** (n.), **greenlight, greenlighted** (v.) Examples: _The project was given a green light. The studio is still deciding whether to greenlight the film._

**Green Line** (generic term for a ceasefire boundary) Since the label is not widely used, it normally requires an explanation in stories unless the context makes the meaning clear. In recent years, Green Line has been applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. See the [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline) for more details.

**green movement** (environmentalists); **Green Party of Canada** (formal name); **Green Party** (acceptable shorthand in first reference); a green party (generic usage) See also [Party versus party](/home/p/party)

**greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases** (See [climate change versus global warming](/home/c/climate-change))

****Greenpeace Foundation****

**greenwash, greenwashing** (one word) Inspired by the term whitewash (to cover up), greenwash originally meant to downplay environmental damage or hazards (e.g., after an oil spill). Since the 1990s, the meaning has widened to include marketing techniques that deceptively promote the perception of eco-friendly practices or products (e.g., through vague or misleading labelling). Although it ultimately depends on a given story's context, the word greenwash can normally be used without definition.

**Greetings**
Capitalize common greetings that specify holidays or other special times (e.g., **Merry Christmas** and **Happy Hanukkah** but season's greetings). See [greetings](/home/g/greetings) for details.

**Grenada** (island in the Caribbean), **Granada** (Spanish city)

**grey** (colour)

**Grey Cup** (see also [football terms](/home/f/football))

**grey goose, greyhound** (fused)

**[grey jay](/home/g/grey_jay)** (common Canadian bird) Prefer this conventional spelling over the U.S. preference "gray." Its other popular name is **whisky jack**. (See also [whisky instead of whiskey](/home/w/whisky))

**grey market, grey matter**

**Grey Panthers**

**grey seal, grey squirrel, grey wolf, grey whale**

**grippe** (informal and fairly archaic term for influenza)

**grisly** (gruesome), **grizzly** (bear)

**Grit, Grits** (Acceptable term for Liberals in second reference and headlines)

****groundbreaking****

**groundcrew** (this aviation term is one word)

**Groundhog Day** (Feb. 2)

**groundswell** (one word)

**Ground Zero** (Use capital letters only when referring to the site of the old World Trade Center, destroyed in 2001.) Otherwise, make it **ground zero**. The Ground Zero site in Manhattan is now officially called the **National September 11 Memorial and Museum**. This can be shortened to the **9/11 Memorial and Museum**, even in first reference, if space is limited. The colloquial term Ground Zero can also continue to be used, based on convention. See also [Sept. 11 attacks](/home/s#Sept11), and [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre)
**Group of Seven** (famous Canadian artists) The seven original members were: Frank Carmichael, Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald and F. H. Varley. Two caveats: (i) Tom Thomson died before the Group of Seven was created in 1920, so he should never be described as a member; and (ii) Use "Frank" for Johnston's first name. He changed it to "Franz" in 1927, three years after resigning from the group. But his paintings feature the signature "Frank," and this is how he should be identified in stories linking him to the Group of Seven.

**Group of Seven** countries, the **G7** (no hyphen) This label refers to seven industrialized democracies: Canada, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan; **Group of Eight** countries, **G8** (no hyphen) This label refers to the G7 plus Russia; **Group of 20**; See [**G8 and G20**](/home/g/g8-g20-2010-summits) for a general overview, as well as for specific spellings and pronunciations of participants in the 2010 G8 and G20 summits in Canada. Although a comma is fine (**G8, G20 summits**), a slash is acceptable and easier to scan (**G8/G20 summits**), especially in graphics and web headlines. Do not use a hyphen, which suggests a joint meeting (i.e., avoid "G8-G20"); **G7 countries, G8 leaders, G20 finance ministers**, etc.

**grow-op, grow-ops** are common and acceptable labels for marijuana growing operation(s). Specifying whether it's an indoor or outdoor grow-op is optional. Such detail is generally unnecessary if a story's facts already make this clear.

**grown-up** (n. and adj.)

****gruesome****

**GST** (acceptable in first reference to **goods and services tax**; does not need to be spelled out) See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines

****guacamole****

**guaranteed income supplement** (GIS) Written out lowercase, along the lines of "child tax benefit" and "registered retirement income fund." While similar abbreviations are usually handled the same way (GST becomes the "goods and services tax"), there are a few exceptions based on convention (e.g., OAS is the Old Age Security program, and CPP is the Canada Pension Plan). See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines

[**guard of honour**](/home/g/guard-of-honour) (prefer over the Canadian spelling of the U.S. term "honour guard" in all cases)

**guardrail** (one word)

**guide, a girl guide** (See [**Girl Guides**](/home/g/girl-guides))

[**Guinness World Records**](/home/g/guinness-world-records) (This is the publication's official name. It was changed in 2000. Keep "book" lowercase.) _"They hope to get into the Guinness World Records book."_

Gulf of Aqaba

Gulf of St. Lawrence (an extension of the Atlantic but a sea in its own right)

****Gulf Stream****

**gun control, gun control legislation** (no [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens)) See also [firearms](/home/w/weapons) for detailed guidelines

****gunfight, gunfire, gunpoint, gunshot*

*gung-ho****

**gunner** (no abbreviation) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**guns** (distinguish between rifles and shotguns) See [**firearms**](/home/w/weapons)

**gunship, gunwale**


**gurdwara** (a Sikh house of worship) Use this spelling of the Punjabi [transliteration](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transliterations/ "Transliterations") for consistency. The plural is **gurdwaras**. Keep lowercase unless part of a proper noun (e.g., the **Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara** in Surrey, B.C.). Gurdwara does not need to be defined in stories as long as the meaning is clear from context. While gurdwaras are conventionally referred to as Sikh temples in Canadian English, including in the official names of centres (e.g., the **Okanagan Sikh Temple and Cultural Society**) as well as on some historic plaques outside buildings (e.g., the [**Abbotsford Sikh Temple**](https://parks.canada.ca/culture/designation/lieu-site/temple-sikh-abbotsford-sikh-temple)), be aware that some community members dislike the English word "temple" as a generic synonym for "gurdwara." While using both terms (gurdwaras and temples) interchangeably in stories can help foster greater cultural awareness in Canada, respect known preferences whenever practical in specific coverage.

**Gurkha** (_not_ Ghurka) Nepalese mercenaries. The term is not limited to a single ethnic group in Nepal.

****gurney****

**[guerrilla](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#guerrilla)** (member of small band of fighters waging surprise attacks); **gorilla** (animal)

**guttural** (_not_ -eral)

**Gwich'in** (a northern [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) people) While Gwich'in is the standard spelling, adopt local preferences in proper nouns when known (e.g., the **Gwich'in Tribal Council** in Inuvik, but the **Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation** of northern Yukon). In rare cases when Gwitchin is the preferred proper noun, members of the band should be called Gwitchin throughout the story for consistency.

**gynecologist, gynecology** (_not_ gynae-)

**gyp** (v.) _Avoid_. Considered offensive as a synonym for "swindle." For details and related guidelines, see: [gyp, blacklist, Indian summer, paddy wagon, etc.](/home/g/gyp)

**Gypsy, Gypsies** (avoid when referring to the nomadic people now widely known as [**Roma**](/home/r#Roma)) The word is also inappropriate when used to imply unlawful conduct, whether capitalized or lowercase, whether in its root form or as a derivative. For example, **do not use gyp as a verb** (e.g., to "gyp" or swindle someone) **or as a pejorative modifier** (e.g., to drive a **gypsy cab** — an archaic label for "illegal" or unlicensed taxi). Be aware that some people object to "gypsy" across the board, regardless of whether the expressions, themselves, are incontestably demonizing. Therefore, it's a good practice to either avoid "gypsy" in these contexts or to limit use to one reference if leaving out the word altogether might confuse our audience. For example, **gypsy swing** and **gypsy jazz** are entrenched genres heavily influenced by traditional **Romani music**. Be respectful while still ensuring audience clarity. For instance, there's no need to refer to the **LDD moth** as the gypsy moth throughout a story. There's also no need to resort to the dense scientific proper noun _Lymantria dispar dispar_. Instead, it's generally OK to use the common name once in if the detail is deemed necessary for audience understanding, and if we flag that the word "gypsy" is offensive (e.g., "**also known as the gypsy moth, which is now considered an ethnic slur**"). Then return to LDD for the rest of the report. When there's more than one common name, prefer the version without the word "gypsy" in it (e.g., "bugleweed" instead of "gypsywort" for the plant scientists call _Lycopus europaeus_).

**Gzowski, Peter** (July 13, 1934 - Jan. 24, 2002) Canadian writer and broadcaster long associated with CBC Radio's Morningside and This Country in the Morning. (See [Peter Gzowski: The Voice of Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Farchives%2Ftopic%2Fpeter-gzowski-voice-of-canada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1sizWq9SSI1H2kerY5z6aP) for background and archived clips)

**Miscellaneous** 

**Links** 

**About the G8**
(Also known as **the Group of Eight**)

MEMBERS: **Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the U.K.** and **the U.S.**

BACKGROUND: **The label G8 describes an informal association of the world's major industrial democracies.** There is no actual organization known as the G8, just as there was no formal institution called the G7. It is not founded on any international treaty. It has no office, staff or budget. Its "presidency" is rotational, with one of its members taking on the role the year that leader's country hosts the G8 summit (e.g., Stephen Harper in 2010).

The term Group of Eight was first used in 1998, when Russia became a part-time member of what had been previously referred to as the G7 (formed in 1975). By 2006, Russia had become a full-time member participating in all talks, including economic and financial discussions.

SUMMITS: **G8 leaders hold annual summits. Each member country hosts the event on a rotational basis.** Agendas deal with everything from international trade and banking regulations to arms controls, policing and security, health, employment, environment, and energy policies. Before the summit, various smaller G8 meetings are held by government representatives (e.g., foreign affairs ministers and their equivalents). Communiqués are normally issued when talks wrap up. News conferences are also common at summits.

**It's worth noting that G7 leaders or their representatives sometimes still get together** (e.g., a meeting of G7 finance ministers). **In other words, the creation of the G8 did not end the G7**, just as creation of the G20 did not end the G8.


**About the G20**
(Also known as **the Group of 20**)

MEMBERS: **Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the U.K, the United States** and the **European Union**.

BACKGROUND: **Formed in 1999, the G20 is made of up of finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 of the world's largest economies** (19 countries as well as the European Union). **In 2008, the heads of governments began participating as well** — turning the previously lower-profile meetings into major summits. In 2010, the G20 economies represented about 85 per cent of the world's gross national product and roughly two-thirds of the planet's population.

There is no actual organization known as the Group of 20. It's merely a forum for consultation, discussion and co-operation on a wide range of issues tied to international finance and trade — from taxation rates and banking regulations to fiscal stimulus plans. During the deep global recession of 2009, G20 leaders announced that they would replace the G8 as the main international group debating economic issues and policies. **Unlike the G8, the G20 includes major developing economies, such as China and India, rather than merely established or "advanced" economies.**

SUMMITS: **Various smaller G20 meetings are held annually** (e.g., the heads of central banks, the finance ministers, deputies). Normally, one or two summits are also held each year (e.g., in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, and in Canada and South Korea in 2010). **Senior officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank traditionally take part in an unofficial capacity.** Communiqués are usually issued at the end of each summit. News conferences are also common.

**Miscellaneous**

-   **When covering protests, all relevant CBC journalistic standards and practices apply.** Remember that crowds are rarely monolithic at international events such as the G8 or G20 summits. **Be as precise as possible** when a particular person or group's grievances are known. Are they environmentalists? Human rights advocates? Anti-poverty lobbyists? Anti-establishment activists? Beyond that, what do they actually want (e.g., tougher laws against pollution, higher corporate taxes, an end to free trade, smaller government, a complete overhaul of the financial system)? **Use accurate language** (e.g., words such as [demonstrators, militants, anarchists, etc.](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist), have different meanings). **Prefer specific detail over vague descriptions** (e.g., write "Hooded protesters overturned parked cars" rather than "Angry militants destroyed property," and write "Police fired a water cannon on protesters trying to scale a fence" rather than "Police kept the crowd under control"). **Attribute anything contestable**, from estimates of crowd sizes to claims about which side started a clash.
-   **Shorten officials' titles whenever possible** (e.g., Argentina’s Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Taiana rather than "Argentina’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship Jorge Taiana").
-   **Use equivalents whenever possible**, since the English words are often translations (e.g., French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde rather than "French Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment Christine Lagarde"). **But retain established exceptions** (e.g., the U.S. has a secretary of state not a foreign minister, and the U.K. has a chancellor of the exchequer not a finance minister).
-   **Follow CBCNews.ca publishing style for [titles](/home/t/titles)** **when posting web stories** (e.g., use capital letters in titles only when directly in front of the current office holder's name, such as Brazil's president but Brazilian President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva). **In television, follow in-house style for "supers"** (the text superimposed over clips and images), which tends to lean toward more initial capital letters in titles.
-   **Follow CBC News style for country names** (e.g., South Korea rather than the Republic of Korea). **Be sure to refer to proper nouns accurately** (e.g., the Bank of Korea), **but make certain the meaning is clear to our audience** (e.g., it might be preferable to talk about South Korea's central bank rather than the Bank of Korea). For this reason, it's often best to use lowercase English equivalents of certain proper nouns (e.g., Germany's central bank rather than Germany's Bundesbank or the Deutsche Bundesbank).
-   **Use a conjunction (G8 and G20) or an oblique stroke (G8/G20) when referring to the summits.** Although the solidus ("/") often indicates "either/or" constructions, it's conventionally acceptable in a compound such as G8/G20. It also helps our audience when scanning web headlines or TV graphics. **But avoid a hyphen**, since that punctuation implies a joint summit (along the lines of Canada-U.S. trade talks). **Keep the words summit and summits lowercase** in web journalism (G20 summit).

**Links**

[G8 Information Centre](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.g7.utoronto.ca%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3QDjtSmS-6vu4MDIwjU96-) (University of Toronto)

### GDP versus GNP

**GDP versus GNP**

**GDP**
**The gross domestic product (GDP) measures the value of all goods and services produced in the country, whether by Canadians or foreign investors.**

It includes income earned by workers, profits made by companies, interest charged by lenders and indirect taxes (e.g., the GST) collected by governments.

The term “**real GDP**” means that the **effects of inflation have been subtracted**. It’s now **the most common gauge of economic activity in Canada**.

Since Confederation, real GDP is estimated to have grown by more than 8000 per cent. If GDP is positive but smaller than a previous month’s increase, the economy is still expanding – although at a slower pace.

Avoid illogical jargon, such as “negative growth.” If GDP falls for an extended period of time, it’s fine to say that the economy is weakening or contracting. “Growth” can slow or stop, but it can never be negative. (See also [recession](/home/r/recession))


**GNP**
In some countries, gross domestic product is used to measure economic activity. (This was the case in the United States until 1991.)

**GNP is the value of all goods and services produced by a country’s citizens, whether at home or through investments abroad.**

GNP is equal to GDP, therefore, plus profits and interest that Canadians receive from other countries, minus profits, dividends and interest paid to foreigners who’ve invested in Canada.

**Given the large amount of foreign investment in Canada, our GNP tends to be smaller than GDP.**

### \-general

**\-general**

When "general" is the second half of a compound, **use a hyphen only when it is the key word:**

  lieutenant-general

  lieutenant-generals

  major-general

  major-generals


A clue is which side takes the "s" in a plural construction. In the above cases, the word _general_ is acting as the noun that's being modified.

**Usually**, however, **there is no hyphen**:


  attorney general

  attorneys general

  auditor general

  auditors general

  consul general

  consuls general

  director general

  directors general

  Governor General    _(capitalize for current)_

  governors general    _(lowercase; past office holders)_

  postmaster general

  postmasters general

  secretary general

  secretaries general


**Since general is acting as an adjective in these compounds, the word does not take the "s" to indicate more than one** senior attorney, auditor, etc.


**United Nations**
Although the United Nations slips a hyphen into the title of the person at its helm, we do not. (**UN Secretary General Kofi Annan**, the **secretary general of the United Nations, the secretary general,former UN secretary general Kurt Waldheim, past UN secretaries general**, etc.)

When someone is named to a position but hasn't actually begun working in an official capacity yet, the qualifier "designate" is often used. In these cases, add only one hyphen and keep the label lowercase, even before a full name:

> UN secretary general-designate Ban Ki-moon was officially scheduled to replace Kofi Annan on Jan. 1, 2007.


Less formal labels such as "incoming" or "next" UN secretary general are also fine in such cases.

See [\-designate versus -elect](/home/p/pm-designate), and **[Governor General](/home/g/governor-general)** and [plural compounds](/home/c/courts-martial-and-other-plural-compounds) (e.g., courts martial).

For more information on when to put these compounds in capital letters (Attorney General, for instance, or Maj.-Gen), see [titles](/home/t/titles) as well as [military ranks](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-ranks/ "Military ranks").

### genocide

**Genocide**

**The word genocide**, coined in the 20th century, **refers to the intentional and widespread extermination of a particular group.** The term "**ethnic cleansing**" is sometimes used, since the victims are often targeted because of their racial or national background.

The 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide broadens the meaning to include acts intended "to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group."

**In news stories, use the word genocide with care. If facts are in dispute, mention this and attribute claims, conclusions, etc., accordingly.**

**For instance**, historians consider the Holocaust a genocide of the Jewish people. Despite the strong views of a few fringe communities, **the Holocaust can be considered a genocide without qualification.** Nazis murdered **six million Jews** from 1933 to the end of the Second World War in 1945. [International Holocaust Remembrance Day](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fcanadian-heritage%2Fservices%2Fcanada-holocaust%2Fabout.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1OyTAwU9uW0i1UASxLlHVG) is marked on Jan. 27 in many countries around the world, including in Canada. Be aware that wildly different estimates of the total number of dead are sometimes cited, especially when non-Jewish victims are included. While it's accurate to say that the Nazis killed **millions of other non-Jewish people** because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., the **exact figure is unknown.**  In particular, the estimate of 11 million that surfaced in the 1970s has no foundation in fact according to historians. [This article](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/non-jewish-victims-of-the-holocaust) published by the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise's Jewish Virtual Library offers additional details.

**Some proper nouns are comparatively obscure, so require a definition high in stories**. For instance, **the Holodomor** is the name of the Soviet-orchestrated mass famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the early 1930s. It is **recognized as a genocide by many governments around the world, including Canada**, which passed the [Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day Act](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flaws-lois.justice.gc.ca%2Feng%2Facts%2Fu-0.4%2Fpage-1.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3klzdgYKYUHapFL1zW8WLH) in 2008.

The word genocide is lowercase, as in **Bosnian genocide** and **Rwandan genocide**.


**Armenian genocide**

In the case of the **mass executions of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks during and after the First World War**, Canada and dozens of other countries have formally recognized the killings as genocide, including Belgium, France, Italy and Russia. So has a United Nations commission, the European Parliament and the Vatican.

Turkish authorities dispute the number of dead, which they set at 300,000. They also maintain that many of the deaths were a legitimate military response to revolution and banditry. They blame the rest on starvation, disease, emigration, etc. However, a strong majority of scholars and historians agree that an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed in what was, indeed, a genocide.

**CBC practice is to refer to these events as a genocide. We should also note, where relevant, that Turkey continues to dispute this term.
**
Armenians commemorate the date **April 24, 1915**, when several hundred Armenian intellectuals were rounded up, arrested and later executed. The word genocide in this context is uppercase because it's treated as a proper noun: **Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day**.

Examples of usage from CBC's coverage of the 100th anniversary of April 24th:


> "Thousands of people are gathering on Parliament Hill this afternoon and will march through Ottawa's downtown streets to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. On April 24th, 1915, Ottoman authorities in what is now present-day Turkey began rounding up and executing Armenians under their rule. An estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed. Millions of people around the world mark April 24 as the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, and more than 20 countries, including Canada, recognize the slaughter of Armenians during the First world War as genocide. Turkey, however, rejects the term."
>
>
>
> "The small nation of Armenia came to a standstill today to mark the day 100 years ago when a genocide began against its people. As many as 1.5 million dead were remembered in a sombre ceremony at the country's massive memorial. In other commemorations and demonstrations around the world, Turkey was condemned for refusing to acknowledge that the killings were an organized campaign of genocide."

### Geography-Cities- World

**Geographical abbreviations**

In first reference, most places need to be identified by more than their full name. **We generally add the province, state, or territory for locations in North America, and the country for other spots in the world.** This extra detail appears between commas:


> _They drove to Estevan, Sask., on Saturday.
> __She moved to Great Falls, Mont., in 1944.
> __He was born in Florence, Italy, during the Second World War._


**Exceptions are made for well-known communities**, as well as for other places when the story has already established the location. If a piece focuses on fruit orchards in B.C., for example, we can write _Kelowna_ (instead of _Kelowna, B.C._,) midway through the copy.

See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) for guidelines on geographical abbreviations in Canada.
See [United States](/home/u/united-states) for guidelines on geographical abbreviations in the U.S.

**Country names
****The Language Guide lists CBC News preferences for the names of certain countries that are referred to in more than one way** around the world (e.g., [**Myanmar**](/home/m/Myanmar), also known as Burma). Always prefer English forms when these are entrenched (e.g., **Ivory Coast** instead of "Côte d'Ivoire" and **Cape Verde** instead of "Cabo Verde"). See [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words) for related guidelines about accents.

**Many countries have slightly different, official names**. Some of these proper nouns still surface periodically in highly formal contexts. Others have virtually disappeared through intentional lack of use by governments over several generations (e.g., "the Dominion of Canada"), even though old legislation remains on the books. **It's an acceptable convention to clip official names of countries**, which can be much longer than what's commonly reported. For example:


> **Afghanistan** (NOT the "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan")
> **Algeria** (NOT the "People's Democratic Republic of Algeria")
> **China** (NOT the "People's Republic of China")
> **Ethiopia** (NOT the "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia")
> **[Gambia](/home/g#Gambia)** (NOT "The Gambia" or the "Republic of The Gambia")
> [**Macedonia**](/home/b/balkans#Macedonia) (NOT "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia")
> **Sri Lanka** (NOT the "Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka")
> **U.K.** or **[United Kingdom](/home/u/united-kingdom)** (NOT the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland")


**In some cases, detail such as a compass point is added to avoid any ambiguity.** Even though this sort of colloquial name is not official, it frequently serves our audience best and, so, is generally the most sensible preference:


> **East Timor** (instead of the "Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste")
> **[North Korea](/home/n#NorthKorea)** (instead of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea")
> **[South Korea](/home/s#SouthKorea)** (instead of the "Republic of Korea")


**From time to time, it can make sense to include an alternative name in a story** (e.g., "**East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste**"). The most common editorial reason is when the alternative name is mentioned in a broadcast clip or a transcribed quote, especially if the less-common proper noun's meaning might not be instantly clear from context. Otherwise, it's usually best to stick with the most common name throughout a report (e.g., East Timor).

NOTE:  **Even when countries have only one official name, care must be taken to avoid errors** (e.g., mistakenly referring to **[Ukraine](/home/u#Ukraine)** as "the Ukraine"). See ["the" before certain geographical proper nouns](/home/t/the-versus-the#geographical) for related guidelines.

**In territorial disputes, we prefer neutral language** (e.g., using "island" instead of "country" in the case of **[Taiwan](/home/t/taiwan)**).

**When two countries' names are very similar, it's important to distinguish between them** to keep our journalism clear and accurate. [**Congo** versus the **Republic of Congo**](/home/c/Congos) are examples.

**Bear in mind that we're not obligated to use short forms or non-English forms**, even when these are recommended by a specific country. **Audience recognition is a core consideration**. So while, say, **France** is virtually always preferred over **the French Republic** because it's so entrenched, **Czechia** is NOT preferred over [**the Czech Republic**](/home/c#Czech-Republic) because the less formal, one-word name is not as widely known. And we continue to use [**Turkey**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/turkey/ "Turkey") instead of **Türkiye**.

**We normally use only one spelling or version** of a proper noun in our journalism. **But in rare cases, [alternative forms of certain geographical names](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#alternative-spellings) may be OK**, depending on the context or the platform (e.g., **St-Pierre-Miquelon, St-Pierre-et-Miquelon** and **Saint Pierre and Miquelon**).

**Cities around the world
****Proper nouns sometimes change for various reasons.** Turkey's largest city, **Instanbul**, was once known as Constantinople, and long before that as Byzantium. Russia's second-largest city, **St. Petersburg**, was changed to Petrograd in 1914, and then to Leningrad in the 1920s, before being rebranded as St. Petersburg again in the 1990s. **Beijing** was commonly known as Peking until the second half of the 20th century, when the new Pinyin "romanization" system was adopted (i.e., new rules for writing Chinese in the roman alphabet).

**The National Geographic Atlas of the World is our main reference book for the spellings of communities outside of Canada. But in some cases we use widely accepted alternatives** (e.g., **Kabul** not "Kabol," **Damascus** not "Dimashq," and **Rome** not "Roma"), so check this intranet site first. Some **[transliterations](/home/t/transliterations)** have changed in recent decades. For example, we write **Kyiv** and **Chornobyl** instead of "Kiev" and "Chernobyl" because these are closer to the original Ukrainian. The same is true of **Kolkata** instead of "Calcutta."

Always put the audience first. Therefore, **if a story doesn't make the location obvious, it's generally best to add the name of the country.**

**Foreign cities that can generally stand alone in first reference appear below.** (For U.S. cities, see the [**United States**](/home/u/united-states) link cited above.) Exceptions to CP style are noted with a recommendation to include the country's name:


> **Algiers, Algeria,** (add country's name)
> **Amsterdam
> ****Athens
> ****Auckland
> ****Baghdad
> ****Bangkok
> ****Barcelona
> ****Beijing
> ****Beirut
> ****Belfast
> ****Berlin
> ****Bogota, Colombia,** (add country's name)
> Bombay (_use_  [**Mumbai**](/home/m#Mumbai) on its own)
> **Brasilia, Brazil,** (add country's name)
> **Brussels
> ****Bucharest
> ****Buenos Aires
> ****Cairo
> **Calcutta (_use_  **[Kolkata](/home/k#Kolkata)** on its own)
> **Canberra
> ****Cape Town
> ****Caracas
> ****Copenhagen
> ****Damascus
> ****Dublin
> ****Edinburgh
> ****Frankfurt
> ****Geneva
> ****Gibraltar
> ****Glasgow
> ****Guatemala City
> ****Hamburg
> ****Hanoi
> ****Havana
> ****Helsinki
> ****Ho Chi Minh City
> ****Hong Kong
> ****Istanbul
> ****Jerusalem
> ****Johannesburg
> ****[Kolkata](/home/k#Kolkata)** (not Calcutta)
> **Kuwait
> ****Lima
> ****Lisbon
> ****London
> ****Luxembourg
> ****Madrid
> ****Marseille
> ****Mexico City
> ****Monaco
> ****Monte Carlo
> ****Moscow
> ****[Mumbai](/home/m#Mumbai)** (not Bombay)
> **Munich
> ****Nairobi
> ****Naples
> ****New Delhi
> ****Panama
> ****Paris
> ****Prague
> ****Rio de Janeiro
> ****Rome
> ****San Salvador
> ****Seoul
> ****Shanghai
> ****Singapore
> ****Stockholm
> ****Tehran
> ****Tel Aviv
> ****The Hague
> ****Tokyo
> ****Tunis, Tunisia,** (add country's name)
> **United Nations
> ****Vatican City
> ****Venice
> ****Vienna
> ****Warsaw
> ****Wellington, New Zealand,** (add country's name)
> **Zurich**

Sometimes deciding when to add a given country's name is subjective, involving not only established convention but also assumptions about the general knowledge of North American audiences, which can evolve over time.

**TIP:** For speed and consistency, we and most major Canadian newsrooms traditionally follow the wires here. This means that when you're in doubt, you can look at CP or AP placelines for direction. For instance,  "**ANKARA, Turkey (AP) —**" but "**AMSTERDAM (AP) —**" at the start of wire copy. 



### German names

**German names**

**When you encounter a German name with an umlaut (e.g., ö or ü), generally type the letter "e" after the vowel that has the diacritical mark** if these spellings have become the entrenched forms in English:


> Bruennhilde
> Duesseldorf
> Goebbels
> Goering
> Schroeder


This is a **well-established convention** for handling German nouns. It **does not apply to other languages.**


**Exceptions**
It's **OK to post umlauts or to ignore them** (i.e., not to add the "e") **if you're following:**


> 1\. An individual's **known preference.**
>
> 2\. An **established English spelling** (e.g., Beethoven's Für Elise).

**Phöney stüff**
**Do not treat invented and pretentious umlauts as real:**

### gerunds\_possessives

**Possessive before gerund**

**It's a myth that nouns and pronouns placed directly in front of gerunds must always be in the possessive form.** English speakers and writers have options. Details and examples are outlined below.



**Grammar at a glance**
**EACH of the following IS CORRECT:**


They do not condone **us smoking** in the house. — (**NP = NON-POSSESSIVE** because "us" is used)
They do not condone **our smoking** in the house. — (**P = POSSESSIVE** because "our" is used)


Critics of the first (NP) sentence say (i) it can initially suggest that "they" do not condone "us" rather than "us smoking," and that (ii) fused participles (e.g., "us smoking") are inherently ungrammatical because comparable constructions do not exist in Latin.

Defenders of the first (NP) sentence say (i) the meaning of "us smoking" is instantly understood because it's so widely used. and that (ii) assessments about English grammar should not be based only, or even primarily, on rules of Latin.


**What's a 'gerund'?**
To better understand why non-possessive constructions such as "us smoking" above are OK, it's **helpful to review some general terminology** before analyzing specific sentence structure. Consider the word WALK:


They will **walk** through the park. (**VERB**)

They were last seen **walking** through the park. (**PRESENT PARTICIPLE**)

They both used **walking** canes. (**PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVE**)

**Walking** is good for you. (**GERUND**, also known as a **VERBAL NOUN**)


In English, then, **a "gerund"** — pronounced with a soft "g" sound, like general — **is simply a specific "-ing" form of a verb acting as a noun.**


**NOTE:** **Many modern grammarians prefer to call gerunds "verbal nouns"** because that label lets them steer clear of a peripheral debate over whether the Latin term "gerund" should even apply in various English constructions. This lack of consensus over suitable jargon illustrates an ideological divide between those who are rigid and those who are more flexible when adjudicating English through a Latin language lens.



**Old quarrel: Possessive vs. non-possessive**
In the **mid-18th century**, a relatively arcane **disagreement erupted: Should a noun or pronoun directly in front of a gerund always be possessive?**


He did not like **them walking** through the park. (**NP = NON-POSSESSIVE**)
He did not like **their walking** through the park. (**P = POSSESSIVE**)


**Some writers and editors insisted on the P form** because it better tracked the way certain verbs become nouns in Latin. **Others questioned whether the P form is even suitable, let alone mandatory, in many English cases.** Since then, **both the NP and P constructions have become well established**, and **many reputable usage guides say that either is usually fine. Nevertheless, a debate continues to rage in some quarters,** especially among disciples of grammarian Henry Watson Fowler who insisted on the possessive form.

In the 1920s, Fowler and renowned Danish linguist Otto Jespersen sparred over sentences like this:


**Women having** the vote reduces men's political power. (**NP**)
**Women's having** the vote reduces men's political power. **(P**)


**Fowler classified "women having" as a bastardized construction** he dubbed a "fused participle." **Jespersen replied that Fowler's insistence on the possessive form ("women's having") was flawed** because it relied on parallels with Latin that are not absolute. Be wary of the "instinctive grammatical moralizer," Jespersen warned. "Each language surely has a right to be judged on its own merits."

Fast forward a century. **The 2015 Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage points out that several factors can influence whether to take the NP or the P path — from individual preference to what a writer wants to emphasize in a given sentence**: "The **non-possessive stresses the verbal action**" while "the **possessive stresses the noun-like quality of the phrase** that follows," it says. For example, the verbs "smoke," "go," "choose" and "to be" arguably stand out more in the NP versions below:


They do not condone **us smoking** at work. (NP)
They do not condone **our smoking** at work. (P)

To many, **the Queen going** there was a surprise. (NP)
To many, **the Queen's going** there was a surprise. (P)

**Picasso losing** the bet led to the painting. (NP)
**Picasso's losing** the bet led to the painting. (P)

Try to imagine the **baby being** born in a moving taxi. (NP)
Try to imagine the **baby's being** born in a moving taxi. (P)


Some writers seem to switch between NP and P on a whim. **The non-possessive form can sound more conversational in some contexts. But there are also times when the NP version can seem to cross the line from being colloquial to strikingly odd** — if not actually uneducated. Personal pronouns at the start of sentences often fall into this category:


**Me dating** his mother made him uncomfortable. (NP and **non-standard**)
**My dating** his mother made him uncomfortable. (P and standard; widely recommended)


**Be on the alert for times when the choice of possessive or non-possessive can change a sentence's meaning**, even subtly:


The dog didn't like **him singing**. (NP)
The dog didn't like **his singing**. (P)


Given all of the above, **CBC News style is to permit both non-possessive and possessive nouns and pronouns before gerunds**, as long as the intended meaning is clear and the choice of wording is not awkward or jarring. Use your judgment. **This approach mirrors a recommendation found in the 2007 Canadian Oxford Guide to English Usage**: "It appears that writers have always varied their use of the possessive with the gerund according to considerations of formality, emphasis, and sound without much self-torment (unless they have read Fowler) and we suggest they continue to do so."

### green paper versus white paper

**Go missing, gone missing, went missing**

**All of these expressions are OK.**

Be aware that **some people find the phrasing inelegant, and prefer alternatives such as vanished, disappeared, etc.** Others, however, don't like what they consider the literal "dematerialization" sense of a magician's puff of smoke that "vanish" and "disappear" can sometimes convey. It largely boils down to personal preference.

**It's a myth that "go missing" is ungrammatical.** The bogus argument is based on the observation that "missing" is a state of being rather than an activity, such as fishing, swimming, walking or skating. You can "go fishing," according to this logic, but you can't "go missing."

"Missing," however, is not a gerund (often called a "verbal noun") like fishing or swimming, so the analogy is hollow and the argument misleading. **"Missing" is simply a noun** (to be missing) **that can also function as an adjective** (a missing person). And **just because a noun happens to have an "ing" ending does not mean that there's a syntactical rule against using it after what amounts to a linking verb** ("go" or "be"), also known as a copula.

**Put another way: One can go crazy, bankrupt, berserk, limp, numb, nuts, Hollywood, etc.** These "go predicative" constructions often suggest an undesirable change, such as deterioration (e.g., **to go bad** means old food has become inedible). But the "go" and "went" developments can be neutral or desirable, too (e.g., **to go all in, green, live, platinum, public**).

In linguistics, the various "go/went" constructions above are all merely "inchoatives," which means they describe a process of change. And **since at least the 1840s, "go missing" and "gone missing" and "went missing" have referred to a sudden or mysterious disappearance clearly and succinctly.** As such, they're highly practical idioms for journalists reporting on missing people, planes, money, etc.

Be aware that for many decades, various prominent CBC broadcasters decried use of "go missing" and "went missing." As recently as the 1990s, CBC Radio and TV style manuals denounced the phrasing, clinging to a misinterpretation of basic grammar. The criticism was never backed by any scholarship, however, illustrating the need for care before internal staff notes are circulated about language.

### got versus gotten

**Got versus gotten**

**Both _got_ and _gotten_ are considered acceptable** as the past participle of _get_ in North America. The same was true in Britain until about 200 years ago. Authorities there now prefer _got_.

**In news stories, it’s generally better to choose _“got”_ because it’s shorter.** (_“The children love the zoo. They’ve got to see the elephants up close many times.”_)

In Canada and the U.S., **“has gotten” often implies a recent acquisition.** (_"Tom's got a bicycle"_ means he owns one, while _"Tom's gotten a bicycle"_ suggests it's just happened.)

In Britain, on the other hand, people have gotten into trouble for trying to breathe life into what's seen as an archaic word.

### Governor General

**Governor General versus governor general**

**The abbreviated title** (before the full name) **is Gov. Gen. There's no hyphen** in either the long or short form. **GG is fine in headlines only.** But avoid using this boiled-down version in the main text except in directly transcribed quotes.

The King is Canada's head of state. Although **the Governor General** is acting head of state when the King is not in the country, we don't generally use this viceregal description in news stories. Instead, we write "**the King's representative,**" etc.

**The plural is governors general.** For more details and related examples (attorneys general but major-generals), see [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix) in compounds.


**Capitalization**
**Capitalize all references to Canada's current Governor General, even when the title is not followed by the name.**

> He plans to meet **the Governor General** Thursday morning.
>
> **The Governor General's** New Year's message focused on Afghanistan.


This is different from prime minister and most other official posts or designations (See [titles](/home/t/titles)). **Interpret this to mean that references to the position of Governor General in Canada not modified by specific terms such as former, past or next are essentially indirect references to the office holder.** So while we'd talk about _former governor general_ Adrienne Clarkson in a story about her, we'd report that Adrienne Clarkson, Romeo Leblanc and Roland Michener have all served as Canada's _Governor General_ in a feature about the viceregal role. This approach leads to a more consistent use of initial capital letters in coverage.

> **the Governor General** (referring to _Canada's_, even when not in front of a name)
>
> **the role of the Governor General** in Canada (indirectly refers to Canada's current office holder)
>
> **Gov. Gen. [Mary Simon](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/#marysimon "S")**
>
> **former governor general** Michaëlle Jean
>
> **Canada's next governor general** will be sworn in next month
>
> **the governor general-designate**
>
> **past governors general** (plural)


Also use uppercase (Gov. Gen.) when placed in front of the name of another country's current governor general.

> **the governor general** (_other countries_)
>
> **Australian Gov. Gen. Michael Jaffery**, _but_ **Australia's governor general**


Other common terms tied to Canada's Governor General:

> **Governor General's Awards**
>
> **Governor General's Literary Awards**
>
> **Governor General's Award for non-fiction**
>
> **Governor General's Award for poetry**
>
> **Governor General's Horse Guards**
>
> **Governor General's Foot Guards**


See [awards](/home/a/award-versus-award) overview for relevant capitalization guidelines


**Spouses**
There is no special term for the spouses of governors general or other viceregal office holders. They are simply identified by name and relationship (husband or wife). For instance:

> **Johnston's wife, Sharon, was also ...**
>
> **Gov. Gen. David Johnston and his wife, Sharon, were greeted ...**
>
> **Johnston and his wife, Sharon, flew to ...**


If the viceregal office holder hasn't been referred to yet by name, the spouse's full name is given:

> **Sharon Johnston, the Governor General's wife, said ...**
>
> **The Governor General's wife, Sharon Johnston, announced ...**


Don't bother including the relationship to the viceregal or former viceregal if it's irrelevant (e.g., in a story about John Ralston Saul that has nothing to do with Adrienne Clarkson).


**The PM picks and the King appoints**
**Prime ministers do NOT appoint governors general. The King must OK the prime minister's choice for this post.** But never write that the King _appoints_ the governor general without putting the verb into context. In essence, the King approves the prime minister's selection. It's often easiest to say that the **prime minister has named** a new governor general, or that **the prime minister has picked** a new governor general and that the King has approved the appointment.

**governor general-designate**
**Until sworn in, this individual is known as the governor general-designate** (lowercase, one hyphen). It's the official term used by the Canadian Heritage Department, although the government's version features capital letters and no punctuation. (See also [designate](/home/p/pm-designate), as in prime minister-designate and governor general-designate.)

The ceremony is officially referred to as an "**installation**," but we can also call it a **swearing-in** since the governor general-designate always takes an oath. It is technically not an investiture, although parts of the installation do include the presentation of honours and ranks.

More information can be found on the [Governor General's website](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gg.ca%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw13SFoqkAjv6FSvCt4Hw2VG).

### grain

### green paper versus white paper

**A green paper versus a white paper**

**Green paper**
A report outlining a problem or an issue, and inviting people to comment on proposed solutions.

**White paper**
A report outlining the government’s plans to introduce specific legislation.

The biggest difference is that **a green paper raises something for discussion before any legislation is drafted.**

**Do not capitalize the names of reports unless you’re using the full, proper title:**

The white paper on defence.

### greetings

**Greetings**


**Capitalize common greetings that specify holidays or other special times** (e.g., Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah **but** happy holidays and season's greetings):

> Happy Birthday
>
> Happy Easter
>
> Happy Father's Day
>
> Happy Hanukkah
>
> Happy Mother's Day
>
> Happy New Year
>
> Happy Thanksgiving
>
> Joyeux Noël
>
> Merry Christmas

_She put an uncooked drumstick on his pillow. Happy Thanksgiving indeed.
For Snow and his son, it was not so much a Happy Birthday as a Happy Father's Day._

### grey jay

**Grey jay, whisky jack**

Use the conventional Canadian spelling (grey) for this bird in all cases. The noun **grey jay** is as entrenched in Canada as **grey goose, greyhound, grey whale** and **grey wolf**. The bird's other popular name is **whisky jack**, believed to be an English corruption of the original Cree word _weskuchanis_. (See also [whisky instead of whiskey](/home/w/whisky))

While **some bird enthusiasts insist that the "correct" spelling is "gray,"** this is based on the U.S. spelling of the word adopted by groups such as the American Ornithologists' Union. **But that doesn't make "gray" an official name.**

A global body, the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), publishes comprehensive lists of bird names that specifically state "grey" and "gray" are equally acceptable. In its flexible spelling rules, the IOC points out other parts of bird names may be rendered differently outside the U.S., such as **colour** (instead of "color"), **moustache** (instead of "mustache"), **sombre** (instead of "somber") and **sulphur** (instead of "sulfur").

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary lists grey jay and whisky jack as the preferred spellings. In scientific circles, the bird is technically known by its [Latin name](/home/l/latin-scientific-names): _Perisoreus canadensis_. But the translation **Canada jay** is not as widely known as either grey jay or whisky jack.


### guard of honour

**Guard of honour**


Prefer the Canadian term **guard of honour** when reporting on all military ceremonies. The U.S. equivalent is honour guard.

It's simpler and more consistent to apply the Canadian term across the board rather than referring to, say, guards of honour in Ottawa and honour guards in Washington. It also avoids the troublesome matter of misspelling "honor." **Never adopt foreign spellings of generic words**. Since this means writing "honour guard" rather than "honor guard" for a U.S. ceremony, the simplest approach is "guard of honour."

The principle of adopting Canadian preferences applies to related ceremonial language, such as always writing [half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) when describing lowered flags around the world rather than identifying and switching to local preferences (e.g., "half-staff" in the U.S.).

In Commonwealth countries, **dignitaries inspect troops** and **inspect guards of honour**. In the U.S., they "review" them. Canada's Defence Department outlines [detailed inspection protocols](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fdepartment-national-defence%2Fservices%2Fmilitary-history%2Fhistory-heritage%2Fdrill-manual%2Fchapter-10.html%232-18&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1AVVMdjiZlfiEkCY8GBrW4) in its ceremonial drill manual.


See [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for related spelling guidelines (e.g., the generic word "centre" versus the proper noun "World Trade Center")

The [Canadian Heritage website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fcanadian-heritage%2Fservices%2Fprotocol-guidelines-special-event%2Fhonours-salutes.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2Rx4iGKeJOZCWdjNTU9ehb) provides details about various military honours, including different types of musical and gun salutes, as well as general criteria for determining the size of a specific guard of honour.

### Guinness World Records

**Guinness World Records**

This is the publication’s new name. So we write, "**the Guinness World Records** book."

Until the 2000 edition, it was known as the Guinness Book of Records. Reporters sometimes wrongly added “World” to the title.

Now the challenge is to add “World” but **keep the word “book” lowercase**.

Correct: _“They hope to get into the Guinness World Records book.”
_
The book, by the way, was originally called the Guinness Book of Superlatives when it was first published by the brewery in 1955. It was pitched as a way to settle bar bets.

For more information, you can visit the [Guinness World Records](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guinnessworldrecords.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw38jt2Hv__IERKhWF_79RyY) website.

### gyp

**Gyp, blacklist, Indian summer, paddy wagon, etc.**

**Some expressions are considered offensive** because they feature **apparent or inferred epithets**, are tinged with **perceived racial overtones**, etc. They may or may not feature proper noun elements (Dutch, Indian).

Demonyms are not inherently unsuitable (e.g., French bread, Greek salad, Chinese cabbage are common and fine). **We don't automatically ban specific terms solely because there's a connection to a country, nationality, culture, etc.** For instance, German measles is a neutral and acceptable synonym for "rubella" that's immediately recognized by our audience.

**But care needs to be taken with language that is derogatory or even potentially derogatory.** Concerns about possible inappropriateness should be taken seriously — given that societal taste and tolerance evolve, along with connotative meanings and usage. **Key factors to consider when reviewing any words or phrases are whether they're clear, entrenched and neutral.** The latter is subjective and includes assessing if a given term could be reasonably perceived as a form of ethnic denigration, cultural misappropriation, etc.

**Examples of acceptable and unacceptable terms appear below.** When in doubt about certain wording, talk to your supervisor.















See also [**'**sounds like' considerations](#sounds-like) at the bottom of this page (e.g., niggardly).


**blackball: Avoid** unless attributed. **Considered racist by an increasing number of people**. The term has meant to eliminate or to vote against for half a millennium, based on the dark-coloured marbles once used when casting "no" in secret balloting. However, the arbitrary choice of black to describe an undesirable outcome makes the term inapt at best.


**blacklist: Avoid** unless attributed. **Considered racist by an increasing number of people.** The term has meant to ban, ostracize or otherwise punish since the 1600s. Its opposite, **whitelist should also be avoided** unless attributed. Because the meanings of "blacklist" (bad, undesirable) and "whitelist" (good, special) are arbitrarily tied to colour, they're outmoded at best. When picking alternatives, **prefer fact-based modifiers** (e.g., do-not-hire list, no-fly list, ineligibility list, approved websites, pre-authorized names, unblocked emails) **and neutral verbs** (e.g., ban, boycott, deny, disqualify, embargo, restrict, allow, approve, favour, grant, permit, qualify). The relatively new word **blocklist** (those blocked) is also an option, as grammatically valid as the old, fused publishing term "backlist."


**black market: Avoid** unless attributed. **Considered racist by an increasing number of people.** The term has meant illicit trade or illegal commerce since the early 1700s, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Although there's no definitive evidence that it originally referred to skin colour, "black market" is now perceived this way by some — making it potentially offensive. For this reason, it's a good idea to **use fact-based, neutral alternatives** (e.g., the **illicit pot market** and the **illegal drug trade**. Steer clear of vague, bureaucratic neologisms (e.g., "legacy" marijuana market). Instead, prefer direct, clear wording (e.g., "unauthorized" sales, "unlicensed" retailers, "unregulated" marketing, "illegal" cannabis production).


**Chinese checkers: Generally avoid** this dated and misleading name for the German board game sternhalma — which, in itself, is simply a variation of other marble-hopping strategy games from the 19th century. **Exceptions are direct quotes and other forms of attribution** (e.g., historical citations). Sternhalma was renamed in the U.S. in the 1930s as part of a company's marketing strategy, even though the game has no connection to Asia and is not actually a form of "checkers" (e.g., opponents' pieces are not removed from play). Be aware that the name "Chinese checkers" is offensive to some, given its roots.


**Chinese wall: Avoid unless attributed.** This once-common term for avoiding conflicts of interest was coined last century and is believed to be a figurative reference to the Great Wall of China. The expression is now considered outmoded, at best, because it arbitrarily labels the need to erect barricades in a way that can be misinterpreted as a characterization of Asian business or trade practices. Prefer alternatives such as firewall, information barrier, ethical screen, etc.


**dark: Avoid as a pejorative in stories about race.** Dark is entrenched and generally OK in literal contexts (a dark night, a dark hole, and dark matter in the cosmos), as well as in various figurative contexts (e.g., a dark mood to mean gloomy, the Dark Ages to mean the early Middle Ages, and a dark horse to mean either little known or unexpectedly successful). However, **the word is almost invariably unsuitable in stories about race.** In those cases, pick an alternative that matches the facts (e.g., "disturbing" replaced "dark" in this 2020 web headline, "Researcher unearths disturbing family history about slavery in Nova Scotia"). Be aware that negative meanings are sometimes deeply ingrained in English (e.g., "denigrate" is Latin for "to darken"). While there's no outright ban against certain conventional usage of "dark" and "darken," we should strive to find alternative wording whenever practical, outside of broadcast clips and directly transcribed quotes.

**Dutch treat: Generally avoid** this description of each person paying his or her own share of expenses. To some it implies that citizens of the Netherlands are cheap.


**German measles:** A common and **perfectly acceptable** term for rubella.


**grandfather clause: Avoid unless attributed.** Beyond the needlessly gender-specific reference to ancestors (i.e., grandfather instead of grandparent), the term historically carries a meaning of racial privilege. It originally described statutory provisions passed by some southern states after the U.S. Civil War to let the descendants of white people maintain the right to vote even though they failed to meet new restrictions about land ownership and literacy levels imposed on Black people trying to register to cast ballots for the first time. Use alternatives such as **exemption, special privilege, vested rights, pre-authorized exception**, etc. The **same approach applies to the verb "grandfathered"** (e.g., use words such as **excluded, exempted, waived**, etc., depending on the specific facts and context).


**gyp: Avoid this verb**, believed to have its roots in the word Gypsy. Considered offensive as a synonym for "swindle." **Also avoid "gyp" and "gypsy" in any other expressions that imply fraud or cheating** (e.g., a "gypsy cab"). Even when a name is entrenched and considered neutral rather than pejorative by many, caution should be exercised and alternatives considered (e.g., "gypsy jazz" and the [**gypsy moth**](/home/g#gypsy)). See also **[Roma and Rom](/home/r#Roma)**, which are preferred over Gypsies and Gypsy.


**Indian giver: Do not use.** The term is racist. It implies deceit or selfishness.


**Indian summer: Avoid** unless attributed because it can be considered offensive, even though the etymology is uncertain. There's a possibility that Indian summer has nothing to do with "false" summer. It may simply refer to warm fall weather that [Indigenous people](/home/i/Indigenous) traditionally took advantage of for harvesting or hunting. Since the origins are unclear, however, and since it's perceived by many to suggest a phoney season, rewording is recommended.


**paddy wagon: Do not use.** Prefer police van or police wagon. "Paddy" is a common nickname for Patrick. The term paddy wagon, coined in North America in the early 1900s, is the equivalent of calling the vehicles "Irish wagons." There are debates over the exact origin of the expression — from claims that Irish immigrants were often rowdy and needed to be locked up to suggestions that the wagons were commonly driven by Irish police officers in parts of the U.S. In either case, the Oxford English Dictionary points out that the term Paddy, itself, is frequently considered an offensive nickname for the Irish. When we use it, we get complaints.


**scot-free:** It's a common but **potentially problematic** description of getting away without paying. The expression has nothing to do with Scotland. "Scot" is an old Norse word that meant a type of tax. Not everyone knows this, however, so you risk offending some people by using it. You pay another price too, because it's a cliché, which is arguably the strongest reason to use different wording.


**spade a spade: Generally avoid** the expression "to call a spade a spade" because it's **increasingly perceived as offensive**, even though the original meaning had nothing to do with the racial slur "spade." The idiom "to call a spade a spade" has meant "to be blunt" or "to use direct language" since the 1500s. It's based on what appears to be an English mistranslation of a Latin version of the original Greek expression, "to call a fig a fig and a trough a trough," according to the Oxford English Dictionary. The term "spade" has meant a digging tool for more than a millennium, which is why it's synonymous for a modern-day shovel. It's also one of the four suits in a standard pack of playing cards, based on the image of spear-like tips of medieval weapons, such as pikes. (Cards have featured different suit symbols for centuries, depending on the language/culture of players, from bells, roses and leaves to acorns and shields. Today's iconic symbols — hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades — are French, with "clubs" intended to represent clovers.) There are dozens of entrenched idioms based on card games, such as to be "dealt a bad hand," to "play one's cards right," to "follow suit," to "lay one's cards on the table," and to have an "ace in the hole," (i.e., something advantageous but not yet used or revealed, with "hole" meaning a card dealt facedown). These idioms include the **perfectly acceptable expression "in spades"** (i.e., to have in abundance, especially something of value), since the plural noun is unambiguous in this context — with "spades" deemed the highest suit in games like bridge. However, "to call a spade a spade" is different because the word "spade" has also been a racial slur for a Black person since at least the 1920s, originally in the U.S. but later in Europe with books like the 1957 novel, _City of Spades_, about a Nigerian immigrant witnessing the emergence of Black culture in London, England. Given this reality, **careful writers steer clear of "to call a spade a spade," irrespective of its original meaning**, or the fact that it appears in stories by the likes of Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde. Alternatives include, "to say what's on your mind," "to speak plainly" and "to say it like it is." Another option is to adopt figurative forms from other languages, such as, "to call a cat a cat" (French), and "to call bread bread and wine wine" (Spanish).

## 'Sounds like' considerations

**Careful writers and editors are mindful that certain words can simply look or sound objectionable.** Examples are "**niggardly**" for cheapness and "**a chink in the armour**" for weakness or vulnerability.

Just because linguistic scholarship stresses that such expressions are not innately hateful, or that they have a long history of neutral usage, doesn't mean the phrasing won't cause confusion and inadvertent offence. **Perception matters**, as noted in the [scot-free](#scot-free) caveat above. Furthermore, **when there are plenty of alternatives available** (e.g., frugal, miserly, stingy for niggardly, and a flaw, gap or hole in the armour for chink), **insisting on the "sounds like a slur" choice becomes increasingly difficult to justify.**

Bear in mind that **we make similar editorial choices in other contexts, both consciously and unconsciously** (e.g., generally preferring to refer to court witnesses "identifying the accused" rather than to them "fingering the accused," even though the latter is a synonym). Remember, too, that **etymology, alone, is not sufficient to justify the use of blatantly objectionable language** (e.g., it's irrelevant that the N-word's roots are Latin for "black").

**Haida** (_singular and plural_ for [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) group, people)

**Haida Gwaii** (Indigenous name formally restored as official proper noun in June 2010) Always use Haida Gwaii in first reference. For several years, we often added "previously known as the Queen Charlotte Islands" — or words to that effect — once in stories to help our audience identify the location. But such detail has become increasingly unnecessary over time. Haida Gwaii is made up of more than 150 islands about 90 kilometres west of British Columbia's north coast. The [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) name, which means "Islands of the People," was officially adopted by the province several years after becoming the entrenched preference of local residents. Haida leaders called the name change an important step toward abandoning colonialism and building a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. The archipelago is shaped like an inverted triangle, about 100 kilometres wide across its top end and narrowing to a tip about 300 kilometres to the south.

**Haiti** (OK in first reference. Does not need to be called the "Republic of Haiti.") Never imply that this Caribbean country is an island unto itself. Haiti is on the western side of the island of Hispaniola. A separate country, the Dominican Republic, occupies the eastern side.

**Hajj** (pilgrimage to Mecca at a specific time of year undertaken at least one in the life of every Muslim physically and financially able to make the journey) Although listed for years as a lowercase noun in many reference books, including the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, a capital H is now the common spelling. The gender-specific terms for pilgrimage participants, however, remain lowercase (i.e., **hajji** for a man and **hajjah** for a woman).

**hakapik** (not "–pick") A spiked club used in seal hunting. The word is not in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, but it is mentioned in Canada's Fisheries Act, along with rules about how to strike and kill the animals.

**Harris-Decima** (polling company) In logos and news releases, this research company uses various forms of its name, including "harrisdecima" fused and Harris/Decima with a slash. But we follow conventional punctuation when reporting such proper nouns and use a hyphen. There's generally no need to add additional hyphens, however, in compound constructions. Examples: a **Harris-Decima study**, a CBC **Harris-Decima survey**, a **Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll**.

**hat trick** (See also [hockey terms](/home/h/hockey))

**hazmat** (fused) Acceptable shorthand for **hazardous material(s)**, as in a **hazmat cleanup, hazmat mask, hazmat spill, hazmat suit**, etc. Although the colloquial term was spelled "haz-mat" for years, the hyphen is less common now. For consistency, keep the word fused.

****H-bomb****

**HDTV** (OK in first reference for high-definition television; no need to spell out); **HD DVD** (no hyphen). Note: HD DVD is a specific high-definition DVD format (competing directly with **Blu-ray**) rather than a generic term to describe a high-definition DVD.

*hectare**** One hectare is equal to the area of a square measuring 100 metres on each side. In other words, 100 hectares is the same thing as one square kilometre. Both hectares and square kilometres are acceptable units of measurement for the size of a given portion of land, [such as in the case of a wildfire](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-05-15-hectares-and-square-kilometres/ "2025 05 15 - Hectares and square kilometres"), but the unit of measurement should be consistent in any given story.

**Holland** (only one part of [**the Netherlands**](/home/n/netherlands-versus-holland)) Except in casual contexts or cases established by convention (e.g., descriptions of Second World War battles), generally avoid calling the country Holland.

**holy city** (lowercase) A description that's normally too subjective or vague for general news stories. Exceptions are background features that put the label into context. Since holy city is applied to various spots in the world, from Jerusalem and Bethlehem to Najaf in Iraq, it's conventionally lowercase. Although the term instantly suggests religious significance, the actual historical importance of a one city to a given faith may be irrelevant or disputed by another faith. Compare with [Holy Land](/home/h#HolyLand) below.

**Holy Father** (generally avoid except in quotes) Use [the Pope](/home/p/pope) instead

**Holy Grail** (Christ's chalice at Last Supper); **grail** (any quest, as in "Cars that run on water became their holy grail")

**Holy Land** (capital letters) A common term that refers to what is now Israel and Palestinian territories near or along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. The region holds significance for several religions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Although Holy Land is acceptable in some contexts, specific proper nouns are normally preferred in our journalism (e.g., Israel, Gaza, the West Bank). Compare with [holy city](/home/h#holycity) above. See also the [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary) for detailed language guidelines about the region.

[**home in on**](/home/h/home-in-on) (not hone in on)

**homeless** (adj.), **homelessness** (n.) Refers to people living on the street or staying in temporary shelters run by governments, charities, etc., rather than to individuals moving frequently to stay employed (e.g., migrant workers). Be clear but respectful when reporting on people without a fixed residence. Mention the detail only when relevant, and avoid stereotyping individuals as unhygienic, mentally ill, addicted to drugs or alcohol, criminals, etc. The word "homeless" is generally OK as an adjective (**homeless people**) or as an attributive noun (**people who are homeless**). But avoid using as a collective noun after the definite article (i.e., "the homeless"), which is considered dehumanizing. This is akin to how we approach reporting on [blind people, deaf people and disabled people](/home/d/disability-language#the). Conversational alternatives include "people without homes," "people without housing," "people living in shelters" and "people living on the street," depending on a given story's facts. Do not use stigmatizing or pejorative labels to characterize homelessness (e.g., bum, beggar, hobo, tramp). Outside of directly transcribed quotes, **generally avoid the comparatively obscure word houseless**, which is less inclusive (ignoring millions of tenants who live in apartments, condos, etc.), and less clear to our audience than homeless. While some activists argue that a pitched tent or other place of shelter can be enjoyed as a "home" under the right circumstances, that reality does not, in itself, alter the conventional meaning of the term "homeless." **The nouns camp and encampment are both common and OK** when describing parks, sidewalks and other public land where people have pitched tents and started living for extended periods. Such usage is similar to compounds like "refugee camp," coined in the 1860s. Many human rights groups and public housing advocates use the terms **homeless camp** and **homeless encampment** neutrally. The language is also found in various government documents, including [Action Canada's 2023 report Tent Nation](https://actioncanada.ca/publications/tent-nation-responding-to-the-rise-of-housing-encampments-the-homelessness-crisis-in-canada/). 

**homey** (not homy)

[**homicide**](/home/h/homicide) (murder, manslaughter, etc.)

[**Hong Kong**](/home/h/hong-kong) (It's unnecessary to use the full name: _Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China_.) Do not call it a territory.

**honky-tonk** (hyphen)

**honour, honourable, honouree** but **honorary** See [our and or](/home/s/spelling/our)

honour guard (Canadian spelling of U.S. term) Use **[guard of honour](/home/g/guard-of-honour)** instead

**honour killing** (use with caution and a qualifier) Avoid this term unless it's introduced as a "so-called honour killing" (in a web headline, quotation marks are sufficient to convey this point). Then make sure the meaning is clear in the story, either based on the details presented or by a brief definition. "Honour killings" are normally murders committed because of patriarchal concepts of honour and shame. They're considered gender-based crimes, since girls and women are usually the victims. People in some cultures either encourage or tolerate the practice, so the term has gradually become part of everyday speech. Using it conveys a lot of information about a type of death and helps our audience understand a story better. But since there's nothing honourable about the killings, the adjective [so-called](/home/s/so-called) is mandatory. Avoid overuse of "honour killings" within a story, and continue to qualify the term throughout the piece to make it clear that the language is disputed and controversial.

**hoodie** (a hooded sweatshirt)

**hoof, hoofs** (See also [foot-and-mouth disease](/home/f/foot-and-mouth-disease))

**hooker** (generally avoid in routine news coverage because of its tone) See [prostitute](/home/p/prostitute) for related guidelines

**hoopla**

**hormone therapy** (**HT**) Spell out in first reference. Avoid the longer, now-dated label "hormone replacement therapy" (abbreviated as HRT) outside of transcribed clips. Hormone therapy falls into two broad categories: Adding hormones (e.g., estrogen, progestin, testosterone) or blocking/changing hormone production/behaviour. Potential health risks are well-documented (e.g., blood clots, stroke, heart disease, cancer). The term hormone therapy often implies treatment for menopausal symptoms. But since there are other reasons people undergo HR (e.g., to assist gender transition, to try to slow the spread of cancer), it's often clearest to add a relevant modifier in first reference (e.g., **menopausal hormone therapy, transgender hormone therapy**). Another option is to use a conversational, descriptive phrase that applies to a given story ("hormone therapy for women entering menopause").

**horse**
**horseback, horsehair, horsehide, horse head** (animal's head) versus **horsehead** (type of pump), **horseflesh, horsemeat, horseplay, horseshoe, horsetail** (one word); **horse race** (but racehorse), **horse sense, horse whisperer** (two words)

**hospital**
hospital commission, Dartmouth hospital commission, Pasqua Hospital, a hospital in Regina, Red Deer Regional Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children, Moncton Hospital Board, etc. Be aware that names can change. For instance, the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary originally opened as the Foothills Hospital in the 1960s. But in second reference, it's now the Foothills hospital (lowercase "h"), the Foothills, the medical centre, the hospital, etc.

**hostage-taking** (adj. and n.)


**hot**
hotbox, hotcake, hotdog, hotfoot, hothead, hotheaded, hothouse, hotline (_but_ prefer open-line) show, hotplate, hotrod, hotshot (all one word); _but_ hot air, hot-blooded, hot cross bun, hot potato, hot spot, hot water

**Hotmail** (It's a [trademark](/home/t/trade-names) so use a capital "H" unless the word is written as part of an actual email address, such as proprietarypete@hotmail.com)

**hotel** (keep lowercase except in names) Delta Bessborough Hotel, a Saskatoon hotel, Royal York Hotel, Hotel Saskatchewan, etc.
**
hour-long** (See also [long as a suffix](/home/l#longsuffix))

**House of Commons; House of Assembly;** but the **upper house** for Senate (See [House versus house](/home/h/house))

**HOV** (**high-occupancy vehicle**), **HOV lanes** (The abbreviation is OK in first reference, especially in headlines where space is at a premium. But generally spell out once early on in stories whenever possible, since not all Canadians are familiar with the term.) NOTE: The unabridged form is lowercase and conventionally features a hyphen. See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines

**HPV** (fine in headlines and first reference as long as **human papillomavirus** is clearly spelled out elsewhere in the story)

**HSBC Bank Canada** (see [banks](/home/b/banks) for guidelines)

**HST** (acceptable in first reference) Spell out in lowercase as **harmonized sales tax**, along the lines of GST for goods and services tax. See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines

**HTML** (hypertext markup language; lowercase when spelled out) See also [internet terms](/home/i/internet-terms)

**[hunger strike](/home/h/hunger-strike)**

**Huntington's disease** (named after U.S. doctor George Huntington, who originally called it "hereditary chorea" in the 1870s) **Huntington's** is an inherited disease that gradually breaks down nerve cells in the brain. It can cause mobility, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Treat the noun as a possessive, but be aware that the apostrophe is missing from the official spellings of some proper nouns (e.g., the **Huntington Society of Canada**). See the editorial caveat under (See [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#propernouns) (Down versus Alzheimer's) for details.

**[hurricane](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon), Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Katrina** (Harvey, Katrina in second reference; or "the hurricane" lowercase. "Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane." See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines.) Do not apply the pronouns "she," "her," "he" or "his" to storms. Use "it" and "its" instead. See also [earthquakes](/home/e/earthquakes)

**hush money** (common and generally acceptable term for certain [**non-disclosure agreements**](/home/n#non-disclosure), especially contracts that involve scandal or alleged crimes — from silencing accusations of sexual assault to keeping evidence of affairs confidential)

**Hyundai Corp.** of South Korea is the parent company. It owns **Hyundai Motor Co.**, which in turn owns **Hyundai Canada** and **Hyundai Auto Canada**. When it's necessary to add this level of detail to certain stories, it's simplest and clearest to say that the Canadian subsidiaries are owned by Hyundai of South Korea.

### hail versus hale

**Hail versus hale**

These words sometimes cause confusion.

**Hail can mean a variety of things,** including frozen pellets from the sky (_“the rain turned into hail”_) and a barrage (_“a hail of bullets”_). As a verb, it can mean to shower (_“hailed abuse at them”_), to signal (_“hail a cab”_), to proclaim or commend (_“hailed her a success”_), to come from (_“he hails from the Maritimes”_) and to greet or communicate with (_“within hailing distance”_).

**Hale normally means healthy** (as in the expression _“hale and hearty”_). As a verb, it refers to dragging forcibly (“haled them into court”), although this form of the word is archaic and will probably be read as a typo by many people. In these cases, you’re better off writing “hauled” or picking a different word.

The expression _“hail fellow well met”_ is commonly misspelled as “hale,” since the latter means robust. The fellow described is someone who is easy to get along with, not someone who is well.

### half-mast

**Half-mast versus half-staff**

**Use the term "half-mast" to describe flags lowered after someone's death.** This preference was adopted by CBC News decades ago.

When Ottawa orders flags lowered, the term "half-mast" is used. This expression is part of the Canadian Heritage Department's official [flag etiquette](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcanada.pch.gc.ca%2Feng%2F1444133232495&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3LhGou9NOaZeSsPnNfJjpU), which covers everything from the correct way to drape a casket with the Maple Leaf to the right way to dispose of worn out flags.

Most Americans use the term "half-staff." This wording is also found in the United States official "Flag Code" (Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 7, Subsection M).

As with [railway](/home/r/railway-versus-railroad) (instead of "railroad"), and [witness box](/home/c/canadian-court-terms) (instead of "witness stand"), "half-mast" is considered the "Canadian" choice by many people in this country. See also [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview) for other Canadian preferences and related language, as well as [funerals](/home/f/funerals).


**Mast**
**The word "mast" does not automatically imply ships.** According to British and North American dictionaries, there is evidence that it is tied to a Latin word for "stake" (_palus_), an Irish word for "club" (_maite_), and an Indo-European expression for "rod" (_mazdos_). Some lexicographers believe it may also have roots in an old term for "timber."

The Oxford English Dictionary points out that people have been calling tall poles on land masts for more than 350 years — from towers that guide travellers in the mountains to those that support telegraph wires and broadcasting equipment.

For a longer discussion, see the November 2000 Words: Woe & Wonder column, [Flap over Half-Mast](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fflagflap.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3BqDGsVj48SMzgKMMpv4dR).

### health\_reporting

**Health reporting** (diseases, medical conditions, etc.)

**Core journalistic principles govern health reporting**, including **how we refer to diseases, illnesses, disorders** and other medical conditions:


[3\. Clarity](/home/h/health_reporting#clarity) (e.g., translate/explain jargon)
[4\. Respect](/home/h/health_reporting#respect) (e.g., some patients object to certain words, like 'battling' and 'survivor')

**In addition, some specific guidelines apply:**

[5\. JSP policy](/home/h/health_reporting#JSP) (e.g., handling medical research)
[6\. CBC News publishing style](/home/h/health_reporting#typography) (e.g., capitalization and other typography)

The rest of this entry expands on the above points.


**1\. Relevance**
**Avoid referring to a person's medical condition** (physical and mental) **unless it's relevant to a given story.** Why are we reporting that someone has hepatitis B, uses hearing aids, is colour blind, needs a wheelchair to get around, etc.? Even when directly relevant, certain information can be highly personal. So pause to weigh all applicable privacy concerns against any clear, public (societal) value of reporting such details.


**2\. Accuracy**
**Use medical terms correctly. If you're not sure what something means, double-check.** Imprecision can lead to confusion and inaccuracy. For instance, [diagnosis and prognosis](/home/d/diagnosis-versus-prognosis) have specific meanings. So do words like [endemic, epidemic and pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic), as well as [confirmed versus presumptive](/home/c/confirmed_presumptive_tests). And always take the time to corroborate key facts (e.g., since [bacteria and viruses](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) are different, we need to be careful when covering diseases like meningitis, which can be bacterial or viral). Even generic terms that may normally be treated as synonyms might require care in certain contexts to avoid confusion (e.g., the FDA's distinction between [emergency "authorization" versus routine "approval"](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/immunization-vaccination/#authorize-vs-approve "Immunization vaccination")). **Be aware that certain common terms sometimes have different meanings in medicine. In daily journalism, however, conventional definitions generally suffice.** This includes some colloquial English words rooted in medicine and science. For instance, while "jaundice" literally describes obstructed bile ducts and other liver disorders, being "jaundiced" also figuratively means bitterness and envy. And while "phobia" and "mania" have narrow, technical meanings in medicine (i.e., a "morbid, incapacitating fear" and an "excited madness," respectively), the same words have entrenched, acceptable meanings in other contexts (e.g., "irrational fear" and "passionate desire," respectively). The compounds [self-quarantine and self-isolation](/home/q#quarantine) are usually OK as synonyms for the same reason. See also [disease, disorder, illness](/home/d/disease_illness).


**3\. Clarity**
**Define unfamiliar terms in understandable English.** It's pointless to be accurate but incomprehensible. **Sometimes, explanations are built-in.** For example, if a researcher refers to something being "asymptomatic" and the context makes the term's meaning clear (i.e., showing no symptoms), we can generally leave the clip or quote as-is without risk of confusion. **At other times, however, the highfalutin stuff should be translated into plain English** (e.g., "pathophysiological" means "abnormal changes to the body"). This includes the formal names of certain medical conditions and procedures (e.g., prefer "clogged arteries" over "atherosclerosis," "taking a blood sample" over performing a "phlebotomy," and "brain freeze" or "ice cream headache" over "sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia"). **Certain abbreviations are so familiar it's unnecessary to spell them out** (e.g., we simply say DNA instead of "deoxyribonucleic acid"). Other proper nouns, meanwhile, are defined by common synonyms (e.g., ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). Of course, it can be helpful to explain that ALS is a neurodegenerative condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. But it's generally valueless to spell it out as "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis," unless you're working on, say, an in-depth medical feature on different types of sclerosis.


**4\. Respect**
**When referring to people by name, we should take into account any objections they may have to certain wording.** For instance, **some patients strongly oppose active, descriptive participles like "fighting" or "battling" a disease** for various reasons (e.g., they say combat terminology can suggest that those who die are "losers"). **They also object to words like "victim" and "hero,"** pointing out that some terms can unintentionally imply self-pity or falsely equate medical treatment with altruistic courage. **And they dislike labels like "survivor"** (e.g., a "cancer survivor"), because such words appear to ignore the reality of remission and recurrence. **While we should try to respect known preferences when reporting on specific individuals, we do not ban these conventional expressions across the board.** For starters, many patients proudly talk about trying to "beat" a disease, to "fighting" to spend as much time as possible with loved ones, to "standing up" to cancer, to being "survivors," etc. So there's no consensus over what's appropriate. Furthermore, certain war-like wording is deeply entrenched in medicine (e.g., cells "attacking" other cells, a body's immune system "fighting" an infection). **Nevertheless, be aware that some language surrounding disease is potentially controversial.** At a minimum, we should make an effort to adhere to rudimentary principles of respect when reporting on specific patients. **The simplest approach is to prefer neutral, fact-based constructions** (e.g., they have cancer, she is undergoing treatment for leukemia, he had surgery to remove a brain tumour in 2010).


**5\. JSP policy**
**All applicable [JSP guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fscience-and-health-science-et-sante-1.4523552&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw12PF893kltGX46gsTl5iTd) apply, including the way we cover scientific studies and medical research** — from identifying known sponsors of drug trials, health papers, etc., to reporting the true implications of results clearly and responsibly. Among other things, this means we avoid arousing unfounded hopes or fears among patients and their loved ones.


**6\. CBC News publishing style**
**For consistency, follow in-house typography** (e.g., [AIDS](/home/a/aids) is spelled out lowercase as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease are both capitalized but only one has a possessive apostrophe, and "tumour" is spelled "-our" while "tumorous" is "-or"). **Also, adhere to standard English usage.** For example, do not add the word "surgery" or "operation" after medical procedures ending in "-ectomy," such as appendectomy, hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and vasectomy, since these are already implied by the noun's suffix, and differentiate between "cardiac arrest" (a stopped heart) and a "heart attack" (heart muscle damage), which may or may not lead to cardiac arrest.

### Hispanic\_Latino

**Hispanic, Latino, Mexican, etc.**

[Genderless caveat](/home/h/hispanic_latino#genderless-caveat) (Avoid Latina, Latinx, etc.)



**Relevance, accuracy**

**Do not include details about ethnic or cultural backgrounds unless relevant to a given story, whether specific** (Mexican, Cuban, Chilean, Nicaraguan) **or general** (Hispanic, Caribbean, South American, Central American). In features, biographical information is often OK as part of a routine sketch or profile. But in other news coverage, such personal background must be demonstrably tied to the story.

**Be careful not to confuse terminology.** For example, **Hispanic, Latino and Mexican are ethnic descriptions rather than racial labels.** "Ethnicity" refers to nationality, language, regional culture, etc., while "race" is an overused and sometimes hotly debated word that refers to physical features, such as skin colour. (See [Black, white and related racial terms](/home/r/racial-terms) for details)


**Hispanic**

**Hispanic** (plural **Hispanics**) — **Not gender specific.** Conventionally refers to people with Spanish roots, or to **people from Spanish-speaking countries, who are not actually Spanish (i.e., who are not from Spain)**. This includes millions of people in parts of South America, Central America and the Caribbean. **Avoid misidentifying countries as Hispanic.** For instance, Venezuela is classified as Hispanic while Brazil is not because the latter country's official language is Portuguese.


**Latino**

**Latino** (plural **Latinos**) — **Not gender specific in English**. Broadly describes **citizens of Latin America or people with Latin American roots**. Latin America, in turn, is **a sweeping label that includes all countries in central and southern part of the Western Hemisphere where Romance languages are predominately spoken** (Spanish, Portuguese and French). **Avoid Latina, Latinx, etc.**, unless people refer to themselves that way. Even then, obscure neologisms like Latinx need to be defined. (See [genderless caveat](/home/h/hispanic_latino#genderless-caveat) below).

The proper noun **Latin America** was coined in the 1850s. "Latin" in this context refers to the common Latin spoken millennia ago that gave birth to several tongues still alive today, such as Spanish in Puerto Rico and French in Haiti. Although Quebec, St-Pierre-Miquelon and a few other spots in North America technically fall into the broadest definition of Latin America, we describe these places as francophone, instead.


**Mexican**

**Mexican** — Refers to citizens of Mexico and to their descendants living abroad. **It's potentially confusing to use the word to refer to citizens of other countries**, however, since Mexican is a standard demonym, along the lines of Brazilian, Colombian, Panamanian. **For this reason, dual heritage compounds are sometimes used** (e.g., a Mexican Canadian, a Mexican American). **Hispanic or Latino are other common options.** The upside: Hispanic and Latino are more conversational than "Mexican American." The downside: They're vague, since either word could apply to people from numerous other countries. **Avoid terms like Chicano and Chicana** — which refer to U.S.-born males and females of Mexican descent, respectively — unless defined and relevant to a story (e.g., used by someone in an online quote or broadcast clip).

See also [geographical demonyms](/home/r/racial-terms#geographical) for related guidelines on why hyphens are no longer used in labels like African American and Mexican Canadian.


**Genderless caveat**  (Avoid Latina, Latinx, etc.)

We write in English, not in Spanish, Portuguese or other languages. **In English, terms such as [Hispanic](/home/h/hispanic_latino#Hispanic) and [Latino](/home/h/hispanic_latino#Latino) apply to all genders.** It's no different from, say, "amigo" — which means "friend" in English, regardless of gender. Although in Spanish, "amiga" refers to female friends, this fact is irrelevant when reporting in English. The terms "amigo" and "amigos" apply across the board, regardless of gender.

**Be aware that some activists consider "Latino" sexist**, and have campaigned to replace it with various neologisms, such as Latinx and Latin@. **But this push to ban Latino is contested for several reasons:**

-   Many people still call themselves Latino.
-   Most of our audience is unfamiliar with coinages like "Latinx" and "Latin@," which look like typos.
-   There's no consensus over pronunciation of proposed alternatives like Latinx and Latin@.

Furthermore, **the crux of the complaint is that the word "Latino" is masculine in Spanish. But so are countless other words in Romance languages, including French**. And opening that door would require a rudimentary restructuring of those tongues — far beyond the scope of an English news service.

At the end of the day, **many foreign terms are swallowed up by English and used in ways that are different from the original language**. For instance, the Latin word "alumnus" now means any graduate of a school, regardless of gender, just as Latino means anyone from Latin America, regardless of gender. **We steer clear of the gender-specific word "alumna"** (plural "alumnae") **to identify female graduates, just as we normally avoid the gender-specific "Latina"** (plural "Latinas") **to mean women and girls from Latin America**. Exceptions are when people describe themselves as Latina (e.g., in directly transcribed quotes).

> [Yom Kippur](/home/y#YomKippur)


While specific time periods are capitalized (e.g., Day, Eve, Week, Month) in these cases, generic terms such as breakfast, fireworks, parade, etc., are kept lowercase:

>
>
> Canada Day fireworks
>
> Christmas card
>
> Halloween pumpkin
>
> Labour Day parade
>
> New Year's resolution
>
> Pride festivities
>
> Stampede breakfast


An exception is Dyke March during Pride Week, which is historically treated as a compound proper noun (with March capitalized) rather than as a descriptive term like Pride parade, which features a lowercase "p" in parade (see [2SLGBTQ+](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#miscellaneous "2SLGBTQ+")).

See also [greetings](/home/g/greetings) for guidelines on **Happy Birthday** and **Merry Christmas** versus **happy holidays** and **season's greetings**

### home in on

**Home in on**

Write **home in on** (_not_ "hone in" on).

The expression means finding a target. This is what homing pigeons and radars do.

Since “hone” means to sharpen, “home in” is sometimes spelled “hone in.”

We sharpen things, but we don’t generally talk about sharpening _in_ on them. For consistency and logic, use the original spelling.

### homicide

**Homicide**

**All murders are homicides but not all homicides are murder.** Do not use these words interchangeably.

Also, **do not assume all homicide investigators are _detectives_.** Use this title only if it applies.

The term **homicide refers to the death of one person by another.**

There are **two types: culpable and not culpable.**


**Not culpable**
**Homicide that is _not culpable_ is not a crime.**

Common examples are when the killer acted in self-defence or when the death was accidental and did not involve negligence.

In news stories, the term “not culpable” is unnecessarily technical. Instead, we prefer to use **simpler but equally accurate language** (e.g., “no charges were laid because investigators said the death was an accident.”)


**Culpable**
**Homicide that is culpable is a crime.** In other words, **there is no legal justification for the killing.**

Common charges are murder and manslaughter.

**Murder** in the broadest sense means to intentionally kill someone, or to willfully cause serious bodily harm without caring if the person might die. The key is intent.

**Manslaughter** describes an unlawful death that is not murder or infanticide. This usually means the killing was either (a) illegal but unintentional or (b) committed “in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation,” to quote the Criminal Code.

**Set aside most '-icides'**
**Generally avoid neologisms or established but relatively obscure terms** such as **femicide** (killing a woman), **fratricide** (killing a sibling), **matricide** (killing one’s mother), **patricide** (killing one’s father), etc., unless attributed. Even then, the word may need to be defined unless the meaning is obvious from context. **Infanticide**, however, is a Criminal Code charge. It is laid against a mother who kills her newborn child under certain conditions.


**Mass murder**
While **there's no single definition of "mass murder,"** in routine crime reporting **CBC News normally uses the term for cases involving four or more homicides by the same killer(s) within a small geographical area in a relatively short span of time** (measured in hours rather than days). This distinguishes "mass murder" from [serial killing](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/#serialkiller "S"), and makes it more precise than the comparatively vague label [massacre](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/#massacre "M"). Several law enforcement agencies commonly define "mass murder" the same way, including the FBI.

**We use different language for fewer than four fatalities** (e.g., **homicide, double homicide, triple homicide**). Since most people do not routinely talk or write about quadruple homicides, quintuple homicides, etc., however, we and many other news organizations generally turn to imprecise but conversational compound nouns like "mass murder" when covering such crimes. (See [**mass shooting**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mass-shooting/ "Mass shooting") for related guidelines.)


**Murder versus murder charges**
**In news stories, generally do not describe specific killings as “murder” until there’s a verdict.** It’s normally up to the courts to determine what's a murder. **Instead, prefer the exact charges** (i.e., first- or second-degree murder). **Exceptions are deaths that are undoubtedly murder based on indisputable evidence** — such as a mass shooting or videotaped killings that are verified and unambiguous — **as well as stories about general trends**, including the RCMP's investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls ([MMIWG](/home/m#MMIWG)) in Canada. In other words, when a specific case is before the courts, it’s always OK to write that someone is accused of murdering a victim, but we usually avoid referring to the killing itself as a murder until after the verdict. The crime may turn out to be manslaughter or the accused may be acquitted. After trials end, **be aware that verdicts do not automatically govern our choice of language** when the facts are obvious. Consider the 2008 decapitation and cannibalization of a Greyhound bus passenger near Portage la Prairie, Man. The 22-year-old victim was viciously assaulted, and the fact that the accused was eventually found not criminally responsible because of mental illness does not mean it's misleading or inaccurate to describe the killing, itself, as "murder." The infamous 1955 lynching of a Black teenager in Mississippi is another example. Emmett Till was kidnapped and savagely killed hours after being accused of whistling at a white woman. Although an all-white jury acquitted two white men of homicide, Emmett Till's death, itself, can be unequivocally called "murder."

**The same principle may apply to the word "killing" versus "death," depending on the facts** (e.g., an autopsy may determine that someone died of natural causes, despite suspicious circumstances). **But when there's strong evidence of homicide** (e.g., verified cellphone video showing a suspect being beaten unconscious by police), **the term "killing" is often fine because the case usually boils down to a question of culpability rather than to a determination of "homicide."** If you have any doubts, consult your supervisor or the CBC Law Department.

In Canada, you're automatically sentenced to life in prison when convicted of either first- or second-degree murder. The major difference is the amount of time you must serve before being eligible to _apply_ for parole.

### Hong Kong

**Hong Kong**

Hong Kong is no longer a British territory. On July 1, 1997 it became **a Special Administrative Region of China**. It retains a degree of self-government with a separate, but not entirely independent, political system. Hong Kong can be described as a **semi-autonomous region** with a **limited democracy** and a **free market economy**.

It’s officially known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. But we don’t have to use the full name. **Hong Kong** is fine in first reference. **Prefer the term region** as a generic label. **Generally avoid calling it a territory**, which has echoes of its former status under British rule.

Residents are commonly known as either **Hong Kong citizens** or **Hong Kongers**. The entrenched spelling, Hong Konger, is found in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. Avoid fusing, which is comparable to writing "Novascotian" or "Newzealander." For consistency, **avoid competing demonyms like "Hongkongese."** The latter is not a local preference. For instance, the Hong Kong Public Research Institute uses "Hong Kongers" rather than "Hongkongese" in English translations of its surveys. While there's no tidy rule about suffix choices in cases like this, "-er" is found in numerous other proper nouns (e.g., Winnipegger, Londoner and New Yorker).


**Background**

Under the 1997 agreement ending a century and a half of British control, Hong Kong’s existing economic, legal and social system will be maintained for 50 years. China, however, makes decisions about defence and foreign affairs.

Hong Kong is made up of more than a dozen districts spread out over several big peninsulas and mountainous islands, as well as numerous small islands. **When reporting on Hong Kong's dense, urban centre, it's an entrenched, acceptable convention to use the word city** (e.g., "pro-democracy marches in the city," and "one of the world's wealthiest cities"), even though Hong Kong is not, technically, the name of any single municipality. **In most contexts, however, the term region is probably a better choice**, especially when referring to overall government structure — which includes a chief executive (who is the appointed head government), as well as an elected president who presides as speaker over the Hong Kong Legislative Council.

For more information, see the government of [Hong Kong’s official website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.hk%2Fen%2Fabout%2Fabouthk%2Ffacts.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw27awUpD5XISk1fvwVTtHQ-)



### House

**House versus house**

**Capitalize the generic word "house" when referring to the House of Commons in either Canada or Britain, as well as to Canadian provincial legislatures that use House in their names:**

House of Commons
the House
the Commons
House leader Cheryl Krawchuk (federal)
Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly
House leader John Bowman (provincial)

Although the Commons is also informally known as "the lower chamber" and "the lower house" (no capital letters), prefer the more widely used synonym "the House," which takes an initial cap.

The Senate is sometimes informally called "the **upper chamber**" and "the **upper house**." In daily news stories, however, generally restrict this use to directly transcribed quotes unless the meaning is immediately clear.

### Hudson Bay

**Hudson Bay versus Hudson's Bay**

**Water**
**They sailed into Hudson Bay** (_not_ Hudson’s Bay).

Use **the bay** (not “the Bay”) **in second reference**.

When referring to water, capitalize "Bay" only if used with a specific title (e.g., the Bay of Fundy).

Technically Hudson Bay is an epicontinental sea, not a bay, connected to the Atlantic Ocean by Hudson Strait and to the Arctic Ocean by Foxe Channel. But we can use “the bay” in second reference.


**Store**
**They bought blankets from the Hudson's Bay store.**

They found bargains at **the Bay**. (This is an acceptable abbreviation for the **Hudson's Bay Company** in headlines and throughout general news stories.)

For business stories, however, "**Hudson's Bay Co.**" is preferred in first reference, with either **HBC** or **the Bay** acceptable after that.

They like to shop at the **Hudson's Bay Centre**.

_Mnemonic tip_: You buy possessions from a store, not a body of water. The store (the Bay) has the possessive apostrophe (Hudson's Bay).

### Hunger strike

**Hunger strike**

There's **no single, universally accepted definition** of hunger strike.

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary describes a hunger strike as "the refusal of food as a form of protest."

**The term generally suggests no solid food, and no liquids with significant nutrition, but a broader, connotative meaning is sometimes acceptable.** Historically, some famous hunger strikers have also consumed salt, sugar and vitamins to prolong their lives.

When covering these protests, **it's helpful to report specific detail to put a given hunger strike in context**. For instance, "She has been living on water, tea, vitamins and fish broth for the past six weeks."

Descriptions such as "consuming only liquids" are OK when accurate. But since they can imply juice and other drinks, it's normally better to specify known details. **Avoid awkward constructions such as "liquids-only diet,"** especially in broadcast scripts.

If protesters are ingesting puréed soups and other blended food with significant nutritional content, they are not on a hunger strike. Their bodies may hunger for solid food they're accustomed to, but that's not the same thing.

Prolonged hunger strikes can put the lives of the protesters at stake, even when they're consuming a bit of broth and vitamins. When there's room in stories, it's helpful to supply this context by interviewing doctors or other medical personnel.

**The verb "fast" has a range of meanings.** It can refer to abstaining from all or merely from some kinds of food and drink. **"Fasting"** is commonly tied to religious observances or preparations for medical procedures.

### Hydro versus power

**Hydro versus power**

"Hydro" means "electricity" in some parts of Canada (hydro bills, hydro poles, hydro lines). It's short for hydroelectricity — energy generated by turbines powered by moving water (also known as hydro power).

**Since hydro is a regionalism, using it in stories in certain parts of the country jolts some people.** They either aren't familiar with the word in that context or consider it inaccurate because most of their electricity comes from a source other than water (e.g., coal-fired plants). They're quick to point that while all hydro poles are power poles not all power poles are hydro poles.

**If you're sure hydro is the correct regionalism** (e.g., Quebec and Ontario), **use the word without hesitation. But if you're referring to another part of the country in your story, check first.** Don't automatically rewrite the local term (e.g., "power pole") simply because you're more familiar with the word "hydro."

**TIP:** Unlike "hydro," the generic word "power" and the specific term "electricity" and its derivatives (e.g., "electrical") are accurate and well-known across the country ("The car hit a power pole" and "The apartment had no electricity"). The term "utility" is broader than power, covering cable and phone lines as well (e.g., a "utility pole").

**I** 

**[i-im](/home/i#i)**

**ice bucket, ice cap, ice-cold** (adj.), **ice cube, icefield, ice jam, ice pack, ice pick, ice storm, ice water** (two words)

**ice cream, ice-cream cone, ice-cream bar**

**ice floe** (_avoid_ redundant expression) A floe by definition is a sheet of floating ice

**iced tea** (_not_ ice tea)

**ID** (identification, identity), as in _an ID card_; **ID'd** (in headlines and transcribed quotes; otherwise, prefer identified)

**Idaho** (no abbreviation) See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**idiosyncrasy**

**i.e.** (prefer "that is" to abbreviated Latin "id est" in news stories) See [**e.g. and i.e.**](/home/e/eg-and-ie)

**IED** (improvised explosive device) Since not everyone knows this military term, it's best to spell out once high in the story. The abbreviation does not need to appear in brackets after the words but can simply be used in subsequent references. Instead of using IED in headlines, generally prefer the term **bomb** since it's equally accurate but more meaningful to a larger audience. While all IEDs are **makeshift bombs**, they're not all **roadside bombs**. It depends where they're placed. Check the story's facts. The term **booby trap** is OK to describe IEDs in buildings, vehicles, etc., rigged to explode.

**iftar** (meal eaten after sunset by Muslims observing Ramadan fasting) There are several spellings. For consistency, use this entrenched transliteration. (See also [suhoor](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/#suhoor "S"))

**Ikea** (not IKEA) See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization)

**Îles-de-la-Madeleine** (Official French name for the [**Magdalen Islands**](/home/m#Magdalen_Islands)) Either noun is OK in our journalism. But CBC News management in Quebec recommends **Magdalen Islands** in most cases because it's the most common version used by the province's anglophones. See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for related guidelines.

**ill, ill feeling, ill will;** _but_ **ill-fated, ill-mannered, ill-starred**

**Imax** (_not_ IMAX) A [trade name](/home/t/trade-names) for movies shown on huge screens.

imbedded (_always use_ **embedded**)

**imitator** (_not_ -er)

**immigrant** (someone who moves to a place) While immigrant often implies that someone is a relative newcomer to a country, it can also be used in historical contexts (e.g., a person's grandparents were immigrants). Be aware that **immigrants to** a place (e.g., Canada) can also be viewed as **emigrants from** a place (e.g., Germany, Jamaica or Japan). See also [migrant workers](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/migrant_foreign_worker/ "Migrant_foreign_worker") (OK when facts fit), as well [illegal immigrant](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/illegal_immigration/ "Illegal_immigration") (a term considered demonizing by some).

**immigrant languages** (a once-common expression that's now considered problematic) **Generally AVOID** outside of direct attribution, such as transcribed clips or quoted documents. Instead, be specific (e.g., Asian languages, African languages, European languages), or frame the detail in the context of a country's overall population (e.g., **minority languages, non-dominant languages**), depending on the facts. In Canada's case, for example, English and French might be viewed as "immigrant languages" from an Indigenous community's standpoint. While it's OK to use the label **official languages** when referring to **English and French in Canada**, be sure its meaning is clear within a given story (e.g., in a public policy debate over language protection). The same applies to the expression "non-official languages."

**inauguration, inauguration day** (lowercase)

**inadmissible** (_not_ -able)

**inadvertent** (_not_ -ant)

**incel** (lowercase term coined in the 1990s) Slang for "involuntary celibate" ideology, a misogynistic subculture that began online and remained relatively obscure until being linked to cases of violence and murder in the mid-2010s. Requires a brief definition in stories (e.g., "Members of the group commonly express exasperation over their inability to find a romantic or sexual partner, sometimes blaming women").

****indict, indictable****

**Indigenous** (adj.), **Indigenous people** (See [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) for details, including an overview of the terms Indian, non-status Indian, Inuit and Métis).

**infographics** (one word)

**inform** (verb) In his classic book _Usage and Abusage_ : _A Guide to Good English_, Eric Patridge calls the verb inform "officialese ... to be avoided." It's good advice. In many cases, "inform" is overly formal. It can also lead to roundabout, confusing constructions (e.g., "City council hopes future developments will be informed by the principles of ..."). When we mean passing along information, generally prefer more conversational alternatives, such as "tell." When we mean affecting the foundation of something (e.g., "Religion informs all aspects of their lives"), pick less bureaucratic alternatives, such as "shapes" or "influences."

It's generally helpful to define it once high in a story (e.g., "the international police agency Interpol"). There's no need to spell out the formal name: "the International Criminal Police Organization."

**interpretive** (adj.) Generally prefer over **interpretative**, which is less conversational. Both words have the same meaning. Some commentators insist that interpretative is better aligned with its Latin roots. But interpretive is more common in Canada and equally correct.

**Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami** ("_Inuit are united in Canada_") This national Inuit organization was originally called "Inuit Tapirisat" when it was founded in 1971. The group changed its name in 2001.

**inukshuk** (the figure of a person made out of stones) The [Inuktut](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/inuktut/ "Inuktut") word means "like a human." Because of conventional pronunciation in English Canada, CBC News does not use the alternative spelling (inuksuk) common in Nunavut. We also prefer the entrenched English plural **inukshuks** over the relatively obscure forms "inuksugait" or "inuksuit." The Canadian Oxford Dictionary and Nunavut's Inuktitut Living Dictionary both list inukshuk as the primary English spelling as well. (See [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) for related background and guidelines)

**Investment Canada Act** (legislation) There's no such organization or agency called "Investment Canada." A federal ministry (**Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada**, formerly known as Industry Canada) is in charge of administering most parts of the act, although the **Department of Canadian Heritage** handles cultural businesses such as publishing, music and film. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has an investment review division. Its staff are sometimes informally called "Investment Canada officials" because they're experts on the Investment Canada Act. But in stories, don't refer to "Investment Canada" as a body. It doesn't exist. See also **[Ministry](/home/m/ministry)** for related guidelines, such as distinguishing between "legal names" that are technically still on the books (e.g., the Department of Industry), and "applied titles" that are preferred in our journalism.

**Iraqi Governing Council** (formed in July 2003 but eventually replaced by an elected government) The council was an interim body made up of about two dozen people chosen by the U.S. to lead Iraq until elections could be held. Iraq's current parliament is known as the Council of Representatives. (See also [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies))

**Iraqi Kurdistan** (also known as the **Kurdistan region of Iraq**) A section of northern Iraq , recognized in the country's constitution, that's run by a Kurdish regional government. Never use the bald noun "Kurdistan," which wrongly implies a separate state. (See [**Kurdistan**](/home/k#Kurdistan))

[**Ireland, the Republic of**](/home/i/ireland) (Do not confuse this country with the province of Northern Ireland)

**iridescent** (_not_ irr-)

**Irish Republic** (formally known as the [Republic of Ireland](/home/i/ireland)) Either noun is OK, but do not confuse this country with the province of Northern Ireland.

Just as "must of" for "must have" is illiterate, "irregardless" is widely condemned as a faulty formation. _Use_ **regardless** or **irrespective** _instead_.

**ISIS** (**Islamic State in Iraq and Syria**) A Sunni jihadist organization formed in 2013. OK to describe as an al-Qaeda splinter group. Prefer ISIS over the alternative name "ISIL." The acronym's last letter is open to interpretation because the Arabic word "al-Sham" can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus. ISIS does not need to be spelled out in all stories as long as the abbreviation is at least broadly defined for our audience (e.g., militants fighting to establish an [Islamist](/home/i/islam#islamicist) state). Although the group shortened its name to IS ("Islamic State") at the end of June 2014, we continue to use ISIS for reasons outlined in this [July 2 (2014) style ruling](/updates/2014/2014-07-02). **ISIS-K** is a self-declared branch of ISIS formed in Afghanistan in late 2014 by disgruntled Pakistani and Afghan Taliban fighters who said they wanted to be part of a more extreme group. The "K" stands for the historical Khorasan region, which encompasses large parts of Central and South Asia. There's no need to spell out "K," but the group should be briefly explained/defined in stories whenever practical. Avoid alternative names, such as ISIS-KP (for "Khorasan Province"), ISKP, etc.

**Islam** (n.), **Islamic** (adj.) See [**Islam**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/islam/ "Islam") for related terms, including caveats about the words Islamicist and **Islamist**.

**island** in generic contexts, but **Prince Edward Island, Vancouver Island**, and **the Island** (a colloquial term for either body of land)

**Israel Defence Forces** (**IDF** is fine in second reference) Use the spelling "Defence" rather than "Defense" for reasons outlined in our [defence, labour and centre overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre/ "Defence labour and centre").

**IT** (Fine in headlines, but this abbreviation for "**information technology**" must be spelled out high up in the story. Use lowercase letters when defining the term.) See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations#whenandhow) for general guidelines

"**It Boy**" and "**It Girl**" (quotation marks and initial capital letters), as in: _Jane Smith, the "It Girl" of the festival, laughed at the suggestion_, and _There's no doubt Anderson is the new "It Boy" of hip-hop_. The capital letters flag the term as a colloquial [nickname](/home/n/nicknames), while the quotation marks convey the sense of "so-called." Do not emphasize the word "It" with full capitalization, since IT is the common abbreviation for information technology, as in: _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was the "It Girl" of IT last year_. See also [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for general guidelines, including why "It Boy" becomes 'It Boy' in headlines or transcribed speech.

[**italics**](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) (general guidelines)

**Ithaca, Greece** (not "Ithaki," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**iTunes** (See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

**Ivory Coast** (_not_ République de Côte d'Ivoire) Always use conventional English versions of foreign countries' names. See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#geographicalabroad) for more details. Citizens are **Ivorians**. The capital is Abidjan. Do _not_ add the definite article [the](/home/t/the-versus-the) (i.e., refer to Ivory Coast rather than to "the" Ivory Coast, just as we report on Ukraine rather than on "the" Ukraine). See also [country names](/home/g/geography-cities)

**Ivy League** (This term has a narrow meaning. It refers only to the following eight campuses in the eastern United States: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University.) So places such as Stanford and Berkeley may have prestige, but they're _not_ Ivy League schools.

### I versus me

**I versus me**

**The personal pronouns _I_ and me are relatively straightforward. But there are a few pitfalls**, outlined after the brief review of subjective and objective forms below.

['Between you and me'](/home/i/i-versus-me#prepositions) (prepositions can confuse) 

**Subjective versus objective forms**
**"I" is known as a subjective** (sometimes called nominative) **pronoun. This simply means that it's the subject of the sentence's verb**, such as _walk_ below. (Who did the walking? "I" did.)


> **I** walked past him.


**"Me" is known as an objective** (sometimes called accusative) **pronoun. This simply means that it's the object of the sentence's verb**, such as _ran_ below.


> She ran past **me**.
>

**Subjective**

**Objective**

I

me

you

you

he

him

she

her

it

it

we

us

they

them


NOTE: The terms _subjective_ and _objective_ are generally preferred in modern discussions of English grammar, since the old Latin labels _nominative_ and _accusative_ have extra meanings normally reserved for other languages. For instance, _accusative_ refers to the indirect object of a verb (e.g., "mich" in German), while _dative_ refers to the direct objective of a verb (e.g., "mir" in German). In English, however, there's no difference between direct and indirect objectives of a verb (e.g., "mich" and "mir" both mean "me"). The personal pronoun "me," therefore, is labelled objective in all cases.


**Where's the verb?**
**If a pronoun appears before a verb, it takes the subjective form.**


> Betty and **I** (not _me_) **received** free copies.


When in doubt, substitute another pronoun to see whether the correct form is subjective ("I") or objective ("me").


> **He** (not _him_) and Betty **received** free copies.


**'Between you and me'** (prepositions can confuse)
**When the pronoun in question appears after a preposition** (e.g., _from, to, between, before, with, against_), **it takes the objective form.**

Most people pick the right word automatically when there's only one pronoun:


> They'll be hearing **from me** (not _from I_).
>
> I'll be hearing **from them** (not _from they_)


**Confusion sometimes arises when more than one pronoun appears after the preposition. The rule is the same, however**, no matter how many pronouns are in a cluster. Simply use the objective form after a preposition governing the pronoun(s) in question:


> **Wrong**
>
> Between you and I, they can't dance.
>
> They gave free copies to Betty and I.
>
> **Correct (objective from after the preposition)**
>
> **Between you and me**, they can't dance.
>
> They gave free copies **to Betty and me**.


What's behind this common mistake? Grammarians think writers become accustomed to a cluster of subjective pronouns before verbs (e.g., "You and I danced," "Betty and I cried"), and automatically retain the subjective form when confronted by other strings of pronouns. **TIP: To avoid the error, always consider whether a given pronoun appears _before_ a verb or _after_ a preposition.**

**Axe words you don't need**
**Sometimes sentences are shorter and more natural when certain prepositions and pronouns are deleted.** Get rid of anything unnecessary.


> **Correct (BUT wordy and awkward)
> **
>
> Many of us (not _we_) voters are fed up with broken promises.
>
> Few among them (not _they_) inside agreed to talk.
>
> **Better (with prepositions/pronouns cut)**
>
> **Many voters** are fed up with broken promises
>
> **Few inside** agreed to talk.


**In other cases, keeping the preposition but combining two pronouns into one** (e.g., "him and me" = "us") **is the best solution.**


> **Correct (BUT wordy and awkward)**
>
> For him and me, the library was more fun than the amusement park.
>
> **Better (with a plural pronoun replacing him and me)**
>
> **For us**, the library was more fun than the amusement park.


**'More than I/me'**
**If "than" is used as a conjunction** (i.e., as a connecting word such as _and_ or _but_) **to introduce a full clause** (i.e., a group of words with its own subject and verb), **use the subjective form** (e.g., _he_ or _I_).


> Bob's dog weighs **more than I** do.
>
> They liked the film **more than he** did.


**TIP:** When the verb is dropped and "than" is treated as a preposition, it's widely acceptable to use the objective form (e.g., him or me):


> **Technically correct but overly formal**
>
> Bob's dog weighs more than I.
>
> They went to the zoo more than he.
>
> **OK as long as the meaning is unambiguous**
>
> Bob's dog weighs **more than me.**
>
> They went to the zoo **more than him.**


**WARNING:** "More than" comparisons can be tricky, and **the choice of a personal pronoun sometimes changes a sentence's meaning:**


> "She loves cake more than I" means she loves cake more than I do.
>
> "She loves cake more than me" means she loves cake more than she loves me.


**Make certain there's no ambiguity. If something is unclear, recast accordingly.** This often involves reintroducing the dropped verb: "She loves cake more than I do."


**'It is I/me'**
For years, grammarians have insisted on the subjective form (e.g., _I_) of any pronoun that's linked to a "to be" verb (e.g., is, are, was), even if the pronoun comes after this verb.

> **Grammatical but very formal**
>
> It is I. (It is I who called.)
>
> That is he. (That is he in the police lineup.)


But **in a triumph of conversational English over unnecessarily stilted structure, the objective form is now considered perfectly acceptable after a "to be" verb:
**

> **OK and far more common and natural**
>
> It is me.
>
> That's him, officers.


Some traditionalists dismiss this more colloquial approach as ungrammatical. Since it's wrong to write "Me is it" or "Him is the one," they argue that it's equally wrong to put the objective form (e.g., "me" or "him") later in the same sentence.

**If you're uncomfortable with the correct but highly formal construction** (e.g., "It is I"), **but want to avoid criticism from some quarters for the informal and sometimes disputed version** (e.g., "It is me"), **simply recast the sentence** with the subjective form of the pronoun before the verb:


> **I am** the person.
>
> **He's** the one, officers.

**In fact, a lot of roundabout writing can be improved by using a different pronoun at the start.** When a sentence begins with what amounts to a "false subject" (e.g., "It was ..." or "There are ..."), moving the displaced or "real" subject to the beginning produces a shorter and clearer construction:


> **She was** rescued (rather than, "It was she who was rescued").
>
> **He jogged** with her (rather than, "It is she whom he jogged with").
>
> **I flew** over them (rather than, "It is they whom I flew over").
>
> **Some buildings have** only one exit (rather than "There are some buildings that ...").

### illegal\_immigration

**Illegal immigration, illegal immigrant**

The term **illegal immigration** broadly refers to the act of entering or living in a country without legal authority. The term **illegal immigrant** conventionally describes a person who enters or lives in a country without legal authority.

While both compounds are common, **be aware that some object to the term illegal immigrant.** They say it wrongly labels people as "illegal," rather than identifying the unsanctioned acts they're accused of as illegal (e.g., crossing a border or living in a country without permission). For this reason, AP banned the wording in 2013.

**We do not automatically prohibit use of "illegal immigrant."** The same approach is taken by several other news organizations, including the New York Times and the BBC. The compound illegal immigrant, coined in the 1930s, is clear and entrenched. The construction is also standard English. For instance, a motorist without a licence is an unlicenced driver, an unlawful driver, an illegal driver (emphasis on person), as well as a motorist who is driving without a licence or who is driving illegally (emphasis on action).

**But when describing people** rather than acts, **the shorthand "illegal immigrant" is often not the best choice. Alternatives can be considered when deemed appropriate** (e.g., **undocumented worker)**, although certain language may be too confusing or bureaucratic to serve our audience well (e.g., "unauthorized alien"). Use your judgment. **Details about people can also provide valuable context to our coverage** — from how specific individuals entered the country (e.g., overstaying a visa versus crossing a border without valid papers), to where they are from, where they have been living and working, whether they have children, and whether the children have any special legal residency status because of their age or circumstances.

**Never shorten the modifier "illegal" to a noun on its own** (e.g., avoid wording such as "an illegal" or "thousands of illegals").

### Immaculate Conception

**Immaculate Conception**

This is a label used for Mary’s conception, _not_ the virgin conception of Jesus.

It refers to the Catholic belief that Mary was conceived free from original sin, and so was absolutely sinless throughout her life.

### immunization, vaccination

**Immunization, inoculation, vaccination**

**These words are often treated as synonyms. There are sometimes subtle differences worth noting in certain news stories** — especially when a distinction is being made between live and dead organisms, or between a body's natural immune system and artificial treatments. **In general, however, it's perfectly acceptable to describe a _vaccination_ as an _inoculation_. They're both forms of _immunization_.** 


[vaccination](/home/i/immunization-vaccination#vaccines) (including vaccine names, terminology)


**Immunization (n), immunize (v.)**
This is the **broadest category** of the three. Immunization **simply refers to a natural or artificial process of rendering a person or animal immune to an illness.** The body may do this on its own or through a vaccination or other type of inoculation. By definition, then, **vaccination and inoculation are both forms of immunization.**


**Inoculation (n.), inoculant (n.), inoculate (v.)**
Inoculating involves **intentionally exposing a person or animal to a disease-causing agent to try to make them immune. Inoculants may or may not contain live organisms** — which is the main distinction that some epidemiologists make between inoculation and vaccination. The goal is to induce a mild case of a particular illness before a person is actually infected with a fully potent form.

When referring to specific substances, prefer the word inoculant (plural, inoculants) over _inoculum_ (plural _inocula_).



**Vaccination (n.), vaccine (n.), vaccinate (v.)**
**A vaccination is a common type of inoculation.** The goal is to stimulate the production of antibodies. Vaccinations **traditionally contained dead or modified (weakened) organisms**. In recent decades, however, **a new process has been developed using "messenger RNA" (mRNA) technology** that essentially tricks the body into neutralizing a given pathogen's threat by learning how to deal with the virus's unique protein coating. Most vaccines are still injected rather than swallowed because they lose effectiveness after passing through the digestive system. But needle-free options are sometimes available (e.g., nasal spray and skin patches). **Be aware that some vaccines require more than one dose to be effective, and that logistical hurdles can hamper rollouts** (e.g., production costs and temperature storage requirements).


**Vaccine names, terminology**
**Be clear and accurate when referring to vaccine names.** If they've been jointly developed by two or more companies, generally acknowledge this at least once in first reference (e.g., the **Pfizer-BioNTech** vaccine rather than just the "Pfizer vaccine," and **Oxford-AstraZeneca** rather than just "AstraZeneca"). However, there's **no need to adopt unnecessarily dense proper nouns when one company is owned by another** (e.g., in COVID-19 coverage, the **Johnson & Johnson vaccine** became a common and acceptable name for the **Janssen vaccine**, since Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. is actually a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson). NOTE: **In HEADLINES, it's OK to use only one name** (Pfizer) or to lean on recognizable abbreviations (J&L) because of space constraints.

**Sometimes rebranding occurs.** During the summer of 2021, for example, three companies introduced new names for their COVID-19 vaccines. **Using such rebrandings is optional and depends in part on how widely they're adopted.** One gauge is whether public health authorities embrace the names. **Until new proper nouns become common, it's important to add brief definitions or explanations** so our audience knows what we're talking about:


> **Comirnaty** (from Pfizer-BioNTech)
>
> **Spikevax** (from Moderna)
>
> **Vaxzevria** (from Oxford-AstraZeneca)


**Be precise when using terminology by regulators and other public health officials when generic usage might cause confusion.** In the U.S., for example, the FDA distinguishes between the nouns "**authorization**" and "**approval**," as well as between the related verbs ("**authorize**" and "**approve**"). The former (authorization) applies to "emergency use" during a public health crisis, such as a pandemic, while the latter (approval) applies to the everyday process of collecting and assessing data from routine trials of drugs and other medical treatments. **Since many in our audience will not be familiar with these narrow distinctions, it's generally best to add a relevant modifier** (e.g., "emergency") **to the story when applicable** to underscore the difference (e.g., "**emergency authorization**" versus routine "approval").

The term **"unvaccinated" conventionally refers to people who have not been given any vaccination** against a specific disease. To avoid ambiguity, **use modifiers such as "partially" and "fully" when reporting on vaccinations requiring more than one dose** (e.g., "fully vaccinated against COVID-19"). The level of protection a given individual has after being vaccinated depends in part on the vaccine, the person's immune system, the virulence of mutating virus strains and the passage of time. **Keep in mind that booster shots are sometimes needed** to maintain protection against various diseases (e.g., tetanus and diphtheria but not polio). **Differentiate between booster shots** for the general population long after the initial vaccines are administered **and ordinal dosages administered during the initial vaccination period** (i.e., second doses, third doses). In a nutshell, **the expression "booster shot" conventionally refers to "revaccination" rather than to supplementary initial doses.** During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, some Canadians were advised to get "third doses" (also known as "additional doses") by public health authorities because they had compromised immunize systems. Calling these third doses "booster shots" was confusing and technically inaccurate, the experts said.

### impaired\_driving

**Impaired driving, not DUI**

**Avoid the U.S.-based term DUI** ("driving under the influence") **when referring to allegations against motorists in Canada**, specific charges laid in Canada, etc. **Even in generic contexts, the Canadian expression impaired driving is usually preferred** (e.g., "His driving skills were so poor he appeared to be in a constant state of impairment" rather than "His driving skills were so poor he appeared to be in a constant DUI state").

**Reserve DUI for specific U.S. contexts**, such as charges laid south of the border.

The compound "impaired driving" was coined around 1950, when the Criminal Code of Canada was amended to include the new offence, according to the 1967 Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles. The first impaired driver convicted under the new law was an Ontario man who paid a fine of $50 in July 1951.

[BIPOC](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/indigenous/#racialized "Indigenous") (generally avoid unless attributed; prefer 'racialized' if broad phrasing is needed)

**Indigenous** (recommended umbrella term)
Technically, the uppercase adjectives **Indigenous and Aboriginal** can be used to **refer to all First Nations people** (status and non-status Indians), **Inuit and Métis in Canada.** Although the word Aboriginal still surfaces from time to time, **Indigenous is now preferred in virtually all cases**, outside of verbatim quotes and the occasional proper nouns.

> _Indigenous_ people
>
> _Indigenous_ rights
>
> _Indigenous_ groups
>
> _Indigenous_ leaders
>
> _Indigenous_ [band](/home/i/Indigenous#singular) councils
>
> _Indigenous_ self-government
>
> _non-Indigenous_ fishermen

CBC News adopted capitalized forms (Indigenous, Aboriginal) in the spring of 2016 because the terms have become the equivalent of "proper noun modifiers" describing people, language and culture. One year later, some other Canadian news services followed suit, including CP. **Use lowercase forms only for generic wording unrelated to Indigenous people** (e.g., indigenous plants, native wildlife).


**Ensure detail is relevant**
**Avoid identifying someone as Indigenous unless the detail is relevant to the story.** For example, do not refer to "an Indigenous doctor" or "an Aboriginal man" solely because we know this detail. **A helpful test is whether you would write "white" or "female" instead of "Indigenous" or "Aboriginal" in parallel coverage involving different facts.** If not, leave out the adjective.

When pertinent, it's OK to refer to an Indigenous person's ancestry. But **prefer specific detail** (e.g., Cree, [Mi'kmaw](/home/m/mi-kmaq)) **over catch-all labels** (e.g., Indigenous) **whenever possible**, especially when referring to individuals.

> Skookum is a _Chinook_ word for impressive.
>
> It's a _Blackfoot_ custom.
>
> Two _Nisga'a_ First Nation elders want the B.C. Court of Appeal to strike down the landmark treaty.



**Indigeneity** **(Indigenous identity)**
The term **Indigeneity broadly refers to the distinct identities of Indigenous Peoples** around the world. It's commonly used by anthropologists and other academics differentiating between hundreds of millions of people who are Indigenous and billions who are non-Indigenous. In our journalism, **questions about Indigeneity primarily arise when there are disputes over whether individuals are members of a specific Indigenous community** (e.g., if they are Inuit, if they are Métis, if they are Algonquin). **Such disagreements can have sweeping consequences** over everything from community sovereignty to potential land claims as well as access to resources and government grants.


There's **no succinct, universal definition of Indigenous people** for reasons outlined on p. 6 of a [2013 UN background manual](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/lxkat5s5/un_indigenousrightsdeclarationmanual_2013.pdf "UN Indigenousrightsdeclarationmanual 2013") about the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples:

_"Indigenous Peoples have argued against the adoption of a formal definition at the international level, stressing the need for flexibility and for respecting the desire and the right of each Indigenous people to define themselves…. As a consequence, no formal definition has been adopted in international law. A strict definition is seen as unnecessary and undesirable."_

Instead, **two broad principles provide direction.** The first is **self-identification** (i.e., individuals say they're Indigenous). The second is **acceptance of this identification by the specified Indigenous population**, as outlined in paragraph 381 of [Chapter 22 of the final 1983 UN report on the Study of the Problem of Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/fbznvwko/indigeneity_un_easc_documents_mcstudy_xxi_xxii_1983_e.pdf "Indigeneity UN EASC Documents Mcstudy Xxi Xxii 1983 E") (p. 51).

Given the above, CBC journalists are encouraged to:

-   **Include attribution if someone's Indigenous identity is in dispute** (e.g., "She says she's Indigenous") as well as the reasons others contest the stated Indigeneity.
-   **Be specific about known or claimed Indigeneity at least once in a story** in order to help our audience understand the full picture (e.g., point out that someone says they're Algonquin or Mi'kmaw, rather than merely relying on the generic term Indigenous).
-   **Be balanced and fair**, distinguishing between what amounts to a disagreement between individuals (e.g., two university professors arguing over heritage) and something on a larger scale. In the latter case, **always give suitable weight** (prominence) **to statements by leaders of the Indigenous community in question**, in accordance with the UN criterion of "acceptance by the population" cited above.

In Canada, **be aware that Métis Indigeneity is at the heart of some disputes, and that it's important to present relevant background whenever practical.** For example, here's how context about an agreement between the federal government and the Métis Nation of Ontario has been presented in past CBCNews.ca coverage:

_"The Métis National Council has long said the only people who can rightfully claim to be Métis are those who are accepted by the larger community.... This definition excludes people who live east of Ontario, or those who cannot trace their roots back to an ancestor descended from a mixed European and First Nations marriage, in this area, from the 1700s onwards. But others, including the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, have said that definition is too restrictive."_

**KEY TAKEAWAY: CBC News is not the arbiter of whether some people in Ontario have the right to call themselves Métis** in stories about deals negotiated with Ottawa. **Instead, our role is to report all relevant facts, including opposition or concerns** that a group such as the Métis National Council may express about claimed Indigeneity.

**The same approach should be taken with a group such as the NunatuKavut Community Council (NCC)**, which says it represents about 6,000 Inuit in south and central Labrador. The NCC was founded in 1981 as the Labrador Métis Nation but then changed its name to NunatuKavut in 2010, saying the latter better reflected its members' heritage. However, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, (ITK) which calls itself as "the national representative organization" for all Inuit in Canada, has rejected the NCC's stance as a separate Inuit body. It also disputes NunatuKavut claims of Inuit identity. **In coverage of the NCC, the ITK's position should be mentioned.** In routine stories about specific NunatuKavut people, such as a profile of a scholar or artist, use wording that's clear but respectful (e.g., instead of automatically relying on attribution, such as "who says he's Indigenous," point out that the Inuit identity of NCC members is contested by the ITK).

**Note that the word pretendian should be treated with the same caution and consideration as the word it is based on.** [See guidance considerations specific to pretendian](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-06-03-pretendian/ "2025 06 03 - Pretendian").

See also [racialized](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/racial-terms/#umbrella-terms "Racial terms") for important caveats about BIPOC, and why an expression such as "people of colour" should never be confused with Indigenous identity. 

**Use Indigenous spellings of proper nouns**
Our default style is to **match the spellings of proper nouns used by Indigenous people and communities**, themselves, such as the **Kwanlin Dün First Nation** and the **Union of Nova Scotia [Mi'kmaq](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mi-kmaq/ "Mi kmaq")**.

If people share their traditional names with us, these names should take precedence over English forms. This often means that the traditional name (e.g., **Wet'suwet'en Hereditary Chief Na'Moks**) would be used throughout a given story (**Na'Moks** in second reference), with the non-traditional name appearing once in brackets (**John Ridsdale**). Exceptions are cases when people choose to incorporate traditional names into non-traditional names (e.g., **Rainbow Akohserákwas Jacobs** becomes **Jacobs** in second reference). Respect individual preferences. In cases when the meaning of a traditional name is pertinent, specify the language being translated, and generally use the English version only once. For instance, if we report that **Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe** is Ojibway for **Buffalo Woman**, we should continue to use Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe in second and subsequent references. **Pîhtokahanapiwiyin** (the Cree name of **Chief Poundmaker**) is another example.

In geographical locations, we generally include initial capital letters to help our audience recognize the proper noun, even if lowercase lettering is used in the Indigenous language (e.g., **Kikiskitotawânawak Iskwêwak Lakes** in Saskatchewan). This makes scanning easier and eliminates the need to render lowercase non-English words in italics, along the lines of how we handle certain [French proper nouns](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/f/french-words-and-accents/#capitalization "French words and accents").

While our spellings of cities, towns, lakes, etc., normally conform to decisions made by the Geographical Names Board of Canada (GNBC), there are exceptions, including when we think an entry in the board's database is contradictory or outmoded. For instance, in early 2023 the GNBC still listed the **Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke** living on a First Nation in Quebec called "Kahnawake" instead of [**Kahnawà:ke**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/k/#Kahnawake "K"), which is our style. **Leave out provincial or territorial locators when referring to First Nations territory** (e.g., do not put "Que." after Kahnawà:ke, the way you'd write Trois-Rivières, Que.). When geographical detail is needed for the benefit of a wider audience, lean toward alternative phrasing to help pinpoint places (e.g., **Kahnawà:ke** and **Manawan** are **among several First Nation in Quebec** advocating for better policing, and the **Peguis First Nation** is about 200 kilometres **north of Winnipeg**).

NOTE: The [federal government's geographical names database](https://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/search-place-names/search) is reviewed and revised by the GNBC based on recommendations by provincial and territorial representatives. Its website includes background on what it says are roughly 30,000 [Indigenous place names](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/indigenous-place-names/19739) across the country. In 2020, for example, Yukon's **Mount Higgins** was officially changed to the traditional Tetlit Gwich'in name of **Jùuk'an**. Just because a GNBC entry does not currently include accents in a proper noun, do not assume that this is the preference of a given Indigenous community. Instead, check the local source (e.g., a First Nation website, a tribal council directory).

**Strive to reflect Indigenous phonetics**
Although we report in English, we should try our best to reflect the **traditional pronunciation** of names and related words used by Indigenous people. **Be aware that vowel and consonant sounds, as well as syllabic stress, can vary widely** because of regional dialects.

For consistency on air, **reporters should include phonetics in broadcast scripts if the pronunciation is not already obvious**. Sometimes such spelled-out guidance is needed only during initial coverage (e.g., when some islands off Canada's West Coast were officially renamed **Haida Gwaii** in 2010, to reflect the original name used by local Indigenous people, broadcast scripts often included the phonetic "HEYE-dah GWEYE" in brackets until the proper noun became widely known).

**It can also be worthwhile to include phonetics in certain web journalism** to help our English-speaking audience learn how to pronounce unfamiliar text.

EXAMPLE 1: **Kanien’kéha** (GAH-NYEN-GEH-HAH) is the traditional name of the Mohawk language, as noted in the CBC Indigenous feature, [Original Voices](https://www.cbc.ca/originalvoices/language/kanienkeha/).

EXAMPLE 2: In 2018, a public square in front of Vancouver's Queen Elizabeth Theatre was renamed **šxʷƛ̓exən Xwtl'a7shn** (SHWOO'-t'lah-ken HOOT'-AW'-shun). The proper noun combines two First Nation languages (**Hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓** and **Sḵwx̱wú7mesh**, respectively), spoken by three communities (the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh nations), and is translated as "a place one is invited to," and "a place where one is invited to celebrate."

The phonetic for **šxʷƛ̓exən Xwtl'a7shn** comes from carefully listening to First Nation people saying the words in this [3-minute video produced by the City of Vancouver](/media/1i5f2lp0/%C5%A1x%CA%B7%C6%9B-ex%C9%99n-xwtl-a7shn_renamed-vancouver-plaza_2018.mp4). Since various symbols and diacritical markings convey specific sounds in the spellings — such as the "7," which is a glottal stop, as in "uh" — it can be a good practice to add additional detail to avoid ambiguity in the English phonetic. For instance, the CBC's chief pronunciation counsellor Laura Carlin has suggested the following tips for our phonetics here, based on a review of Indigenous community members saying the words as well as consultation with veteran broadcasters: 

**šxʷƛ̓exən** (SHWOO'-t'lah-ken)  — _The first syllable is very breathy. It's not like "shoe" but more like you're starting a whistle._
**Xwtl'a7shn** (HOOT'-AW'-shun)  — _The first syllable begins with a very breathy "H," almost like you're blowing out a candle._

**Bear in mind that phonetics can sometimes be very challenging**, depending on the original language. So **the goal is to come up with something that reasonably approximates the sound of the Indigenous proper noun or phrase** using the roman alphabet.  For consistency when spelling out sounds from any language, the [CBC Phonetics Guide](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/521ind0l/cbc-phonetics-legend_september-2017.pdf "CBC PHONETICS LEGEND_September-2017.pdf") is recommended.

Please remember that phonetics are pronunciation aids only, and should not be turned into modern [transliterations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transliterations/ "Transliterations") (i.e., English forms of the Indigenous names and words). Dozens of now entrenched English words have their roots in various Indigenous languages (e.g., **canoe, hammock, igloo, kayak, raccoon, toboggan**). Today, the original words are generally flagged with italics when cited in our journalism (e.g., **saskatoon berry** comes from the Cree word **_misâskwatômin_**). 

**Generally avoid 'Native,' plus other caveats**
**The term "Native" is largely outdated** as a synonym for Indigenous **in Canada and should be reserved for rare historical references** (e.g., directly quoting from the 1999 landmark Supreme Court decision on Indigenous fishing rights). Be aware, however, that **Native remains a common and acceptable term in some other parts of the world**, including in the U.S. (e.g., a **Native American**, and the **Native American Rights Fund**). While it's OK to use a group or individual's language of choice in these cases, **it can sometimes be preferable to paraphrase with wording more familiar to our audience** (e.g., referring to a U.S. citizen as an Indigenous artist or as an Indigenous rights lawyer). Use your judgment. **Whenever practical, specific detail should be included at some point in the story**  (e.g., a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota). 

**Avoid using Aboriginal or Native as nouns** (e.g., Do **not** write about "Aboriginals" suing the province or about "a Native" found frozen to death).


**Avoid the clipped forms "Abo" and "Abos,"** which are classified as offensive slang by the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

See also: [residential schools](/home/r/residential-schools) and Canada's [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](/home/t/trc)


**Capitalize foreign coverage too**
For consistency, treat "Aboriginal" and "Native" as proper noun equivalents when referring to other countries' Indigenous populations, such as Native Americans (U.S.) and Aboriginal people or Aborigines (Australia):

> In 2014, she became the first Native American woman appointed to the federal court.
>
> In 1970, Australia abandoned decades of assimilation policies and stopped forcibly removing Aboriginal people from their families.
>
> During such rituals, Aborigines play long, low-sounding wind instruments called didgeridoos.



**Indigenous Peoples**
The compound Indigenous Peoples is **a blanket term that covers all First Nations, Inuit and Métis people in Canada in a relatively formal way**. It's parallel in construction to "Aboriginal Peoples," which appears in Canada's 1982 Constitution. The wording is relatively rare in news stories. The capitalized plural "Peoples" in this context refers to a lot of separate groups, each with distinct histories and cultures, and not merely to a large number of people.

**Métis** broadly refers to descendants of people of mixed First Nations and European ancestry who share a common culture. However, there are varying definitions of what it means to be Métis and who is or isn't Métis can be contentious. In most cases, Métis citizens will be a member of a recognized Métis organization and can trace their family lineage to recognized Métis families and geographic locations

**Inuit** refers to the Indigenous people in Canada's Arctic. **Avoid the term Eskimo to describe people in Canada**, although be aware that it remains the preferred term by some citizens of Alaska. **Do not confuse Inuit with Innu**, who are members of a First Nations people in Labrador and northeastern Quebec. (See [**Inuit and Inuk**](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk) for more detailed guidelines. including why **Inuit** alone **is preferred over "Inuit people."**)


**Avoid 'Indigenous Canadians,' 'Canada's Indigenous people'**


Steer clear of wording that stresses Indigenous people's relationship with Canada over their own culture and identity. In particular, **avoid the term "Indigenous Canadian(s)" unless attributed** (e.g., when transcribing clips or quoting from documents, like a court case or government-commissioned report), or it's an Indigenous person's stated preference. **Instead, generally use alternative forms that add "Canada" as a geographical detail**, such as:


> **Indigenous people in Canada**
>
> **Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada**


**Avoid possessive constructions like "Canada's Indigenous people" or implied possessive constructions like "the Indigenous people of Canada"** for the same reason. Again, a variation of "in Canada" is generally recommended (e.g., Indigenous communities in Canada). As the late writer and teacher Gregory Younging put it in the 2018 book Elements of Indigenous Style:


> _"Indigenous Peoples are independent sovereign nations that predate Euro-colonial states and are not 'owned' by Euro-colonial states. Indigenous style therefore avoids the use of possessives that imply this, such as 'Canada's Indigenous Peoples,' 'our Indigenous Peoples,' and 'the Indigenous Peoples of Canada.'"_

**First Nations, Indian**
The term **First Nations** conventionally applies to **all status and non-status Indians** in Canada. Be cautious when using the terms "status" and "non-status," however. They're potentially confusing and generally not relevant unless a story specifically deals with land claims, disagreements over funding for government services, etc.

Historically, status Indians were registered on an official list maintained by the federal government — qualifying for certain rights and payments not available to other Indigenous people in Canada, depending on the terms of applicable treaties. Under this system, non-status Indians and Métis were either never registered or were considered ineligible to register by federal officials. But disputes over interpretation of treaties and of "status" versus "non-status" classifications eventually led to various legal challenges.

In a landmark decision on April 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled that non-status Indians and Métis should be considered "Indians" under Section 91(24) of the 1867 Constitution Act — effectively expanding Ottawa's responsibilities for Indigenous people to approximately 200,000 Métis and 400,000 non-status Indians unaffiliated with specific reserves.



**Singular**
**First Nation** is often used as a synonym for "band" as defined by the Indian Act, even though the term is not officially recognized by law. (A band is a community of Indians with certain land and financial entitlements agreed to by the Crown.) The uppercase words First Nation now often appear in proper nouns in place of "band" or "reserve" (e.g., _the Sagkeeng First Nation_).

> A representative from the Indian Brook _First Nation_ agreed.
>
> Members of the Aamjiwnaang _First Nation_ raised health concerns a decade ago.
>
> A small _First Nation_ in northern B.C. is backing a controversial plan to save endangered woodland caribou.



**Plural**
**First Nations** means (a) more than one band as well as (b) members of one or more bands. It's also commonly used as a modifier for certain singular and plural nouns (e.g., a _First Nations leader_, a _First Nations community_, _five First Nations delegates_, _several First Nations languages_).

> She's from a _First Nations_ band in Alberta.
>
> He was elected head of the Assembly of _First Nations_ in 1997.
>
> The mystery began on a _First Nations_ reserve near Prince Albert, Sask.


**Adding 'the'**
**Generally include a definite article ("the") before the proper noun:**

> They found the artifact on the _Sioux Valley Dakota First Nation_, west of Brandon.
>
> _The Liard First Nation_ wants Yukon's Supreme Court to order a new hearing.


**Unless in a headline where space is scarce or in a construction that doesn't require it**:

> Audit slams _Roseau River First Nation_  (Headline; no 'the' needed)
> Manitoba pledges aid for _Peguis First Nation_  (Headline; no 'the' needed)

**Limit use of 'Indian'**
**Generally prefer the words Indigenous or First Nations unless "Indian" is part of a proper noun or provides extra information that is key to the story** (e.g., status versus non-status). This better reflects modern usage and also helps avoid confusion with people from the Indian subcontinent:

> _Indigenous_ leaders plan to push for faster land claim settlements.
>
> He's in favour of expanding _Indigenous_ self-government.
>
> The Union of Nova Scotia _Indians_ was given a copy of the Whycocomagh _First Nation's_ plan.
>
> Newfoundland's 4,000 Mi'kmaq see the New Brunswick decision as a precedent to extend their rights _as status Indians._


It's worth noting that the word Indian is also being used less by the federal government. For example, while the "legal" name of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development technically remains on the books, what's known as the ministry's "applied title" was officially changed to the **Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs** in late 2015. (See the [Ministry](/home/m/ministry) overview for details and related guidelines.)

**Avoid the term East Indian.** See [South Asian, Indian, Indo-Canadian](/home/s/south-asian-indian-indo-canadian) for related guidelines.

See also [**racial terms**](/home/r/racial-terms) for **general reporting guidelines on race and ethnicity**, including how to handle words like "racism" and "racist." The entry includes specific caveats about **BIPOC**, why a non-Indigenous term such as "person of colour" should never be confused with Indigeneity, and why "**racialized**" is our default umbrella expression in many contexts.

Note: A special website launched by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2007 was initially called "CBC Aboriginal." It was renamed [**CBC Indigenous**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Findigenous&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw07rj_7CDNYfXmJpG-d7bA9) in 2016. The site includes a wealth of news stories, background articles, timelines, FAQs, etc.

**I****nflammable, flammable and non-flammable**

The prefix **in** can get you in trouble.

**Incombustible** means _not combustible_.

**Indestructible** means _not destructible_.

But **inflammable** means _highly flammable_.


**To avoid confusion**
**Use the terms flammable** (it burns) **and non-flammable** (it doesn't).

Another option is plain English, such as “won’t burn.”

A fire retardant, by the way, may not prevent flames. If it simply slows the spread of fire we should say so.

### internet terms

**Internet terms**

**internet, the net** (no longer uppercase, except in proprietary names — for instance, the web browser Internet Explorer, which can be shortened to Explorer in news stories).

Just as we write about television programs (not "Television programs") and radio newscasts (not "Radio newscasts"), we now refer to internet stories and internet journalists, not to "Internet stories" or "Internet journalists."

CBC News dropped the capital "I" in the fall of 2003. Many other media organizations, including the BBC, have done so as well, although some newspapers and wire services continued to capitalize the word a decade later.

**WWW** and **World Wide Web**. Keep this noun uppercase because it's a recognized name given to a specific network on the internet. Continue to write "World Wide Web" (three words) even though the lowercase compound worldwide is normally fused.

**Use a small "w" when shortening** WWW **to "the web"** (in the same way the International Space Station becomes "the space station" in second reference.)


**w not W**
The following terms are lowercase: **web address, web browser, [webcam](/home/c#camera), webcast, web-enabled, web forum, weblog, webmaster, web page, web server, website.**

Also lowercase, **app, blog, chat room, [the cloud](/home/c#cloud)**, **cyberspace, domain name, dot-com, electronic mail, email, home page, hyperlink, instant messaging, server, shareware, site.
**
Some terms are normally lowercase unless part of a name: e.g., **online**, _but_ the **Canadian Atlas Online** (akin to radio versus CBC Radio).

Other terms are uppercase and may or may not be fused: e.g., **BlackBerry** (one word) **Palm Pilot** (two words). Check the spelling of any computer software or tools that you refer to in stories (e.g., **Adobe Acrobat, JavaScript, Microsoft Word** and **PowerPoint**). See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) (**eBay, iMac, iPad app**, etc.)

Keep well-known abbreviations uppercase (**CD-ROM, FTP, HTML, PDF, RAM, URL**) unless they're part of an internet address (e.g., FTP but "ftp:// typeanurlhere.com"). See [URLs](/home/u/urls) for more details about the structure of addresses.
**Spell out more obscure abbreviations** (e.g., **voice-over-internet protocol**, which is fine as **VoIP** in second reference). Sometimes it's simply better to pick another term (e.g., "web address" rather than URL) to make sure our readers understand.

**And do not use unfamiliar terms unless you explain what they mean.** Keep in mind that the need for such descriptions diminishes over time only if words become widely known.

For instance, at one point we had to tell our readers that a "blog" is a type of online journal that includes commentary and links. But within a few years a definition was no longer necessary. Jargon such as "phreaking" (using computer technology to make free phone calls), however, still requires a clear explanation.

**When a group, business, corporate division, etc., uses a variation of its internet address as a proper noun, capitalize the first word** (or in the case of well-known abbreviations, all relevant letters): Amazon.com, CBC.ca, CTV.ca, etc. **But do not impose web domains on nouns that don't require them**: use CTVglobemedia not CTVglobemedia.com for the corporate entity.

See also [intranet](/home/i/intranet)
See also [CBC](/home/c/cbc) (In news stories, use CBC.ca not cbc.ca, etc.)

For a detailed look at CBC.ca's switch to internet and web, see the Words: Woe & Wonder column, "[i for an I and other capital punishment](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Finternet_i.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0f1hPq1UK33wYvMaaDnnRq)"

### interpreter\_translator

**Interpreter versus translator**

These **–er and –or endings** are the source of errors. **Guard against common misspellings**.

Conventionally, **an interpreter translates the spoken word almost instantaneously** (usually within seconds) while **a translator tackles written text** under far less urgent time constraints. Interpreters may either speak (oral interpretation) or use gestures (sign language interpretation, also known as signing).

**It's not automatically wrong to use the terms "interpreter" and "translator" interchangeably in some contexts** — especially in an era of hand-held gadgets that provide fast, although very rough, translations from one language to another. **But careful writers generally stick with standard English and preserve the traditional meanings of interpreter** (someone working on the fly) **and translator** (someone working under less pressure, who has more time for nuanced crafting based on careful thought). **The latter conditions can producer clearer, more faithful wording. And this detail can sometimes be relevant in our journalism** (e.g., in stories involving disputes over the meaning of specific statements made in one language or another).

**Translations can involve interpretation**
Each role has its challenges. **A UN interpreter**, for example, must quickly convey a person's words in another language as faithfully as possible. **A scholarly translator**, by contrast, may have months or years to produce a document, but the volume of words will be greater, the scrutiny potentially more intense, and the expectations of critics probably much higher.

Technically, the root word "interpret" simply means "to explain the meaning of" (as in an art museum interpreter), and the root word "translate" simply means "to transfer" or "to move." So a translator might well "interpret" the meaning of various written material very subjectively. This means the final, say, Japanese translation of an English novel might well include specific interpretations of certain poetic passages in the original book.

**'Simultaneous interpretation'**
Since 1959, the Parliament of Canada has offered what it calls "**simultaneous interpretation**" of speeches and debates in the House of Commons. The women and men who actually sit in little booths and instantly give us the French or English versions of the proceedings are members of the **Parliamentary Interpretation Service**. It's worth noting that this unit is actually part of the federal government's larger **Translation Bureau**. Therefore, it would certainly not be wrong for us to refer to, say, a dispute over the "English translation" of the PM's remarks in the Commons — even though that English version was technically supplied by an "interpreter" working for the Department of Public Works.


### intranet

**Intranet**

The prefix **intra** is **Latin** for "**on the inside**" or "within," as in _intravenous_.
**
An intranet is a private or internal network.** Many corporations have them, including the CBC.

The prefix **inter** is **Latin** for **"between" or "among,"** as in _intercontinental_.

**The internet is a public system**. It connects a large number of computer networks around the globe.

See also [internet terms](/home/i/internet-terms) for web page (two words), website (one word), etc.

### Inuit and Inuk

**Inuit and Inuk**

**The Indigenous people in Canada's [Arctic](/home/a/arctic) are called Inuit.** It's an [Inuktut](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/inuktut/ "Inuktut") word that **means "people."** The proper noun Inuit was officially adopted in this country by various government organizations in the 1970s, replacing the term "Eskimo." **When referring to Inuit in other countries, be specific** (e.g., Greenland's Inuit, also known as "Greenlandic Inuit").

**Tens of thousands of Inuit** live in small communities from Alaska to Labrador. **They are one of three diverse groups that make up the Indigenous Peoples of Canada** (the other two being First Nations and Métis).


**Inuit are not 'Eskimos'**
**Do not use "Eskimo" to refer to any Inuit in Canada**. Many consider this once common name offensive. It's believed to come either from an Algonquian word for "eaters of raw meat," or from a different Indigenous term for "people who wear snowshoes." Either way, it's viewed as inapt by critics because it's a name that outsiders gave to those in the Far North. **Eskimo is still preferred by some residents of Alaska. It's also used to refer to certain Indigenous people in Siberia**, although they're more commonly called the "Yupiks."

**The word Eskimo is fine in a few conventional contexts, including attributed historical citations**, such as excerpts from books, **and references to some proper nouns**, such as a popular dog breed, a geographical name (e.g., Eskimo Hill Road in Virginia) or an official event (e.g., **the World Eskimo Indian Olympics** in Alaska).


**Edmonton Eskimos** falls into this category but **requires special care**. In July 2020, [the CFL team announced plans to change its name](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fedmonton%2Fedmonton-cfl-team-name-1.5657661&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NN3Ae_mwDfyk7NwOKQEVA) after mounting criticism that it was a racist relic of colonial power. A [2018 editorial in the Nunatsiaq News](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnunatsiaq.com%2Fstories%2Farticle%2Fpatience-in-time-the-edmonton-eskimos-name-will-change%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1orBmkY4HtFhGZPS-Yf8fX) summarizes the issue — including why the franchise's name was deemed inappropriate by many regardless of whether some Inuit considered the word Eskimo, itself, fine in various other contexts. [In June 2021, the team's new name was announced](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fedmonton%2Fedmonton-ee-cfl-football-name-1.6048578&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1zaX27i1frVA2AJUrBDFFI): the **Edmonton Elks**. It's **OK to use the proper noun Eskimos once when actually reporting on the controversy over the name** to ensure clarity. **But avoid repeating the words Eskimo/Eskimos in a story**, and **avoid using the name in headlines**. Furthermore, **there's no need to use the old name in routine reporting about the Elks**. See [controversial sports team names](/home/c/controversial-team-names) for general, related guidelines.


**Any member of 'the Inuit' is 'an Inuk'**
Generally **avoid the expression "Inuit people," which is considered redundant.** Instead prefer "Inuit" or "the Inuit" alone. Although "Inuit people" is relatively entrenched in English, it's unnecessarily wordy. This means that dropping "people" not only acknowledges the original Inuktut etymology, it helps keep our scripts tighter. At the same time, **it's OK to use the definite article "the" (i.e., "the Inuit")**, even though this differs from Inuktut usage, since orthodox English syntax and conventions apply.

**The Inuit are represented by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami** (which means "Inuit are united in Canada"). This national organization was originally called "Inuit Tapirisat" when it was founded in 1971. The group changed its name in 2001.
**
An Inuk is any member of the Inuit.** Calling someone an Inuk is a general description, while referring to them as, say, an Inuvialuk is much more specific. (An Inuvialuk is a member of the Inuvialuit, the Western Arctic Inuit. But since most of our readers won't know that, a clear explanation is required.)

**Do not confuse Inuit with Innu** (who are members of a First Nations people in Labrador and northeastern Quebec).


**Plural versus singular**
**Inuit is the correct plural** (noun or modifier). **Inuk is correct for most singular constructions** (noun or modifier). Both are always uppercase:

_Inuit scholars point out that all languages evolve, including Inuktut.

She married an Inuk artist and moved to Pangnirtung, Nunavut, in 1988.

The nurses are Inuit. The doctor is an Inuk._ (But never "the doctor is Inuit.")

**The exceptions are when Inuit is used as an adjective before collective nouns** (such as delegation, family, government, etc.), **and when Inuit serves as an adjective that implies a possessive** (e.g., the "Inuit housing shortage" which means "housing shortage of the Inuit").
**
Never add an "s" or an apostrophe and an "s" to either Inuit or Inuk.** It's not grammatically valid to impose an English possessive construction on these Inuktut words, according to the Guide to Canadian English Usage and other language authorities. Instead, recast the sentence (e.g., the Inuit language or the language of the Inuit but never "the Inuit's language").


**Examples**

the Inuit
Inuit children
an Inuk boy
an Inuit delegation (_which means a delegation of Inuit_)
an Inuk delegate (_which means a delegate who is Inuk_)
the Inuit family (_which means all Inuit members of a family_)
Inuit art
Inuit traditions
Inuit policy (_which means policy of the Inuit_)
an Inuk teacher (_which means a teacher who is an Inuk_)

Following the above guidelines, **the Inuk leader** would refer to a leader who is Inuk while **the Inuit leader** would refer to a leader of the people known as Inuit.

### Inuit and Inuk

**Inuktut**

**Inuktut** is not a new term, as [this article published by CBC North in 2019](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuktut-prompts-correction-requests-1.5153188) details.

Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national group representing Inuit in Canada, [defines Inuktut](https://www.itk.ca/projects/inuktut/) as “the language of Inuit, spoken across Inuit Nunaat, which includes Greenland, Alaska and Inuit Nunangat in Northern Canada.”

[Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit](https://www.taiguusiliuqtiit.ca/sites/default/files/public/files/annual_reports/iut_annual_report_2015_-2016-final.pdf), the Inuit language authority created by the Government of Nunavut, says: “The term 'Inuktut' will enable the Government \[of Nunavut\] to refer to all of the dialects spoken in Nunavut as a single unified language. It will replace ‘the Inuit Language’ and ‘Inuktitut/Inuinnaqtun’ in government communications to describe the language in all of its richness and diversity.”

Note that Inuktut encompasses all Inuit language dialects — including Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and Inuvialuktun — that are used in different regions. It is important to differentiate for audiences whether we are referring to a specific dialect (for example, Inuktitut) or all of the dialects together.

As the term Inuktut becomes more common, it could be helpful to consider whether a brief explanation would be useful for audiences when using it in a story.

### Ireland

**Irish Republic versus Northern Ireland**

**Irish Republic, the Republic of Ireland
****The Republic of Ireland, which can also be called the Irish Republic, officially became a sovereign European country in 1948**, breaking the last ties to the British Commonwealth. It joined the United Nations in 1955.

The **capital city is Dublin.**

Ireland had initially gained “dominion status” (akin to early years in Canada) in 1921, and became known as the Irish Free State. In 1937, the region adopted a new constitution after holding a plebiscite, and declared itself independent.

**Do not call it Eire** (the Irish name used before the English proper noun, the Republic of Ireland, was adopted).

**Do not call it Southern Ireland.

Use Ireland alone only in second reference, and only if the story is exclusively about the Irish Republic** (i.e., that there will be no confusion with the separate region known as Northern Ireland).


**Northern Ireland**
**Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.

**The **capital city is Belfast.

Avoid referring to Northern Ireland as Britain** (which has a narrower meaning), **or as a British region.

Do not call it Ireland. Do not call it a country. Refer to it generally as a region or area.**

**Avoid describing Northern Ireland as a province unless that term is attributed**, since the noun is seen by some as belittling, given the region's history as well as its own legislative powers. The label also has misleading echoes of the island's ancient provinces, such as Ulster and Munster. Be aware that **the official name is simply Northern Ireland**, and that the word "province" does not appear anywhere in Westminster's Northern Ireland Act of 1998. It forms the northeastern tip of a large island west of the Irish Sea. The rest of the land mass is a separate country known as the Republic of Ireland (see [Irish Republic above](#Irish-Republic)).

**Northern Ireland has been either a self-governing or a London-ruled region since the U.K.'s Government of Ireland Act was passed in 1920.** During the Irish War of Independence, the British government partitioned the island in 1921, in response to concerns by unionists in the north. The newly created Parliament of Northern Ireland declined to join the Irish Free State to the south, which was formally established in Dublin in 1922.

Originally made up of a majority of British loyalists (called unionists), Northern Ireland has since become more evenly split because of demographic changes. The **unionists, mainly Protestant,** and the **nationalists, mainly Irish Catholic**, have been fighting over the political future control of the place for more than half a century. **Political violence in the region largely ended after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998**, which expanded regional legislative powers in a new assembly in Belfast, and enshrined shared decision-making between nationalists (who favour joining the Republic of Ireland), and unionists (who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K.). The Good Friday Agreement is **also known as the Belfast Agreement.**

When reporting on Northern Ireland, **use the terms unionists and nationalists. Avoid the label loyalists**, which can suggest that the nationalists are not loyal to their own cause for independence.

**Do not use the name Ulster as a synonym for Northern Ireland, even informally**, since only six of the original nine counties that historically formed the province of Ulster are in Northern Ireland. (The other three counties are now in the Republic of Ireland.) **Ulster is fine when attributed**, either in directly transcribed quotes or in proper nouns (e.g., **Ulster Unionist Party**).

### ironic

**Ironic, ironically**

**Ironic** has **three primary meanings**, and not one of them is in high demand in news stories.



1.  **When someone intentionally uses language to convey the opposite meaning of the words chosen** (e.g., people say _“that’s a big surprise”_ in order to underscore just how unsurprising a development is)**.**
2.  **When an ending is the opposite of what was expected.**
3.  **When in a movie, play, etc., the audience knows some things that certain characters do not.**

**The terms irony and ironically are _frequently misused_. If something is strange, coincidental, paradoxical, etc., we should simply call it that.**

### Islam

**Islam**

**Islam** (n.) One of the world's largest religions. Does not need to be defined in stories.


She says **Islam** has a similar tradition.



**Islamophobia** (n.) A fear of or hostility toward Muslims or their religion. Does not need to be defined in stories.


The study calls the recent rise in **Islamophobia** alarming.


**Islamic** (adj.) Of, about or related to Islam. Does not need to be defined in stories.


They came from an **Islamic** country.


**Islamicist** (n.) A scholar or expert on Islamic culture, history, religion, etc. Generally avoid in stories. While the generic adjective Islamic is well known, the word Islamicist is not. It's also easily confused with Islamist, which has a completely different meaning.


The professor is an atheist as well as an Islamicist. (_POOR. Term is obscure and potentially misleading_)

The professor is an atheist as well as an **expert on Islam**. (_PREFERRED_)


**Islamist** (n.) Although this word has become increasingly common in news reporting, it can still cause confusion and misunderstanding unless a story's context makes the meaning clear. The **most neutral definition of _Islamist_: A follower of a political and cultural movement known as Islamism**, who believes that the Qur'an should rule all aspects of life (religious, political and personal). **A common implication** is: **A Muslim radical or extremist** who not only believes that Western values are eroding Islam but who is prepared to use violence to create Islamic states that promote fundamental doctrines and enforce strict Shariah law (the legal code of Islam). **In other words, Islamists are Islamic fundamentalists who may or may not be militant.**

**Islamist as an attributive noun**
When referring to entire countries, there's usually no confusion.

They want an **Islamist** state.


But when reporting on specific groups or individuals, more direct language is often preferred.


**Islamist militants** have threatened to carry out more attacks.
He's a member of a **militant Islamist group**.
The pamphlets were printed by **non-violent Islamists**.
They describe it as a **non-militant Islamist party**.


If the facts back the story, for instance, terms such as **Islamist militants** and **militant Islamist groups** can help clarify that the Islamists you're referring to endorse the use of violence. Other options include **Islamic radicals** or **Muslim extremists**. On the other hand, if you're talking about people who are simply highly political and campaigning without force for the creation of an Islamic state, terms like **non-violent Islamists** or members of **non-militant Islamist parties** help our audience understand this important detail.

**Other commonly encountered language**
Followers of Islam are **Muslim**. Their holy book is the **Qur'an**. They say it was revealed by **Allah** (God) to the **Prophet Muhammad** in the seventh century. The term **Shariah law** refers to the legal code of Islam and is based on the Qur'an. Traditional Shariah law deals with both civil and criminal justice, covering everything from banking and business contracts to diet, hygiene, dress, marriage, abortion and homosexuality.

Islam has two main branches or divisions: **Sunni** (representing about 85 per cent of Muslims) and **Shia** (the second-largest sect). Most Shias live in Iran and Iraq, where they are in the majority, as well as in Pakistan and India where they remain in the minority.


CBC News preference: Shia (for n. and adj.); Shias (plural); Shias' (plural possessive). Avoid _Shiite_ except in directly transcribed quotes.


**Some of the many clerical titles**
**Ayatollah** (used by Shias, especially in Iran) to refer to senior clergy.


Ayatollah Ali Khamenei decided …
Several grand ayatollahs openly disagreed with him.


**Mullah** (lower-level clergy)


Mullah Mohammad Omar said …
The mullah spoke first.


**Imam** (a common title for a prayer leader at a mosque)


Imam Hamid Slimi pointed out …
He talked to the imam.

### Islamic community centre

**Islamic community centre near WTC site**

**Avoid the term "Ground Zero mosque" or "mosque at Ground Zero."** It's a proposed Islamic community centre in a busy commercial area NEAR Ground Zero (two blocks from the edge of the sprawling old World Trade Center site, and about six standard Manhattan blocks from where the WTC's North Tower stood).

Prefer the terms **Islamic community centre** or **Islamic centre**.

**Since the plans do include a prayer space considered a mosque**, and since that's central to the controversy over construction, **it's OK to use the noun mosque in headlines, where space is at a premium**. Examples of acceptable language in headlines:

> _mosque near WTC site_
>
> _mosque near Ground Zero_


**But always provide essential context high in stories. Do not give the impression that the entire building will be a mosque.** For instance:

> _The proposed Islamic community centre near Ground Zero includes a mosque._
>
> _The group backs construction of the Islamic centre and mosque._

**Optional background**
When space allows in features, etc., it may be beneficial to point out the proposed facility would also have a gym, swimming pool and 500-seat auditorium. Some other facts worth noting as we cover this story: Muslim prayer services have been held at the same location since 2009, inside what used to be a clothing store, and there is already a mosque about five blocks from the old WTC site.

**The idiomatic term "Ground Zero" is a common and acceptable way to describe the site of the Sept. 11, 2001**, attacks in New York City. But **calling it the old World Trade Center (WTC) site is sometimes preferable** because it's fact-based. Use your judgment.

### it's versus its

**It’s versus its**

The rule is straightforward:

**Use it’s as a contraction** (_it is_ or _it has_):

_“It’s a lovely day”_ and _“It’s got potential.”_

The form is similar to she’s (_she is_ or _she has_) and he’s (_he is_ or _he has_).

**Use its** (no apostrophe) to **indicate possession:**

_“The commission released its report earlier than expected.”_

Other possessive pronouns _without_ apostrophes include: his, hers, ours, theirs

Judaism's three major movements are Orthodox, Conservative and Reform. Bear in mind that the worldwide Jewish community is diverse. Not all support the Zionist movement (the creation and protection of the state of Israel), and not all agree with the Jewish state's policies.

**jury, grand jury** 

**justice** **Chief Justice George Burns**, chief justice in second reference; **Justice Gracie Allen** (not Madam Justice), Allen or the judge or justice in second reference; justice of the peace, **justice of the peace Lou Costello**. The word "justice" is normally reserved for members of higher courts, conventionally defined as those handling various types of appeals — including a province's or territory's highest court (e.g., the Alberta Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador) as well as the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada (e.g., **Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin**, the chief justice or McLachlin in second reference). "Justice" is also OK for members of so-called "superior" courts (e.g., the Alberta Court of King's Bench, the Ontario Superior Court, the Supreme Court of B.C.), as in **Quebec Superior Court Justice France Charbonneau**, Charbonneau or the judge or the justice in second reference. In addition to hearing their own trials, these women and men act as the first level of appeal for certain judgments from provincial and territorial courts. The word "judge" is generally used for lower courts, including provincial and territorial courts, as well as youth and family division courts. Keep in mind that the initial J. before a judge's surname in court documents stands for "justice" rather than a given name, while J. A. means "justice of appeal" and C. J. means "chief justice." The initials J.P. on legal documents commonly refers to "justice of the peace." (See [judge](/home/j#judge) above, as well as [titles](/home/t/titles) and [courts](/home/c/courts))

**just deserts** (_not_ desserts) The term "getting their just deserts" has nothing to do with pastries, ice cream or other desserts. It's based on the French word for "deserve," which helps explain the single "s." Speaking of "deserve," our audience is entitled to something beyond clichés, no matter how they're spelled.

### jail versus prison

**Jail versus prison**

**Jail**
In Canada, **a jail is normally a provincially run institution** where people are held temporarily, or where they serve **sentences of less than two years**.

**Keep the generic word “jail” lowercase unless it’s part of a proper name**, _which is relatively rare_:

… the Central North Correction Centre in Penetanguishene, Ont.
… **the Penetanguishene jail**
… the **Don Jail** in Toronto
… **the Sleepy Hollow provincial jail**
… the old **York County Jail**
… **Passaic County Jail**, _but_ **the county jail**


**Prison**
In Canada, **a prison is a federally run institution** where people serve **terms of two years or more**. There are different categories: **medium-security, maximum-security**, etc.

Do _not_ use the term “prison” when referring to holding cells at a detention centre or to describe provincial jails.

**Keep the generic word “prison” lowercase unless it’s part of a proper name:**

… the **Millhaven Institution** or **Millhaven prison** but _not_ the Millhaven Prison
… the **Prison for Women** in Kingston, Ont.
… the **Kingston Penitentiary**
… the **Saskatchewan Penitentiary** (in Prince Alberta, Sask.)
… the **Prince Albert prison** but _not_ the Prince Albert Prison
… the **prison in Prince Albert, Sask.**

Be sure to use the word “**Institution**” _not_ “Institute” when writing out a name in full (**Springhill Institution** or the **Springhill prison**).

**In second reference, the proper name can be shortened** (the _riot at Springhill_) or lowercase generic terms can be used (the _prison_, the _penitentiary_). Do not call prisons jails. (See jail above)

The Correctional Service of Canada (also known as Corrections Canada) lists [all prisons across the country](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csc-scc.gc.ca%2Finstitutions%2F001002-0001-eng.shtml&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1FA1OLduXWgX4RMmPR2HqG) on its website.

### jihad

**Jihad**

This was originally an Arabic term for "to strive." In the broadest sense, it means **a struggle to improve oneself or to do good.**

But **it also refers to a holy war carried out by certain Muslims against enemies of their faith.**

Some Islamic scholars say the term is often misused, since they argue that a true holy war must be in self-defence. But the word is found in the names of several well-known organizations, including the **Islamic Jihad** (a militant group that vows to destroy Israel and set up an Islamic Palestinian state).

**The words jihad and jihadist have become well enough known that they no longer require explanation in many cases**, depending on context.

When definitions are deemed necessary, **we can generally describe jihad as a "holy war" against enemies of Islam** based on entrenched usage**. Attribution is preferable when people are pressing for a specific uprising** (e.g., _"Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein called for a jihad, or holy war, against the United States and other countries that helped topple his regime."_)


> CBCNews.ca style: Do **not** put jihad in [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

### joual

**Joual**

Be careful when using this term, which first appeared in print in a newspaper editorial in Quebec in the late 1950s.

The Canadian Oxford defines joual as: “**A variety of Canadian French considered to be uneducated, characterized by non-standard grammar and syntax and, especially in cities, numerous English borrowings.**”

_It should not be used to refer to Quebec French in general_. It implies that a person is making mistakes when they speak, either because they’re poorly educated or lazy.

The word’s etymology alone conveys its pejorative nature. It’s supposed to represent the mispronunciation of the French word for horse, _cheval_.

### jumbo jet

**jumbo jet**

This is **a generic term for any wide-bodied jet plane**. **It does _not_ need to be capitalized.**

Examples are: the **Boeing 747, Lockheed L-1011** and **DC-10**

For more background on why "jumbo" is not "Jumbo," see the Words: Woe & Wonder column [Jumbo Jets and other Jargon](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fjumbo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2a9FlPFQnNoWSvI_j4lnCK).

****kaboom****

**Kabul** (not "Kabol," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames)) OK in headlines. Does not need "Afghanistan" placed after it in first reference, as long as the geographical location is clear from the story's context. As with Kandahar, this normally means the country must be mentioned within the first few paragraphs.

**Kahnawà:ke** (First Nation near Montreal), the **Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke**, the **Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke**, etc. Our style is to match the spellings used by Indigenous communities, including accents.

**Kandahar Airfield** (a NATO-run airfield) _Avoid_ the noun "Kandahar International Airport" in stories about the military airfield because it's confusing to readers. See [airport names](/home/a/airport) for relevant capitalization guidelines (i.e., "Airfield" versus "airfield").

**Kashmir** (disputed region between India and Pakistan) This mountainous territory has been fought over since the late 1940s. Use neutral language, such as "run" or "controlled" or "administered," when distinguishing between regions (e.g., India-controlled Kashmir, India-run Kashmir, Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan-administered Kashmir). The [Line of Control](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-05-05-line-of-control/ "2025 05 05 - Line of Control") divides the disputed regions.

**keyboard, keyhole, keynote** (as in **keynote speaker**), **keypad, keypunch, keystroke, keyword**

**key (as a separate modifier)**
**key card** (_see below_), **key chain, key ring**

**key card** (n.), as in a hotel room key card; **key-card** (adj.), as in, key-card access, key-card technology. The terms **key card** and **card key** are synonymous in Canada. Either can be used. But stick to one form within any given story.

****Keystone Kops****

**KGB** (Old Russian abbreviation for "Committee of State Security.") The term is OK in news stories, but include a brief definition such as "the former Soviet secret police." See also [Kremlin](/home/k/kremlin) and U.S.S.R.

**Khadr, Abdurahman** (Canadian citizen taken into custody by the U.S. in Afghanistan. He was released from the American military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in 2003.) His father, **Ahmed Said Khadr**, was killed during a raid by Pakistani forces in October 2003. Abdurahman has three brothers: **Abdullah Khadr**, **Omar Khadr** and Abdul Karim Khadr. (See the CBCNews.ca [timeline](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Fbackground%2Fkhadr%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0RXjF-2EH4USzNsuMb5yUN))

Khadafy (_use_ **Gadhafi, Moammar**)

**khaki**

**Khalistan movement** (a militant-backed campaign to establish a Sikh homeland in South Asia) Started around 1940, the secessionist movement has sought to create an independent country called Khalistan in the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab, which straddles northern India and Pakistan. **Khalistani extremists** have been linked to deadly attacks over the decades, including the 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 329 people. Briefly explain/define terms like "Khalistani extremists" in stories (e.g., "militant Sikh separatists"). The movement's various factions include groups listed as terrorist organizations by Canada and other countries (e.g., the **International Sikh Youth Federation**, known as ISYF, and **Babbar Khalsa International**, known as BKI). **Avoid implying that all Sikh separatists support violence** or are members of the violent Khalistan movement. (See [separatist](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist#separatist))

**KHL** (Russia's **Kontinental Hockey League**) Use the Cyrillic K to avoid confusion with Canada's CHL.

[**kibitz**](/home/k/kibitz) (v.), **kibitzer** (n.) Originally pejorative but now also means "to joke or chat"

**kick back** (v.), **kickback** (n.), **kick off** (v.), **kickoff** (n.)

**kick-start, kick-starter** (hyphenated), but **Kickstarter** (for crowdfunding website)

**kidnap, kidnapped, kidnapper** (Kidnappings are generally thought of a specific types of [abductions](/home/a#abduction) involving ransom or other demands)

**Kiev** (Use Kyiv for the city, but chicken Kiev for the recipe) See [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names)

**killer whales** (OK in first reference to **orcas** if preferred) The terms orca and killer whale can be used interchangeably because the latter is deeply entrenched. But generally avoid shortening "killer whales" to "whales" alone in second reference because the noun is too vague. (Experts consider the animals part of the dolphin family. And while all dolphins are technically a type of whale, most of our audience won't know that.) Avoid the needless compound "orca whales," which is redundant at best. It's normally unnecessary to use the scientific name _Orcinus orca_. When reporting names of specific orcas, follow the tradition of fusing the pod group's letter with a given animal's number (e.g., **J50, K44, L90**). The word pod is lowercase (e.g., the **J pod**, the **K pod**, the **L pod**). See [alphanumeric designations](/home/n/numbers#alphanumeric) for related guidelines

**kilo** (_avoid_ using as an abbreviation for kilogram or kilometre) See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)

**kilobyte (KB)** No period in short form, which is singular and plural, as in **1 KB, 10 KB, 256 KB**, etc. Since the term has become common, no definition is required in first reference. Note: Technically, there are 1,024 bytes in 1 KB. But in general news stories, it's OK to consider 1 KB as roughly 1,000 bytes. (See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout) for more guidelines on symbols that look like abbreviations)

**kilogram (kg)** No period in short form, which is singular and plural. We generally spell out kilogram and kilograms, although "kg" is fine in graphics, headlines, etc. (See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout))

**kilometre, kilometres (km), kilometres per hour (km/h)** There are no periods in metric abbreviations, and no "s" in plural forms. As outlined in our detailed [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) guidelines, we generally spell out kilometre and kilometres, but the term km/h is fine in first and subsequent references.
 (See also [pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D31685&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2oXAGFEu3itdTRV_AwXs4L))

**Kim Jong-un** (Kim in second reference) Became North Korea's leader in December 2011, after the death of his father **Kim Jong-il**.
Kim Jong-un's sister is **Kim Kyong-hui**. His grandfather, **Kim Il-sung** (with a capital I in "Il-sung," based on convention), founded North Korea in 1948. (See also [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) and [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations))

**King, the** (of the U.K. and Canada); former British monarchs retain a capital "K," as in **King George VI** and **the former King**; use **king** lowercase when referring to the monarchs of other countries, as in **former king Farouk**, unless the title appears before the name of the reigning king (e.g., **King Juan Carlos** of Spain but **the king** of Spain). See also [royal titles](/home/r/royal-titles) for related guidelines, including flexibility around **King Charles III** versus **King Charles**.

**Kingstown, Ireland** (not "Dun Laoghaire," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Kinsmen Clubs** (_not_ Kinsmen's)

**kippa** (generally use **skullcap** outside of direct quotes) There are several spellings of the English [transliteration](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transliterations/ "Transliterations") from Hebrew, including kippah and koppel. For consistency, stick with kippa, if the word is used at all. See also the Yiddish term [yarmulke](/home/y#yarmulke)

**Kiss** (not KISS) A rock group (See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

**Kishida, Fumio** (became PM of Japan in the fall of 2021) We report his name as **Fumio Kishida** (with **Kishida** in second reference), based on entrenched usage. Be aware that the government of Japan has taken a different approach to its citizens' names since 2019, which can lead to confusion in various official documents, news releases, etc. (See [Japanese names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/asian-names/#Japanese-names "Asian names") for details)

**Kobani** (city in northern Syria, near border with Turkey) Use this [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) over other spellings, including "Kobane"

**Koh-i-Noor** (one of the largest cut diamonds in the world) Part of the British Crown Jewels since the mid-1800s, the Koh-i-Noor is believed to have been unearthed in what is now India more than half a millennium ago, although the diamond's exact history is unknown. The name means "mountain of light" in Persian. There are several [transliterations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transliterations/ "Transliterations"), including fused versions. For consistency, use this spelling.

**Kolkata** (replaces the old name "Calcutta") Use the revised spelling in all contexts, including **Mother Teresa of Kolkata**. (See [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) for related guidelines). Since the city is so well known, Kolkata does not need to be followed by the country name, India.

**Korean War** (1950-53) For much of the first half of the 20th century, Japan occupied Korea. Then at the end of the Second World War, the peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel. The U.S. controlled the southern region while the Soviet Union controlled the northern territory. North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950. Canada's military joined UN-led forces to push back the assault. Peace negotiations started in 1951, but fighting continued for another two years. **While an armistice was agreed to in July 1953, no peace treaty was signed.** This means **it's inaccurate to claim that the "war ended" in 1953.** Instead, use language such as "fighting stopped" or an "armistice was reached."

****[Kosovo](/home/b/balkans#Kosovo)****

**kowtow** (_never_ cowtow) To follow without question, to be obsequious

**K-pop** (music genre) Stands for "Korean popular music." Spelling out is generally unnecessary as long as the story's context makes the meaning clear. Uppercase K because it's rooted in a proper noun (the Republic of Korea, commonly known as South Korea). Lowercase "p," as in pop music.

**Kurdistan** (avoid this noun on its own) There is no country known as Kurdistan. There is, however, an autonomous section of northern Iraq called **Iraqi Kurdistan**, run by a Kurdish regional government. The territory, commonly described as **the Kurdistan region of Iraq**, is specifically recognized in Iraq's constitution. Either name is OK in our journalism as long as we make it clear it's not a sovereign country. While sizable Kurdish populations living in Turkey, Syria and Iran are fighting for more autonomy, or for the creation of a separate state, it's inaccurate to refer to these places as "Kurdistan." Instead, always specify the country involved (e.g., "a Kurdish-controlled section of Syria") to ensure our audience understands a given story. (See [**Kurds**](/home/k#Kurds) below)

**Kurdistan Workers' Party** (see [**PKK**](/home/p#PKK))

**Kurds** (n.) An ethnic group of about 30 million people primarily living in a region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Their language, Kurdish, is related to Farsi and Pashto, and includes several distinct dialects. The cultural identity of Kurds has been under siege by various governments for generations — from language restrictions to traditional clothing bans. As of 2019, Kurds made up less than two per cent of the population of Armenia, approximately 10 per cent of Iran, 15 per cent of Iraq, just under 10 per cent of Syria and roughly 20 per cent of Turkey, where they are the largest minority group in the country. Political campaigns for Kurdish independence have rekindled in recent decades. Be precise when reporting on crackdowns against militant Kurdish separatists. For example, while it's accurate to say the government of Turkey considers groups like the **[PKK](/home/p#PKK)** to be terrorists, avoid stating or implying that it considers all Kurds to be terrorists.

### kibitz

**Kibitz**

kibitz (v.), kibitzer (n.)

**Kibitz was originally pejorative** (the Yiddish term came from a German word that meant busybody or lapwing).

It described **the act meddling or offering unsolicited advice** (e.g., during a card game).

**But it’s primary meaning today is to chat or joke lightheartedly**, according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

### Kremlin

**Kremlin**

Russia is a democracy. Its **parliament is called the Federal Assembly.** There are two bodies: the **State Duma** (the lower house), and the **Federation Council** (the upper house).

The term **_Kremlin_ refers to the president, ministers and staff** (akin to the word "administration" in the United States).

In news stories, **we can write that the Kremlin has outlined certain policies, or that it's opposed to a specific measure.**

**But careful writers avoid calling an actual vote in Russia's State Duma or Federation Council a "Kremlin move" or a "Kremlin decision."
**
In the former Soviet Union, the Politburo was the top policy-making secretariat of the country's Communist Party. It normally had about a dozen members and was headed by the party general secretary.

The old Politburo ran things, more or less. (In theory, its members were elected by the Central Committee, but in reality the powerful minority dominated the larger body.)

### kudo

**Kudos**

The word comes from the Greek term for “glory,” and is now used to offer praise, pay a compliment or acknowledge credit.

**Many language commentators argue that it should always be treated as a singular**, since **there is no such thing as one “kudo.” It’s an “uncountable noun” like pathos or prestige.**

Although singular verbs can look or sound wrong (“the kudos is long overdue” or “the kudos was deserved” or “kudos goes to the copy editor”), these forms are correct.

U.S. writer Bill Bryson says this problem helps expose the word as “a pompous pretender,” **especially when there are other equally good terms available (praise goes to, credit goes to, etc.)**.

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary notes that **the use of plural verbs with kudos is well established in North America. So if you’re transcribing a quote, don’t “fix” this construction.**

But if the sentence is yours, change it. Instead of writing “kudos go to,” for instance, either shorten the phrase (“kudos to …”) or simply pick another word.

**La Meute** (far-right group in Quebec; translated as "Wolf Pack" in English) It’s OK to refer to La Meute as far-right, but always add brief detail so our audience understands why we use this label. For instance: "The group says current immigration and multicultural policies threaten Quebec society, and its members frequently post Islamophobic comments online." La Meute officially condemns the use of violence, so avoid modifiers such as "extreme," which imply militancy.

The European Union has refused to recognize Lukashenko as leader since 2020. But other countries, including Canada, continue to call him president while simultaneously criticizing his government and its policies. CBC News practice is to strive to use meaningful language in our journalism that reflects reality on the ground. As of June 2023, Lukashenko was still in office, commanding the military and overseeing all national domestic affairs.

### LGBT

**Overview**
**Sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., should be referred to only when relevant.** In 2010, for example, the following headline appeared in the CBC News Network TV crawl: "2 gay men in Vancouver quit jobs after winning lottery." The text was strikingly inapt, which we immediately acknowledged in our response to an ombudsman complaint.

**Avoid dated and inaccurate expressions** such as "sexual preference" and "alternative lifestyle" **that wrongly imply sexual orientation boils down to choice.**

**2SLGBTQ+ is our default term** in general news stories (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ rights). **It does NOT need to be spelled out** as two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.

**Opt for precise language when the facts fit** (e.g., a homophobic slur versus a 2SLGBTQ+ slur, anti-trans versus anti-2SLGBTQ+). See [prefer specific over generic](#preferspecific) below for details.

**Consider the word queer** as a synonym in some contexts. (See ['](##queer "LGBTQ (1) --- Revised --- DRAFT")[Queer' requires caution](#queer)).

People are **transgender**, not "transgendered." **Being transgender has nothing to do with sexual orientation.** A transgender person could be gay, straight, bisexual, asexual, etc. (See [transgender](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/ "Transgender") for related guidelines, including use of pronouns.)

**EVOLVING TERMINOLOGY:** All English is organic, but some areas change faster than others, including words and phrases tied to the 2SLGBTQ+ community. We will continue to revise our style as required to reflect current, common usage. **This entry is based on recommendations by the CBC News language advisory group.** It was last updated in **February 2024**.

**2SLGBTQ+**

**Use 2SLGBTQ+ as the default umbrella term in most stories**, even in second reference (**2SLGBTQ+ rights**, and members of **the 2SLGBTQ+ community**). The abbreviation **does NOT need to be spelled out** as _two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer_. **Shorter variations are OK when attributed** (e.g., in directly transcribed clips and the names of groups or events). 

**Generally use 2SLGBTQ+, even in stories outside of Canada** (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ activists in Europe, China's 2SLGBTQ+ community). This approach simplifies our style, acknowledges two-spirit people within Indigenous communities around the globe, and frames stories in a way that is familiar to our Canadian audience.

**2SLGBTQ+ is suitable as a modifier in plural constructions** (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ athletes, 2SLGBTQ+ writers, 2SLGBTQ+ lawyers). **But generally avoid the abbreviation in singular references to individuals**. For instance, instead of writing "Jane is 2SLGBTQ+," report the specific detail that's relevant to a given story (e.g., Jane is a gay athlete, Jane is a bisexual politician, Jane is a trans lawyer).

It's now a convention to **include the + sign to underscore that the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ alone does not cover all members of the community.** While the Q, itself, is now usually assumed to be short for "queer" rather than for "questioning," not everyone views the Q as all-encompassing. 

**It's usually unnecessary to add characters after +**, outside of direct attribution. **It's also important to understand the downside of density.** While the instinct of well-intentioned journalists can be to keep tacking on letters to bolster inclusivity, such as A for asexual and I for intersex (2SLGBTQ2SIA+), **the price paid includes (i) alienating various groups** not represented in the expanded abbreviation, **and (ii) making broadcast scripts far less conversational** — not only harder to read on air but also more difficult for our audience to digest.

**Avoid implying that 2SLGBTQ+ includes "allies."** It may be relevant to mention supporters (allies) in stories. But the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+ becomes virtually meaningless if it's so broadly defined that only intolerant people are left out. At the end of the day, a cisgender, straight person may be a vocal advocate for gay and trans rights, but that doesn't make the individual part of the 2SLGBTQ+ community.

**Do not call 2SLGBTQ+ or any of its variations an "[acronym](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/acronyms/ "Acronyms"),"** which traditionally means a pronounceable term like NASA and UNICEF. The fact that the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+ is not an acronym is central to the challenge speakers face when letters or other characters are added.

**TIP:** To sound as natural as possible on air, **broadcast journalists unaccustomed to saying 2SLGBTQ+ should practice the abbreviation** until it becomes as second nature to say as any other eight-syllable sequence (e.g., "heterosexuality" and "individualization").

**Two-spirit (2S)**

The adjective **two-spirit (2S)**, coined in the early 1990s, is **a broad label used by some Indigenous people who describe themselves having both masculine and feminine spirits.** It has different meanings to different individuals, according to [researchers at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://lgbtqhealth.ca/community/two-spirit.php). **Two-spirit can refer to sexual orientation as well as to a wide range of gender identities**. Furthermore, the meaning is not static, as noted in this [2021 CBC Radio feature](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/how-two-spirit-people-are-coming-in-to-their-communities-1.6272654) by _Unreserved_.

**Two-spirit should not be applied to non-Indigenous people.** Given how familiar the term has become, **it no longer needs to be defined in most stories, as long as the context makes the meaning clear**. When spelled out, use two-spirit rather than "two-spirited" (e.g., a two-spirit person, and a collection of poems by two-spirit writers).


(For use of **Indigiqueer**, see ['Queer' requires caution](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#queer "2SLGBTQ+") below.)

**'Queer' requires caution**

**Queer has been embraced by many members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community as an umbrella term** to describe themselves. **But it remains offensive to others and, so, demands care.**

**Champions of the word queer believe that widespread usage will numb its derogatory sting**, in the same way that "gay" eventually morphed from an insult into a label of pride. They also point out that queer is much easier to say than 2SLGBTQ+ or its variants, which fills a needed gap until an actual acronym is coined that catches on (i.e., until a new, pronounceable abbreviation gains far-flung currency ). **Opponents say they continue to see and hear the term queer as a slight**, given its common meaning of "odd" or "strange" as well as its history as a pejorative used against the 2SLGBTQ+ community. **Informal surveys suggest there's a generational divide between these two camps, with an increasing number of young people embracing "queer" as a convenient, neutral description.**

**Queer is OK in CBC journalism when we're covering organizations or people who use the term themselves.** This can range from proper nouns (e.g., the 2019 graphic novel **Gender Queer**, the 2018 TV series **Queer Eye**, the 2017 documentary **Queer Nation**) to individuals talking about being genderqueer, or about being part of Canada's queer community. **But we should avoid using queer when specifically referring to any person or group known to object to the term.** EXAMPLES:

-   **Queer OK in profiles of people who refer to themselves this way.**

> > _As a queer director, she says she brings a different perspective to films._

-   **Queer OK in broadcast clips and directly transcribed quotes**, as long as meaning is not hateful.

> > _"Queer voters like us can spot homophobic politicians a mile away."_

-   **Queer OK as an unattributed umbrella term in certain generic contexts.**

> > _It's the city's only queer nightclub._
> > _It's the city's only 2SLGBTQ+ nightclub._

-   **AVOID queer when generic use clashes with an individual's opposition to the term.**

> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in a queer bar._ (REWRITE if the person is known to object to being called queer)
> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in an 2SLGBTQ+ bar._ (OK)
> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in a gay bar._ (OK if the person uses this entrenched wording)



Exercise your own judgment. **When in doubt, generally lean toward 2SLGBTQ+ as the default**, especially in first reference (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ rights, 2SLGBTQ+ refugees).

**Indigiqueer**

The **same approach above applies to variations of the word queer, including Indigiqueer.** The portmanteau is defined in different ways, but it generally refers to **a unique combination of "Indigenous" and "queer" identity** that some people feel isn't always adequately conveyed by "two-spirit." Regina-born artist Theo Jean Cuthand, a trans man and member of the Little Pine First Nation, is credited with coining "Indigiqueer" at a film festival in Vancouver in 2004, although he spelled it "-ige-" instead of "-igi-" at the time to reflect the vowels in the root word Indigenous. The term is now part of a growing list of proper nouns, from the **Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer Studies Guide** at the University of British Columbia to **Full-Metal Indigiqueer** (a 2017 poetry collection) and the **Indigiqueer Circle of Quebec** (a non-profit organization). It's OK to use the original spelling, Indigequeer, when quoting from a verbatim, written source. Otherwise, stick with Indigiqueer for consistency.

**Avoid outmoded uses of 'queer'**

**Steer clear of queer as an archaic synonym for odd or strange** (e.g., "queer weather" and "a queer choice"), unless in a clip or transcribed quote. **At the heart of such dated phrasing is the sense of queer as abnormal** — which is clearly different from, say, other comparatively quaint fossils, such as "gay" to mean festive, colourful or fun (as in "Don we now our gay apparel" from the 19th century Christmas carol, _Deck the Halls_).

**Prefer specific over generic when facts fit**

It's **a good idea to lean toward specific language** whenever practical (e.g., **anti-trans** instead of anti-2SLGBTQ+, and a **homophobic slur** instead of an 2SLGBTQ+ slur), **as long as the narrower focus is accurate.** Otherwise, stick with generic wording (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ activists, and discrimination against the 2SLGBTQ+ community).

**Be aware that some individuals tell us that they feel their identities are being erased by what they perceive as overuse of the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+.** For example, if doctors say **gay men** appear to be more at risk of contracting a virus, we should say so. And if authorities warn that **trans youth** are more likely to take their own lives than other teens, we should report this detail clearly.

**Language that may not be familiar to most of our audience** (asexual, pansexual, polysexual) **should generally be defined when used, with the relevance clearly supplied** (e.g., "Jones considers herself 'polysexual,' saying the word bisexual is too limiting because it implies there are only two genders"). **But do not use wording that's either dated or inaccurate** (e.g., referring to an intersex person as a hermaphrodite).

**Guard against misusing or mischaracterizing terms that you're not familiar with.** For instance, in 2SLGBTQIA+, the A conventionally means asexual. And **while it's accurate to say that asexual people aren't sexually attracted to others, it's overly simplistic to suggest they don't experience other forms of attraction** in certain cases (e.g., romantic or aesthetic). It's also wrong to assume that asexuality is always static as individuals age, or to use "asexual" as a synonym for "celibate."

**Miscellaneous**

**Avoid words such as "admit"** (e.g., "admits being gay"), which suggest an element of wrongdoing. **Reserve expressions such as openly gay or openly lesbian** to rare cases when this detail is essential to keep stories clear or accurate (e.g., when referring to expansion of 2SLGBTQ+ rights in a more tolerant society, or when qualifying a historic election victory by acknowledging that past mayors, premiers, etc., may have been closeted gay men or gay women).

**Be on the lookout for non-standard use of common 2SLGBTQ+ language, attributing any potentially contentious wording as needed.** In June 2023, for example, Johns Hopkins University came under fire for publishing a glossary that defined **"lesbian"** as **"a non-man attracted to non-men."** Critics called the decision to bypass references to women misogynistic. The document was taken off-line, and the school's Office of Diversity and Inclusion said there would be more rigorous editorial oversight of material posted in the future.

**When referring to a same-sex relationship or marriage, follow the individual's preference:** boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, partner, etc. If a preference is unknown, the story's facts are our best guide (e.g., when there's no marriage, a generic word such as "partner" is better than "spouse," which normally implies marriage).

The term homosexual is considered judgmental and offensive by some, since we rarely talk about a "heterosexual" in the same way. **Limit use of the word homosexual to clinical contexts and direct quotations.** Use gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc., instead. By contrast, **the nouns homosexuality, heterosexuality and bisexuality are all fine** in overall discussions about sexuality. The colloquial term **straight** is acceptable as a synonym for heterosexual.

Expressions such as **gay men and women**, **gay people** and the **gay community** are all OK when specifically focused on identities tied to sexual orientation. The description **"gay and bisexual men**" is generally better than "men who have sex with men," because the former neutrally refers to sexual orientation while the latter stresses sexual behaviour. The same applies to "**lesbians and bisexual women**."

**Certain redundancies are deep-rooted and perfectly acceptable** (e.g., the LG in 2SLGBTQ+ refers to "lesbian" and "gay," respectively, even though lesbians are, by definition, gay). English is not always literal or logical, and sometimes a missing word (i.e., gay "man") is both implied and instantly understood. **But avoid needlessly superfluous phrasing**, such as "lesbian woman" (which is repetitive) versus "lesbian firefighter" (which is OK because each element of the compound is distinct).

To bolster inclusiveness, many proper nouns have been formally renamed (e.g., **Pride Month** celebrations, **Pride Week** festivals, and Toronto's **Pride parade**, rather than "Gay Pride Week" festivals and "Gay Pride parade"). It's important, therefore, to verify the official names of organizations and events.

Keep pride lowercase in generic uses only (e.g., "Embrace queer pride," she said). Otherwise, **use uppercase Pride when referring to community events or cultural symbols** (e.g., a **Pride flag**). See [holidays and special times](/home/h/holidays) for related, in-house capitalization guidelines (e.g., time periods, such as Day and Week and Month are uppercase, but generic words such as breakfast, parade, party and fireworks are normally lowercase, as in Labour Day parade). An exception is **Dyke March**, which is historically treated as a compound proper noun.

**2SLGBTQ+ slurs**
**Follow [CBC Journalistic Standards and Practices policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Flanguage-langue-1.4523261&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw00j0MyNt5WClLhwDOEulcB) when handling offensive language**. If you have any doubts, talk to your supervisor.

**Homophobic, anti-trans and related slurs do not automatically need to be censored in stories** (i.e., bleeped on air or masked with hyphens online). **But they must never be gratuitous, and audience warnings should be included.
**



> EXAMPLES: When covering an anti-2SLGBTQ+ protest, there's no hard rule about blurring images of repugnant signs like "God Hates Homos" or "God Hates Fags," or bleeping equally offensive chants in a radio story. The same applies to a controversy over song lyrics, past comments by someone running for political office, and a debate over certain words on TV, including Canadian comedian Scott Thompson's fervent opposition to censoring "faggot." Editorial teams must determine the most appropriate way to handle such language based on our JSP principles, as well as on a given story's facts, assumptions about audience taste levels, etc.


**When making decisions about what to include in stories, it may be helpful to consider the following:**

-   **Paraphrases and general descriptions are sometimes sufficient** to convey key information (e.g., an athlete is accused of using a "homophobic slur"). See also prefer specific over generic above (e.g., anti-trans versus anti-2SLGBTQ+).

-   **If you include [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language), exercise restraint.** There's no need to keep repeating the word or words. For example, it's generally sufficient to report that "faggot" appeared more than a dozen times in two emails, or in several tweets, without bombarding our audience with verbatim citations.

-   Words such as **fag, faggot, homo, dyke, etc., are hateful and hurtful in almost all contexts**, despite various efforts by 2SLGBTQ+ activists to defang the terms though linguistic appropriation. Put another way: Even though "faggot" is commonly used either neutrally or affectionately by some gay people, **audience warnings are required for homophobic slurs.** Entrenched proper nouns devoid of malevolence do NOT require special care (e.g., the comic strip **_Dykes to Watch Out For_** or a **Dyke March** at a Pride festival), but such usage remains relatively rare.

-   **Masking all pejorative usage can result in odd, inconsistent treatment of certain words** (e.g., censoring "Death to Dykes" graffiti in a story about rising anti-2SLGBTQ+ hate in the weeks leading up to a city's annual "Dyke March," or censoring "queer" in one context but not in another).

-   **Leaving homophobic slurs intact on air and online does not, in itself, mean we think the language is inoffensive**. Rather, it's often a matter of deciding whether the language is so out-of-bounds that it must be either axed or sanitized.

-   **Linguists point out that certain words tend to be more shocking than others based in part on "taboo" status** tied to infrequent public use. **We sometimes get complaints from people who think homophobic slurs should almost always be expurgated, along the lines of c--t and n----r. But judging degrees of offence can be highly subjective**. Scholars who study derogatory language say the use of "faggot," "dyke," "queer" and so forth by 2SLGBTQ+ activists has influenced society's overall reaction to these words over the past few decades. **For a detailed comparison of "c--t" versus "faggot" in our journalism, see this [November 2019 reply to an CBC ombudsperon complaint](/media/14pfs2m3/cbcnews_handling-offensive-terms-like-faggot_reply-to-ombud-complaint_nov-2019.pdf)** — which underscores the need to warn audiences when stories include homophobic slurs.



**Historical background** (From LG to 2SLGBTQ+ and beyond)

Nearly 800 years ago, "gay" meant "bright" and "lively" in English, a definition that held fast for more than half a millennium. During the 19th century, "gay" became a nickname for female prostitutes, and by the 1920s, it had morphed into a disdainful label for homosexual men and women. With the rise of the gay rights movement in the 1960s, however, the word was embraced as a symbol of pride rather than as a mark of derision.

The **first known use of the term LGB is from 1985**. There's anecdotal evidence that this was **expanded to include the letter "T" in the late 1980s**, although the earliest recorded written record of **LGBT** and **GLBT** is from **1992**, according to lexicographers at the Oxford English Dictionary. The B stood for "bisexual," and the T represented either "transgender" or "transgendered," depending on the writer. Both abbreviations appeared in early internet forums known as Usenet server newsgroups. The initial posts urged bisexual people to take on louder, more visible roles within what was described as society's non-straight population.

Within a few years, **LGBT became the default name** of the "lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender" community, **although the abbreviation remained uncommon in mainstream news coverage until roughly 2010**. By the mid-2010s, additional letters started appearing. There was no consensus on the best order, however, and certain letters were repeated in an effort to convey different meanings (e.g., T for transgender and T for transexual, Q for queer and Q for questioning, A for asexual and A for allies). A typical cluster in blog posts and emails during this period was: "**LGBTTQQI2SAAP**."

At roughly the same time, a few symbols started surfacing. For instance, some suggested putting an ampersand before the T to distinguish gender identity from sexual orientation (i.e., **LGB&T**). While the & never took hold, a + symbol gained popularity (**LGBTQ+**) because it acknowledged numerous unnamed subcommunities without extending an already long abbreviation with a single syllable: Plus.

In Canada, **"two-spirit" didn't start routinely appearing in the abbreviation in mainstream news coverage until about 2017**, initially as the number 2 (i.e., **LGBTQ2**) before expanding to 2S. While LGBTQ2S+ is used by some people now, the abbreviation has frequently appeared as **2SLGBTQ+** since 2022.



**EXAMPLES OF PROPER NOUNS IN MOTION:** In 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a proclamation affirming June as "**Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+) Pride Month**" ― a decade after U.S. President Barack Obama had first declared June "**Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month**," and 20 years after Bill Clinton had designated it "**Lesbian and Gay Pride Month**." Meanwhile, the U.S.-based **National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association** (NLGJA), founded in 1991, officially changed its name to the **Association of LGBT Journalists** in 2013, to the **Association of LGBTQ Journalists** in 2016, and then to the **Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists** in February of 2023.



**2SLGBTQ+ GLOSSARY**

**agender** — A person who doesn't identify with a specific gender (e.g., woman or man). Sometimes considered distinct from [non-binary](#glossary-non-binary), which usually implies a blend of, or a fluidity between, traditional binary labels.

**asexual** — Someone who is not sexually attracted to others, although they may still experience other forms of attraction, such as romantic or aesthetic.

**biological** — Generally limit to medical or scientific contexts (e.g., biological research, biological instincts, biological weapons, a person's biological mother). In stories about the transgender community, avoid use of the modifier to classify individuals (e.g., do not talk about a "biological man" or "a biological female") unless attributed. See the [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-at-birth "Transgender") for details.

**bisexual** — Someone attracted to men and women. While the clipped form bi can be OK in second reference, depending on a story's overall tone, it can be perceived as a breezy colloquialism that's sometimes better suited to attribution.

**cisgender** — Someone who is **not transgender**. OK as long as the meaning is clear. While it can be a highly succinct way to cover certain stories (e.g., medical findings involving transgender and cisgender patients), not everyone is familiar with the word, and not all cisgender want to be referred to this way. See transgender overview for more details on [cisgender usage](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#cisgender "Transgender").

**cross-dresser** — Someone who wears clothing traditionally associated with a different gender. **Do not use the outdated term "transvestite."** Cross-dressing is unrelated to sexual orientation, and might not be tied to any erotic fetish. Generic use of the term cross-dresser is fine, but avoid applying to specific individuals unless they use the term themselves. Guard against inaccuracy when referring to gender expression. In particular, while cisgender people may cross-dress, transgender people simply dress. (Compare with [drag performer](#glossary-drag-performer) below.)

**deadnaming** — Calling a transgender person by their former name (usually their birth name). Be aware that not all transgender people consider their old identities completely "dead" for various reasons. **CBC News style is to use a transgender person's current name in virtually all cases.** Exceptions are rare, and, even then, the former name should be used only once for a clear editorial reason. (See [former names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#former-names "Transgender") in the transgender overview for details.)

**drag performer** — An entertainer who dresses and acts like someone of a different gender. Specific usage is common and OK (e.g., a **female impersonator** is a **drag queen**, and a **male impersonator** is a **drag king**). Drag performers sometimes rely on elaborate costumes and exaggerated comportment during shows. While it's accurate to refer to them as **cross-dressing entertainers**, do not use the term drag performer as a simple synonym for cross-dresser.

**female, male** — Primarily adjectives indicating people's sex. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overivew.)

**gender** — Although gender has several meanings (e.g., masculine and feminine groupings in grammar), the word usually refers to society's classification of people under the historically binary headings of woman or man. This gender classification, in turn, is traditionally tied directly to one's sex at birth (female or male). That's why gender labels are considered cultural while sex labels are considered biological. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overview, as well as [non-binary](#glossary-non-binary) below.)

**gender identity** — A person's subjective sense of their own connection, or lack of connection, to the gender category (woman, man) assigned to them at birth based on their sex (female, male). Since cisgender people report feeling a strong link between their gender and their sex, experts say they can have difficulty understanding the incongruence felt by transgender people. (See [gender dysphoria](#glossary-gender-dysphoria) below.)

**gender dysphoria** — A medical term that refers to a person's inner conflict and deep unhappiness over their assigned gender, including society's perception of who they are. It **has replaced the now-discredited 1980s psychiatric label "gender identity disorder," which should not be used.** The word dysphoria is the opposite of euphoria and underscores the depths of depression that doctors may refer to in a given diagnosis. This is important because it means the medical focus is on the distress someone feels over the incongruence between their gender identity (brain) and their biological sex (body), rather than on now-rejected notions of a psychological disorder. The most common reason for including the term gender dysphoria in a news story is when the diagnosis is required in a given jurisdiction before certain medical care (e.g., hormone therapy or surgery) can be approved. (See [gender-affirming care](#glossary-gender-affirming-care) below.)

**gender-affirming care** — A common and OK term for a range of medical treatments tied to transitioning, from hormone therapy to gender surgery. Alternative expressions such as **gender-confirming care** are also fine, although some wording is now widely considered dated (e.g., gender reassignment) and, so, should be attributed. **Do not use the archaic term "sex change" operation**, which focuses on the body (sex) instead of on the person's gender identity. See [transitioning](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#transition "Transgender") for details.

**intersex** — Someone born with a body that falls outside of traditional, binary sex categorization (genitalia, chromosomes). Being intersex can include a discrepancy between external and internal reproductive organs, or a combination (e.g., both ovarian and testicular tissue). **Do not confuse with non-binary or transgender. Avoid the outdated label hermaphrodite.**

**man, woman** — Primarily nouns indicating gender identity. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overivew.)

**misgendering** — To misstate someone's gender identity, usually by using the wrong pronoun. It can be done intentionally or unintentionally. Since the term, coined in 1989, remains unfamiliar to many in our audience, it's often clearer to describe the act rather than to rely on a one-word label (e.g., misstating a person's gender, referring to someone by the wrong gender, using the wrong pronoun).

**non-binary** — A person who doesn't strictly identify as a woman or a man. Includes those who are gender-fluid (i.e., whose gender identity may fluctuate), but not necessarily those who are [agender](#glossary-agender) (i.e., who say they don't have a gender). While the term is NOT narrowly synonymous with transgender, **some transgender people are non-binary, and use pronouns other than she or he** (e.g., "they/their"). See [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#pronouns "Transgender") for related guidelines.

**queer** — An umbrella term used by many, but not all, members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community to describe themselves. The root term also appears in some words that specify a narrower meaning (e.g., **genderqueer** focuses on gender identity, which has nothing to do with sexual orientation). Be mindful that some people object to being called queer. When referring to specific individuals, respect known preferences. (See '[Queer' requires caution](#queer) above for details.)

**sex** — A biological classification (female, male) usually tied to reproductive organs. Sex is distinct from gender, which is a societal designation historically assigned to individuals based on their binary sex classification at birth. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overview.)

**sexual orientation** — Refers to the gender or genders of people we're sexually attracted to (e.g., to men, women, both, neither). Include in stories only when relevant. **Avoid the dated and inaccurate term "sexual preference,"** which wrongly implies that one's sexual orientation is a "lifestyle choice." The most common categories are gay (men attracted to men), lesbian (women attracted women), bisexual (attracted to men and women), straight (men attracted to women, women attracted to men), and asexual (not sexually attracted to others).

**transgender** — A person whose identity does not match the gender classification traditionally linked to the sex (female, male) they were assigned at birth. Report this detail only when relevant to a story (e.g., a transgender man, a transgender woman). Go with the name and pronouns the individual uses. Being transgender is unrelated to sexual orientation. The colloquial short form **trans** is often OK in stories, especially in second reference (e.g., a trans lawyer). See the [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/ "Transgender") for details and related guidelines.

**transexual** — **Avoid outside of direct attribution** (e.g., when citing historical documents, or when people currently describe themselves this way). For many years, the term referred to what we now call transgender individuals undergoing certain medical care (usually hormone therapy as well as surgery). Although the word transsexual was relatively common during the mid-20th century, it's now generally perceived as old-fashioned because it stresses "sex" over "gender" in a way that's at odds with how transitioning is conventionally discussed in the 21st century.

**transvestite** — **Do not use.** (See [cross-dresser](#glossary-cross-dresser) above.)

**two-spirit** — A broad label used by some Indigenous people who describe themselves having both masculine and feminine spirits. It's defined in different ways by various people, and can refer to gender identity as well as sexual orientation. **Do not apply to non-Indigenous people.** (See [2SLGBTQ](#2S) above for details.)


**NOTE:** This glossary covers various words that routinely appear in our journalism, or that have sometimes caused confusion. But it does not include every term used in the 2SLGBTQ+ community. **Be aware that some labels can muddy attempts at precision** — such as **pansexual** (often defined as people attracted to others regardless of their sex or gender), **omnisexual** (sometimes defined as people attracted to others regardless of their sex but for whom gender may be a consideration), and **polysexual** (sometimes defined as people attracted to those of any sexual orientation but not necessarily to any gender identity). Since many in our audience may not be familiar with these terms, and since there's not always consensus over the actual denotative and connotative meanings, **a good practice is to skip such labels and lean toward clear descriptions to avoid ambiguity** (e.g. "Mia says prefers to date lesbians, but is also attracted to some bisexual men").

### lakes

**Lake versus lake**

**Capitalize the generic word "lake" only when it's part of a proper name.**

Chad Lake
Great Slave Lake
Lake Superior
Lake Ontario
Lake Louise
the Great Lakes
the Lakes (all of the Great Lakes)

**Use a lowercase "l" when referring to only one of the Great Lakes in second reference:**

the lake (in a story about Lake Huron)

**Use lowercase in plural constructions, _unless_ the plural also represents a proper name:**

several lakes
three of the Great Lakes
lakes Superior, Huron and Ontario

### Last Post

**the _Last Post_ versus _Taps_**

In the Canadian and British military, **the final of several bugle calls marking the time to retire for the night is the _Last Post_.** It is distinct from _First Post_, which would traditionally be played earlier.

**_Rouse_ and _Reveille_ are signals to rise in the morning.** NOTE: The names of these "morning" calls are now used interchangeably in the Commonwealth, even though the original (_Reveille_) is technically longer.

_Last Post_ is also played to remember soldiers and other service personnel who died in wars. The haunting notes are normally sounded by a lone bugler or, occasionally, by a single trumpeter.

At military ceremonies, including funerals, **Canadians play the _Last Post_. Americans, by contrast, play _Taps_.** According to government of Canada protocol booklets, **_Reveille_ is also usually played at Remembrance Day ceremonies.**

**Use the specific noun "call" rather than inapt terms such as "song" or "tune"** when referring to the _Last Post and_ _Reveille_.

### Latin plurals

**Latin plurals**

When deciding whether a word is singular or plural we should do more than look at its roots. **Latin rules do not govern English.** Otherwise, as U.S. author Bill Bryson once noted, we would all be buying insurance premia and watching athletes play in stadia.

Some people, for instance, still insist that data is plural based on its etymology. But it sounds stilted to say, "_The data are not reliable._"

Although reputable dictionaries continue to list archaic words such as aquaria, podia and symposia, we use the more common forms (aquariums, podiums and and symposiums). Sometimes, two versions are spoken and written (millennia and millenniums), and a preference is largely arbitrary (millenniums). 

 **CBC News preferences**

 

 

 **addenda**

 plural

 The addenda include a major addendum.

 singular and plural

 The bacteria is spreading.
 No harmful viruses or bacteria were detected.

 **criteria**

 plural

 The criteria are clear. A key criterion.

 **curricula**

 plural

 It's a blend of several different curricula. \*

 singular

 The data is out of date.

 **dictums**

 plural

 Their latest dictums are unpopular.

 **indexes**

 plural

 The word indexes is more common than indices.

 plural

 The media have been banned from the courtroom.

 **memorandums**

 plural

 Memos are another word for memorandums.

 **moratoriums**

 plural

 They've imposed three moratoriums in five years.

 **referendums**

 plural

 The province has held several referendums. †

 **strata**

 plural

 Geologists study many strata of rock deposits.

\* Writers and editors are encouraged to prefer conversational constructions over unnatural ones. For instance, the Canadian Oxford does not even list "curriculums" as a possible plural. Instead of writing "_a blend of several different curricula,_" however, it would be better to recast the sentence. An option might be something as specific as: "_Three provinces have blended different courses into a shared Grade 10 math curriculum._"


† See also [referendums versus plebiscites](/home/r/referendum-versus-plebiscite)


**A grain of salt**
During the past few decades, many people have relaxed their views on how to handle some Latin words. One widely used rule of thumb is to treat the word as singular when it represents something we generally think of in bulk or as a group. It can be thought of as the sodium chloride test:

"Salt is" being poured into the tank.
"Salt granules are" being poured into the tank.

Preserving the Latin plural is useful if we mean a bunch of individual parts. So various criteria could include a key criterion, and different strata (e.g., geological formations, layers of atmosphere, classes of society) are often worth examining separately.


**Datum? What’s dat?**
In the case of data, most of us don’t think of each individual datum (an obsolete term). Instead, we associate the word _data_ with an entire cluster of numbers.

> _The data they collected are flawed._
>
> _The data they collected is flawed._ (preferred)
>
> _The data are almost ready._
>
> _The data is almost ready._ (preferred)

**Media are ...**
We may not think about each datum in a cluster, but many of us still distinguish between various media (the print medium, the broadcast medium, the internet, etc.). It’s akin to preserving "criterion" as one of the many "criteria."

Others, however, think of the news media as one group, along the lines of "the press." So, depending on one’s view, we end up with different approaches:

> _The media has improved its coverage._
>
> _The media have improved their coverage._ (preferred)


For consistency, CBC News prefers to treat media as a plural (_media are, media have_, etc.).


**Bacteria are ... Bacteria is ...**
Since bacterium is singular, the word bacteria must be plural, ipso facto. Or so said he (_ipse dixit_). But Latin is dead, and the debate over bacteria is very much alive.

While some language authorities recommend keeping bacteria plural, others acknowledge the increasingly common use of bacteria as a singular, too, as in "_The bacteria has mutated and is making us ill_" (rather than "_The bacteria have mutated and are making us ill_").

The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage recognizes bacteria as both singular and plural. Since the word is far more conversational than "bacterium," bacteria is not merely acceptable in news stories, it's often the better choice:


**bacteria (singular), commonly means "a strain of bacteria"**


> _The bacteria is spreading quickly. It seems to infect every age group._
>
> (NOT_: The bacteria are spreading quickly. They seem to infect ..._)

**bacteria (plural), means "different strains of bacteria"**


> _She's spent her scientific career looking at viruses and bacteria._


If you're uncomfortable writing "bacteria is" because of its Latin roots, remember that we say "agenda is" rather than "agenda are." If you're still not convinced, reword your story to avoid odd-looking or awkward-sounding sentences. Instead of writing "_These bacteria have scientists stumped,_" for example, try "_This strain of bacteria has scientists stumped._"

The objective isn’t merely good grammar. Clarity is a goal, too, and wording that sounds natural helps. This is why most major news organizations abandoned referenda, memoranda, etc., years ago.

### Latin (scientific names)

**Latin** (scientific names)

**Generally avoid formal scientific names** (e.g., _Aix galericulata_ instead of mandarin duck) except in news stories or features that benefit from such language (e.g., when specific scholarly research is cited).

**When Latin names are used for animals, plants, etc. capitalize only the first word**, known as the genus. **This is true even when the second term, the species, is based on a word that is normally capitalized** (e.g., _canadensis_ for Canada).

_Branta canadensis_ for Canada goose
_Cannabis sativa_ and _Cannabis indica_ for two common species of hemp ([marijuana](/home/m#marijuana))
_Castor fiber canadensis_ for Canadian beaver
_Homo sapiens_ for modern humans
_Orcinus orca_ for killer whale
_Taraxacum officinale_ for dandelion

**A subspecies, also lowercase, appears last:
**
_Homo sapiens neanderthalenis
Branta canadensis leucopareia_

**In the above examples, the entire Latin name should be in [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).** Different guidelines apply to bacteria, diseases, etc. (See below)

**Even in science stories, it is rarely necessary to expand beyond genus and species to other taxonomic classifications**, such as domain (_Eucarya_), kingdom (_Animalia_), phylum (_Chordata_), subphylum (_Vertebrata_), class (_Mammalia_), order (_Primates_), and family (_Hominidae_).

In these cases, the scientific names themselves are capitalized but common words derived from them (nouns or adjectives) are not (e.g., vertebrate and primate). The Canadian Oxford is a good guide.


**Bacteria, diseases, etc.**
**Do NOT italicize common names of diseases, viruses, parasitic micro-organisms, etc.** (e.g, coliform, listeriosis and rickettsia). **Do NOT capitalize the generic names of bacteria**, such as bacillus or streptococcus, **or the proper scientific names of diseases such as BSE** (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

**Generally italicize all Latin scientific jargon that features an uppercase genus**, including the formal and full name of bacteria:

> They also found _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the corkscrew-shaped bacterium that causes Lyme disease.


**But when the genus is familiar** (Listeria) **or abbreviated** (e.g., E. coli stands for _Escherichia coli_), **do not italicize**.

**If bacteria is widely known** (e.g., E. coli), **the shortened version is fine on first reference.** Otherwise, spell it out once (e.g., _Clostridium difficile_, which can be called C. difficile from that point on in the story). Clipped versions are also fine in headlines.

When relevant, mention the specific strain of bacteria high up in the story, such as **E. coli O157: H7** (Note: The O is the letter "O" not a zero.) Never assume people know what the numbers and letters mean. The sentence should make it clear that this label represents a specific strain.

### lay versus lie

**Lay versus lie**

Two of the more confusing words in English involve repose, mainly because "lay" also happens to be the past tense of "lie."

The spelling **"layed" is ALWAYS WRONG.** There's no such word in standard English. The correct verb is **either "laid"** (past tense of "lay") **or "lay"** (past tense of lie).

**Picking the correct word depends entirely on a given sentence's meaning and syntax.**

**Lay**
Lay is an action word. It's a "transitive verb," which means it **needs an object**. In other words, **you must specify what is being laid down**: a baby, groceries, the law. ("_She lay her son in the crib._") Its main forms are "**lay**" (present), "**laying**" (present participle), and "**laid**" (past as well as past participle.)

Hens **lay eggs**. Workers **lay bricks**. Collectors want to **lay their hands** on rare finds.


**Lie**
Lie is an "intransitive verb," which means it **does not take an object.** It applies to people or things being in a horizontal position. ("_He lies on a soft sofa._") Its main forms are "**lie**" (present), "**lying**" (present participle), "**lay**" (past), and "**lain**" (past participle.)

Vacationers **lie on beaches.** Insomniacs **lie awake**. Bodies **lie in state**.

Her dog will faithfully **lie down**, but ignores commands to "lay down" because it's a stickler for grammar.

NOTE: The term **"lied" is ALWAYS WRONG as the past participle of lie when we mean a horizontal state. The correct form is "lain."** The word "lied," by contrast, refers to not telling the truth.

The intransitive verb lie also means to be in a certain location or relationship (e.g., the **island lies off the coast**, more **treasure lies below**, our **sympathies lie with them**, and **blame lies elsewhere**).


**'Now I lay me down to sleep'**
Given the above, **the intransitive verb "lie" is almost always correct when referring to people asleep or at rest** (e.g., _"The faithful lie down in green pastures,"_ and _"It's best to let sleeping dogs lie"_). **The exception is when we're describing someone or something being placed into a position of rest.** In that case, the object (e.g., a baby) requires the transitive verb lay ("_She gently laid her child on the hospital bed_"). The same logic is behind the entrenched expression, "_Now I lay me down to sleep._"

If you’re not sure which form to use, take a look at the table below:

**LAY**

 

 Present

 I lay the map on the desk. I am laying the map on the desk.

 Past

 Last week, I laid the map on the desk.

 Present Perfect

 I have already laid the map on the desk.



 **LIE** 

 

 Present

 I lie on the grass. I am lying on the grass. The book is lying on the table. Trudeau lies in state.

 Past

 Last night, I lay on the grass. Snow lay on the ground.

 Present Perfect

 I have lain on the grass all afternoon.

If you’re still uncertain, pick a different word.

### Leader

**Leader versus leader**


The generic word "leader" is rarely an official title. There are many types of leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chiefs, and so forth.

Unless it's part of a formal title, therefore, **capitalize "leader" only when (a) it's linked directly to a political party** (in this case it's a semi-official title) **and (b) it appears immediately before a name:**

> Conservative Leader Stephen Harper
>
> NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh
>
> Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau
>
> Green Party co-Leader Jonathan Pedneault
>
> Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (See [U.S. Congress](/home/c/congress) for related guidelines)
>
> Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (see [U.S. Congress](/home/c/congress) for related guidelines)
>
> but the Liberal leader, the Tory leader, the Senate majority leader, party leader Elizabeth May, etc.
>
> Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
>
> Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas


Note: CBCNews.ca uses "Party" rather than "party" in abridged nouns that retain most of the original party's full, formal name (e.g., Green Party rather than CP's approach of Green party but Green Party of Canada). This style, adopted in September 2009, avoids inconsistent treatment of party leaders within a story. Under CP's rules, for example, it's Green party Leader Elizabeth May. CBC, however, now goes with the much simpler style: Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.
**
Follow normal capitalization style if someone is appointed to the position for a specified period** (i.e., distinguish between acting and [interim](/home/a/acting-versus-interim)):

> interim Liberal Leader Bill Graham (appointed until a convention can be held to choose a permanent replacement)


**But keep "leader" lowercase if the person no longer holds the title, if it's only a very temporary post, or if it's merely a political job performed by a federal or provincial politician who is not actually the party's leader** (e.g., government House leader):

> former NDP leader Jack Layton
>
> deputy leader Dave Broadfoot
>
> Liberal deputy leader Ralph Goodale
>
> Ontario NDP deputy leader Megan Leslie
>
> acting Conservative leader Jill Wong (filling in only briefly if, say, someone is ill)
>
> House leader Monty Hall (federal)
>
> House leader Monty Burns (provincial)

### left-wing versus right-wing

**Left-wing and right-wing**

**The labels "left" and "right" require caution.** For example, **the broad terms "left-wing" and "right-wing" are often too imprecise to be meaningful**, especially when used to describe people rather than actual policies. **But the relatively narrower terms "far-left" and "far-right" are entrenched and widely understood by our audience in certain contexts.** The rest of this entry outlines our style and recommended best practice.

[**left, right**](/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing#left-right) (common political umbrellas)
[**left-wing, right-wing**](/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing#left-right-wing) (generally avoid; specific party affiliation often preferred)
[**far left, far right**](/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing#far-left-far-right) (OK when facts fit and context is clear)

**Left, right (political umbrellas)**
When applied to political parties, the words mean **"to the left"** or **"to the right" of a traditional public policy spectrum**. The expressions are believed to be based on seating arrangements in legislative chambers in Europe a few hundred years ago. Today, the terms generally convey ideological differences about the size and role of government, as well as about the perceived societal costs and benefits of free markets, regulations, etc.

**This common and frequently acceptable shorthand** (left, right) **can instantly help our audience understand certain stories.** In Canada, for example, the phrase "unite the right" came to mean a movement at the start of the 21st century to [bring together two federal parties](/home/p/party) (the Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance).

**When branding a party or policies, the words conventionally mean socialist (left) and conservative (right).** In a specific party name, terms such as Socialist and Conservative will often be capitalized (e.g., France’s Socialist Party, and the Conservative Party of Canada) but may not appear at all (e.g., Canada’s NDP, Britain’s Labour Party, the Saskatchewan Party).



**Left-wing, right-wing (generally avoid)**
**Labels such as "left-wing" and "right-wing" have large limits and, so, are often a poor choice.** For example, deeply cutting public spending to balance a budget is often called a "right-wing policy," but the approach may actually be adopted by a wide range of parties (e.g., the Liberals in Ottawa or the NDP in Saskatchewan during the mid-1990s).

**If you pigeonhole a person as "left-wing" or "right-wing,"** several problems can arise. First, **the terms may be seen as inaccurate** and the tone perceived as pejorative. Many people who hold public office are convinced that their views are mainstream (in the middle of a spectrum that they believe in, not on the periphery of a spectrum that academics or journalists have constructed).

Second, **each party has moderates**. So classifying people into one group or another can be misleading. A Conservative believes in Conservative ideology, but the person may have either conservative or liberal views on various topics. A Liberal believes in Liberal ideology, but the person may have either liberal or conservative views on various topics.

**In stories about public figures in Canada**, identifying someone as right-wing or left-wing can prompt email from people who dispute the label. **It’s more neutral and generally just as effective to identify specific party affiliations** (a Tory, a Liberal, a New Democrat, etc.).

**The same principle applies to think-tanks and related organizations**. When identifying the authors of studies, the participants of a CBC panel, etc., **prefer using proper nouns alone**, such as: the Fraser Institute, the C.D. Howe Institute, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Wellesley Institute, the Broadbent Institute. **This avoids accusations of inaccuracy** (e.g., if a given group straddles left-right positions) **as well as inconsistency** (e.g., if we use “right-wing” in some cases but no modifier in others).

**When there's room and editorial need for context, a given body’s political leaning can normally be telegraphed by specific mention of policy/advocacy positions** (e.g., _ABC think-tank recommends policies UVW and XYZ_). Another option is to use attribution (e.g., "_which group JKL calls "pro-business_" or "_anti-business_") when two sides are squabbling over specific policies and think-tanks, and whether a given organization is truly non-partisan.



**Far-left, far-right**
**These classifications describe fringes of the political spectrum within a capitalist democracy. “Far left” traditionally refers to anti-capitalism ideology, such as communism.** Proponents commonly favour state ownership of large companies within an economy, as well as limiting the ownership of private property, profit-driven investments, etc. **"Far left" can also mean being actively anti-fascist** (i.e., beyond customary or mainstream opposition to fascism). **“Far right” traditionally refers to ultra-nationalist ideology, such as fascism.** Proponents commonly favour highly restrictive immigration policies, as well as openly racist philosophies (e.g., preferential citizenship that depends on ethnicity, religion, etc.). The compounds are hyphenated (**far-left, far-right**) when used as adjectives, as in far-right rhetoric.

**It’s common and acceptable to use the terms “far left” and “far right” to describe extreme political movements, including people participating at a given rally, as long as the facts fit the story** (e.g., _a far-right protest that turned deadly_ in Charlottesville, Va., _the violent, far-left tactics of Antifa_ began in Germany in the 1930s, and _the far-right group [La Meute](/home/l#La_Meute)_ says multiculturalism threatens Quebec’s culture and society). **But avoid simplistically branding single issues** (abortion, animal rights, human rights, Indigenous land claims, the environment) **as "left" or "right" extremism. Prefer more precise language in those cases** (e.g., an anti-abortion activist, an environmental activist).

**Whenever possible, include brief detail that helps our audience understand what we mean by our use of the labels far-left and far-right** (e.g., protesters were chanting antisemitic slogans, the demonstrators advocate various forms of [white nationalism](/home/w#white_nationalism), such as segregated schools and housing, the group is calling for an immigration ban against Muslims). **Generally avoid euphemistic jargon unless it’s relevant and explained** (e.g., _While some in the crowd called themselves “American nationalists” and “racial realists,” they all openly endorsed white supremacist ideology_).

**Neither "far-left" nor "far-right" automatically means the use of violence. Instead, a word such as “extremist” or “militant” is usually added to describe those prepared to harm others** while fighting for their political beliefs. (For related guidelines, see [fundamentalist, extremist, militant, rebel](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist)) Governments and police forces sometimes publish lists of protest movements and groups they accuse of violence or other illegal activity. In Canada, for instance, the RCMP's [Awareness Guide to Extremist Groups](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rcmp-grc.gc.ca%2Fqc%2Fpub%2Fsn-ns%2Fge-eg-eng.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3eOr_wOl4L9C6HgJC83JY8) includes both far-left and far-right networks.



**Politics abroad**
While we can assume that Canadians have at least some sense of where the NDP or the Conservatives are on the political spectrum, we should not expect them to be as familiar with parties in most other countries , beyond, perhaps, the traditional ones in the United States and Britain.

**In stories about political leaders in many other spots around the globe, identifying someone as a member of a group that’s "right-wing," "left-wing," "far-right" etc. can be helpful** to our readers. **But the label must be accurate:** "_Joerg Haider, the leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party ..._"

Attribution is an option, although the standard guidelines about fairness and avoiding libel apply. It's one thing to repeat general criticism of politicians' policies, for instance, and quite another to call themHitlers, etc.

Here's another example of when "far-right" is fine. Careful readers will notice that Haider is not actually labelled a Nazi: _"Joerg Haider was forced to resign as governor of the southern province of Carinthia in 1991 after praising Nazi employment policies. Protesters say his far-right views are both a danger and an embarrassment to Austria."_

**General uses of "parliament" are lowercase** (e.g., France's parliament, Russia's parliament). **Translations are also lowercase** (the Sejm but the Polish parliament, and the Knesset but Israel's parliament) even when the original term is not provided (e.g., Georgia's parliament). **Plurals, adjectives and other derivatives are also lowercase**: e.g. the Canadian and British parliaments (_not_ Parliaments), parliamentary and parliamentarian.

**But use a lowercase "l" and "b" in plural constructions.**

the Alberta and Saskatchewan legislatures

the Alberta and Saskatchewan legislative buildings

The official names of Canada's legislatures vary from region to region. **It's unnecessary to use the formal nouns** (e.g., the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories or the Ontario Provincial Parliament). **Shorter, common names are acceptable** (the N.W.T. Legislature, the Ontario Legislature). Although not technically the official proper nouns, capitalize these in the same way. **Entrenched nicknames are fine, too, although generally in second reference only** (e.g., Queen's Park for the Ontario Legislature).

NOTE: This style change was adopted by CBC News in April 2014. It diverges from CP's traditional lowercase approach (e.g., Manitoba legislature, Quebec national assembly). Using capital letters treats national and provincial/territorial legislative bodies equally in Canada. It also makes scanning these proper nouns easier (Manitoba Legislature, Quebec National Assembly).

**But keep the words legislature, assembly, etc., lowercase when on their own.**

### LGBT

**Overview**
**Sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., should be referred to only when relevant.** In 2010, for example, the following headline appeared in the CBC News Network TV crawl: "2 gay men in Vancouver quit jobs after winning lottery." The text was strikingly inapt, which we immediately acknowledged in our response to an ombudsman complaint.

**Avoid dated and inaccurate expressions** such as "sexual preference" and "alternative lifestyle" **that wrongly imply sexual orientation boils down to choice.**

**2SLGBTQ+ is our default term** in general news stories (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ rights). **It does NOT need to be spelled out** as two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.

**Opt for precise language when the facts fit** (e.g., a homophobic slur versus a 2SLGBTQ+ slur, anti-trans versus anti-2SLGBTQ+). See [prefer specific over generic](#preferspecific) below for details.

**Consider the word queer** as a synonym in some contexts. (See ['](##queer "LGBTQ (1) --- Revised --- DRAFT")[Queer' requires caution](#queer)).

People are **transgender**, not "transgendered." **Being transgender has nothing to do with sexual orientation.** A transgender person could be gay, straight, bisexual, asexual, etc. (See [transgender](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/ "Transgender") for related guidelines, including use of pronouns.)

**EVOLVING TERMINOLOGY:** All English is organic, but some areas change faster than others, including words and phrases tied to the 2SLGBTQ+ community. We will continue to revise our style as required to reflect current, common usage. **This entry is based on recommendations by the CBC News language advisory group.** It was last updated in **February 2024**.

**2SLGBTQ+**

**Use 2SLGBTQ+ as the default umbrella term in most stories**, even in second reference (**2SLGBTQ+ rights**, and members of **the 2SLGBTQ+ community**). The abbreviation **does NOT need to be spelled out** as _two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer_. **Shorter variations are OK when attributed** (e.g., in directly transcribed clips and the names of groups or events). 

**Generally use 2SLGBTQ+, even in stories outside of Canada** (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ activists in Europe, China's 2SLGBTQ+ community). This approach simplifies our style, acknowledges two-spirit people within Indigenous communities around the globe, and frames stories in a way that is familiar to our Canadian audience.

**2SLGBTQ+ is suitable as a modifier in plural constructions** (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ athletes, 2SLGBTQ+ writers, 2SLGBTQ+ lawyers). **But generally avoid the abbreviation in singular references to individuals**. For instance, instead of writing "Jane is 2SLGBTQ+," report the specific detail that's relevant to a given story (e.g., Jane is a gay athlete, Jane is a bisexual politician, Jane is a trans lawyer).

It's now a convention to **include the + sign to underscore that the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ alone does not cover all members of the community.** While the Q, itself, is now usually assumed to be short for "queer" rather than for "questioning," not everyone views the Q as all-encompassing. 

**It's usually unnecessary to add characters after +**, outside of direct attribution. **It's also important to understand the downside of density.** While the instinct of well-intentioned journalists can be to keep tacking on letters to bolster inclusivity, such as A for asexual and I for intersex (2SLGBTQ2SIA+), **the price paid includes (i) alienating various groups** not represented in the expanded abbreviation, **and (ii) making broadcast scripts far less conversational** — not only harder to read on air but also more difficult for our audience to digest.

**Avoid implying that 2SLGBTQ+ includes "allies."** It may be relevant to mention supporters (allies) in stories. But the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+ becomes virtually meaningless if it's so broadly defined that only intolerant people are left out. At the end of the day, a cisgender, straight person may be a vocal advocate for gay and trans rights, but that doesn't make the individual part of the 2SLGBTQ+ community.

**Do not call 2SLGBTQ+ or any of its variations an "[acronym](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/acronyms/ "Acronyms"),"** which traditionally means a pronounceable term like NASA and UNICEF. The fact that the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+ is not an acronym is central to the challenge speakers face when letters or other characters are added.

**TIP:** To sound as natural as possible on air, **broadcast journalists unaccustomed to saying 2SLGBTQ+ should practice the abbreviation** until it becomes as second nature to say as any other eight-syllable sequence (e.g., "heterosexuality" and "individualization").

**Two-spirit (2S)**

The adjective **two-spirit (2S)**, coined in the early 1990s, is **a broad label used by some Indigenous people who describe themselves having both masculine and feminine spirits.** It has different meanings to different individuals, according to [researchers at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://lgbtqhealth.ca/community/two-spirit.php). **Two-spirit can refer to sexual orientation as well as to a wide range of gender identities**. Furthermore, the meaning is not static, as noted in this [2021 CBC Radio feature](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/how-two-spirit-people-are-coming-in-to-their-communities-1.6272654) by _Unreserved_.

**Two-spirit should not be applied to non-Indigenous people.** Given how familiar the term has become, **it no longer needs to be defined in most stories, as long as the context makes the meaning clear**. When spelled out, use two-spirit rather than "two-spirited" (e.g., a two-spirit person, and a collection of poems by two-spirit writers).


(For use of **Indigiqueer**, see ['Queer' requires caution](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#queer "2SLGBTQ+") below.)

**'Queer' requires caution**

**Queer has been embraced by many members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community as an umbrella term** to describe themselves. **But it remains offensive to others and, so, demands care.**

**Champions of the word queer believe that widespread usage will numb its derogatory sting**, in the same way that "gay" eventually morphed from an insult into a label of pride. They also point out that queer is much easier to say than 2SLGBTQ+ or its variants, which fills a needed gap until an actual acronym is coined that catches on (i.e., until a new, pronounceable abbreviation gains far-flung currency ). **Opponents say they continue to see and hear the term queer as a slight**, given its common meaning of "odd" or "strange" as well as its history as a pejorative used against the 2SLGBTQ+ community. **Informal surveys suggest there's a generational divide between these two camps, with an increasing number of young people embracing "queer" as a convenient, neutral description.**

**Queer is OK in CBC journalism when we're covering organizations or people who use the term themselves.** This can range from proper nouns (e.g., the 2019 graphic novel **Gender Queer**, the 2018 TV series **Queer Eye**, the 2017 documentary **Queer Nation**) to individuals talking about being genderqueer, or about being part of Canada's queer community. **But we should avoid using queer when specifically referring to any person or group known to object to the term.** EXAMPLES:

-   **Queer OK in profiles of people who refer to themselves this way.**

> > _As a queer director, she says she brings a different perspective to films._

-   **Queer OK in broadcast clips and directly transcribed quotes**, as long as meaning is not hateful.

> > _"Queer voters like us can spot homophobic politicians a mile away."_

-   **Queer OK as an unattributed umbrella term in certain generic contexts.**

> > _It's the city's only queer nightclub._
> > _It's the city's only 2SLGBTQ+ nightclub._

-   **AVOID queer when generic use clashes with an individual's opposition to the term.**

> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in a queer bar._ (REWRITE if the person is known to object to being called queer)
> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in an 2SLGBTQ+ bar._ (OK)
> > _He was in his mid-30s before setting foot in a gay bar._ (OK if the person uses this entrenched wording)



Exercise your own judgment. **When in doubt, generally lean toward 2SLGBTQ+ as the default**, especially in first reference (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ rights, 2SLGBTQ+ refugees).

**Indigiqueer**

The **same approach above applies to variations of the word queer, including Indigiqueer.** The portmanteau is defined in different ways, but it generally refers to **a unique combination of "Indigenous" and "queer" identity** that some people feel isn't always adequately conveyed by "two-spirit." Regina-born artist Theo Jean Cuthand, a trans man and member of the Little Pine First Nation, is credited with coining "Indigiqueer" at a film festival in Vancouver in 2004, although he spelled it "-ige-" instead of "-igi-" at the time to reflect the vowels in the root word Indigenous. The term is now part of a growing list of proper nouns, from the **Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer Studies Guide** at the University of British Columbia to **Full-Metal Indigiqueer** (a 2017 poetry collection) and the **Indigiqueer Circle of Quebec** (a non-profit organization). It's OK to use the original spelling, Indigequeer, when quoting from a verbatim, written source. Otherwise, stick with Indigiqueer for consistency.

**Avoid outmoded uses of 'queer'**

**Steer clear of queer as an archaic synonym for odd or strange** (e.g., "queer weather" and "a queer choice"), unless in a clip or transcribed quote. **At the heart of such dated phrasing is the sense of queer as abnormal** — which is clearly different from, say, other comparatively quaint fossils, such as "gay" to mean festive, colourful or fun (as in "Don we now our gay apparel" from the 19th century Christmas carol, _Deck the Halls_).

**Prefer specific over generic when facts fit**

It's **a good idea to lean toward specific language** whenever practical (e.g., **anti-trans** instead of anti-2SLGBTQ+, and a **homophobic slur** instead of an 2SLGBTQ+ slur), **as long as the narrower focus is accurate.** Otherwise, stick with generic wording (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ activists, and discrimination against the 2SLGBTQ+ community).

**Be aware that some individuals tell us that they feel their identities are being erased by what they perceive as overuse of the abbreviation 2SLGBTQ+.** For example, if doctors say **gay men** appear to be more at risk of contracting a virus, we should say so. And if authorities warn that **trans youth** are more likely to take their own lives than other teens, we should report this detail clearly.

**Language that may not be familiar to most of our audience** (asexual, pansexual, polysexual) **should generally be defined when used, with the relevance clearly supplied** (e.g., "Jones considers herself 'polysexual,' saying the word bisexual is too limiting because it implies there are only two genders"). **But do not use wording that's either dated or inaccurate** (e.g., referring to an intersex person as a hermaphrodite).

**Guard against misusing or mischaracterizing terms that you're not familiar with.** For instance, in 2SLGBTQIA+, the A conventionally means asexual. And **while it's accurate to say that asexual people aren't sexually attracted to others, it's overly simplistic to suggest they don't experience other forms of attraction** in certain cases (e.g., romantic or aesthetic). It's also wrong to assume that asexuality is always static as individuals age, or to use "asexual" as a synonym for "celibate."

**Miscellaneous**

**Avoid words such as "admit"** (e.g., "admits being gay"), which suggest an element of wrongdoing. **Reserve expressions such as openly gay or openly lesbian** to rare cases when this detail is essential to keep stories clear or accurate (e.g., when referring to expansion of 2SLGBTQ+ rights in a more tolerant society, or when qualifying a historic election victory by acknowledging that past mayors, premiers, etc., may have been closeted gay men or gay women).

**Be on the lookout for non-standard use of common 2SLGBTQ+ language, attributing any potentially contentious wording as needed.** In June 2023, for example, Johns Hopkins University came under fire for publishing a glossary that defined **"lesbian"** as **"a non-man attracted to non-men."** Critics called the decision to bypass references to women misogynistic. The document was taken off-line, and the school's Office of Diversity and Inclusion said there would be more rigorous editorial oversight of material posted in the future.

**When referring to a same-sex relationship or marriage, follow the individual's preference:** boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, partner, etc. If a preference is unknown, the story's facts are our best guide (e.g., when there's no marriage, a generic word such as "partner" is better than "spouse," which normally implies marriage).

The term homosexual is considered judgmental and offensive by some, since we rarely talk about a "heterosexual" in the same way. **Limit use of the word homosexual to clinical contexts and direct quotations.** Use gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc., instead. By contrast, **the nouns homosexuality, heterosexuality and bisexuality are all fine** in overall discussions about sexuality. The colloquial term **straight** is acceptable as a synonym for heterosexual.

Expressions such as **gay men and women**, **gay people** and the **gay community** are all OK when specifically focused on identities tied to sexual orientation. The description **"gay and bisexual men**" is generally better than "men who have sex with men," because the former neutrally refers to sexual orientation while the latter stresses sexual behaviour. The same applies to "**lesbians and bisexual women**."

**Certain redundancies are deep-rooted and perfectly acceptable** (e.g., the LG in 2SLGBTQ+ refers to "lesbian" and "gay," respectively, even though lesbians are, by definition, gay). English is not always literal or logical, and sometimes a missing word (i.e., gay "man") is both implied and instantly understood. **But avoid needlessly superfluous phrasing**, such as "lesbian woman" (which is repetitive) versus "lesbian firefighter" (which is OK because each element of the compound is distinct).

To bolster inclusiveness, many proper nouns have been formally renamed (e.g., **Pride Month** celebrations, **Pride Week** festivals, and Toronto's **Pride parade**, rather than "Gay Pride Week" festivals and "Gay Pride parade"). It's important, therefore, to verify the official names of organizations and events.

Keep pride lowercase in generic uses only (e.g., "Embrace queer pride," she said). Otherwise, **use uppercase Pride when referring to community events or cultural symbols** (e.g., a **Pride flag**). See [holidays and special times](/home/h/holidays) for related, in-house capitalization guidelines (e.g., time periods, such as Day and Week and Month are uppercase, but generic words such as breakfast, parade, party and fireworks are normally lowercase, as in Labour Day parade). An exception is **Dyke March**, which is historically treated as a compound proper noun.

**2SLGBTQ+ slurs**
**Follow [CBC Journalistic Standards and Practices policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Flanguage-langue-1.4523261&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw00j0MyNt5WClLhwDOEulcB) when handling offensive language**. If you have any doubts, talk to your supervisor.

**Homophobic, anti-trans and related slurs do not automatically need to be censored in stories** (i.e., bleeped on air or masked with hyphens online). **But they must never be gratuitous, and audience warnings should be included.
**



> EXAMPLES: When covering an anti-2SLGBTQ+ protest, there's no hard rule about blurring images of repugnant signs like "God Hates Homos" or "God Hates Fags," or bleeping equally offensive chants in a radio story. The same applies to a controversy over song lyrics, past comments by someone running for political office, and a debate over certain words on TV, including Canadian comedian Scott Thompson's fervent opposition to censoring "faggot." Editorial teams must determine the most appropriate way to handle such language based on our JSP principles, as well as on a given story's facts, assumptions about audience taste levels, etc.


**When making decisions about what to include in stories, it may be helpful to consider the following:**

-   **Paraphrases and general descriptions are sometimes sufficient** to convey key information (e.g., an athlete is accused of using a "homophobic slur"). See also prefer specific over generic above (e.g., anti-trans versus anti-2SLGBTQ+).

-   **If you include [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language), exercise restraint.** There's no need to keep repeating the word or words. For example, it's generally sufficient to report that "faggot" appeared more than a dozen times in two emails, or in several tweets, without bombarding our audience with verbatim citations.

-   Words such as **fag, faggot, homo, dyke, etc., are hateful and hurtful in almost all contexts**, despite various efforts by 2SLGBTQ+ activists to defang the terms though linguistic appropriation. Put another way: Even though "faggot" is commonly used either neutrally or affectionately by some gay people, **audience warnings are required for homophobic slurs.** Entrenched proper nouns devoid of malevolence do NOT require special care (e.g., the comic strip **_Dykes to Watch Out For_** or a **Dyke March** at a Pride festival), but such usage remains relatively rare.

-   **Masking all pejorative usage can result in odd, inconsistent treatment of certain words** (e.g., censoring "Death to Dykes" graffiti in a story about rising anti-2SLGBTQ+ hate in the weeks leading up to a city's annual "Dyke March," or censoring "queer" in one context but not in another).

-   **Leaving homophobic slurs intact on air and online does not, in itself, mean we think the language is inoffensive**. Rather, it's often a matter of deciding whether the language is so out-of-bounds that it must be either axed or sanitized.

-   **Linguists point out that certain words tend to be more shocking than others based in part on "taboo" status** tied to infrequent public use. **We sometimes get complaints from people who think homophobic slurs should almost always be expurgated, along the lines of c--t and n----r. But judging degrees of offence can be highly subjective**. Scholars who study derogatory language say the use of "faggot," "dyke," "queer" and so forth by 2SLGBTQ+ activists has influenced society's overall reaction to these words over the past few decades. **For a detailed comparison of "c--t" versus "faggot" in our journalism, see this [November 2019 reply to an CBC ombudsperon complaint](/media/14pfs2m3/cbcnews_handling-offensive-terms-like-faggot_reply-to-ombud-complaint_nov-2019.pdf)** — which underscores the need to warn audiences when stories include homophobic slurs.



**Historical background** (From LG to 2SLGBTQ+ and beyond)

Nearly 800 years ago, "gay" meant "bright" and "lively" in English, a definition that held fast for more than half a millennium. During the 19th century, "gay" became a nickname for female prostitutes, and by the 1920s, it had morphed into a disdainful label for homosexual men and women. With the rise of the gay rights movement in the 1960s, however, the word was embraced as a symbol of pride rather than as a mark of derision.

The **first known use of the term LGB is from 1985**. There's anecdotal evidence that this was **expanded to include the letter "T" in the late 1980s**, although the earliest recorded written record of **LGBT** and **GLBT** is from **1992**, according to lexicographers at the Oxford English Dictionary. The B stood for "bisexual," and the T represented either "transgender" or "transgendered," depending on the writer. Both abbreviations appeared in early internet forums known as Usenet server newsgroups. The initial posts urged bisexual people to take on louder, more visible roles within what was described as society's non-straight population.

Within a few years, **LGBT became the default name** of the "lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender" community, **although the abbreviation remained uncommon in mainstream news coverage until roughly 2010**. By the mid-2010s, additional letters started appearing. There was no consensus on the best order, however, and certain letters were repeated in an effort to convey different meanings (e.g., T for transgender and T for transexual, Q for queer and Q for questioning, A for asexual and A for allies). A typical cluster in blog posts and emails during this period was: "**LGBTTQQI2SAAP**."

At roughly the same time, a few symbols started surfacing. For instance, some suggested putting an ampersand before the T to distinguish gender identity from sexual orientation (i.e., **LGB&T**). While the & never took hold, a + symbol gained popularity (**LGBTQ+**) because it acknowledged numerous unnamed subcommunities without extending an already long abbreviation with a single syllable: Plus.

In Canada, **"two-spirit" didn't start routinely appearing in the abbreviation in mainstream news coverage until about 2017**, initially as the number 2 (i.e., **LGBTQ2**) before expanding to 2S. While LGBTQ2S+ is used by some people now, the abbreviation has frequently appeared as **2SLGBTQ+** since 2022.



**EXAMPLES OF PROPER NOUNS IN MOTION:** In 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a proclamation affirming June as "**Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+) Pride Month**" ― a decade after U.S. President Barack Obama had first declared June "**Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month**," and 20 years after Bill Clinton had designated it "**Lesbian and Gay Pride Month**." Meanwhile, the U.S.-based **National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association** (NLGJA), founded in 1991, officially changed its name to the **Association of LGBT Journalists** in 2013, to the **Association of LGBTQ Journalists** in 2016, and then to the **Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists** in February of 2023.



**2SLGBTQ+ GLOSSARY**

**agender** — A person who doesn't identify with a specific gender (e.g., woman or man). Sometimes considered distinct from [non-binary](#glossary-non-binary), which usually implies a blend of, or a fluidity between, traditional binary labels.

**asexual** — Someone who is not sexually attracted to others, although they may still experience other forms of attraction, such as romantic or aesthetic.

**biological** — Generally limit to medical or scientific contexts (e.g., biological research, biological instincts, biological weapons, a person's biological mother). In stories about the transgender community, avoid use of the modifier to classify individuals (e.g., do not talk about a "biological man" or "a biological female") unless attributed. See the [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-at-birth "Transgender") for details.

**bisexual** — Someone attracted to men and women. While the clipped form bi can be OK in second reference, depending on a story's overall tone, it can be perceived as a breezy colloquialism that's sometimes better suited to attribution.

**cisgender** — Someone who is **not transgender**. OK as long as the meaning is clear. While it can be a highly succinct way to cover certain stories (e.g., medical findings involving transgender and cisgender patients), not everyone is familiar with the word, and not all cisgender want to be referred to this way. See transgender overview for more details on [cisgender usage](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#cisgender "Transgender").

**cross-dresser** — Someone who wears clothing traditionally associated with a different gender. **Do not use the outdated term "transvestite."** Cross-dressing is unrelated to sexual orientation, and might not be tied to any erotic fetish. Generic use of the term cross-dresser is fine, but avoid applying to specific individuals unless they use the term themselves. Guard against inaccuracy when referring to gender expression. In particular, while cisgender people may cross-dress, transgender people simply dress. (Compare with [drag performer](#glossary-drag-performer) below.)

**deadnaming** — Calling a transgender person by their former name (usually their birth name). Be aware that not all transgender people consider their old identities completely "dead" for various reasons. **CBC News style is to use a transgender person's current name in virtually all cases.** Exceptions are rare, and, even then, the former name should be used only once for a clear editorial reason. (See [former names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#former-names "Transgender") in the transgender overview for details.)

**drag performer** — An entertainer who dresses and acts like someone of a different gender. Specific usage is common and OK (e.g., a **female impersonator** is a **drag queen**, and a **male impersonator** is a **drag king**). Drag performers sometimes rely on elaborate costumes and exaggerated comportment during shows. While it's accurate to refer to them as **cross-dressing entertainers**, do not use the term drag performer as a simple synonym for cross-dresser.

**female, male** — Primarily adjectives indicating people's sex. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overivew.)

**gender** — Although gender has several meanings (e.g., masculine and feminine groupings in grammar), the word usually refers to society's classification of people under the historically binary headings of woman or man. This gender classification, in turn, is traditionally tied directly to one's sex at birth (female or male). That's why gender labels are considered cultural while sex labels are considered biological. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overview, as well as [non-binary](#glossary-non-binary) below.)

**gender identity** — A person's subjective sense of their own connection, or lack of connection, to the gender category (woman, man) assigned to them at birth based on their sex (female, male). Since cisgender people report feeling a strong link between their gender and their sex, experts say they can have difficulty understanding the incongruence felt by transgender people. (See [gender dysphoria](#glossary-gender-dysphoria) below.)

**gender dysphoria** — A medical term that refers to a person's inner conflict and deep unhappiness over their assigned gender, including society's perception of who they are. It **has replaced the now-discredited 1980s psychiatric label "gender identity disorder," which should not be used.** The word dysphoria is the opposite of euphoria and underscores the depths of depression that doctors may refer to in a given diagnosis. This is important because it means the medical focus is on the distress someone feels over the incongruence between their gender identity (brain) and their biological sex (body), rather than on now-rejected notions of a psychological disorder. The most common reason for including the term gender dysphoria in a news story is when the diagnosis is required in a given jurisdiction before certain medical care (e.g., hormone therapy or surgery) can be approved. (See [gender-affirming care](#glossary-gender-affirming-care) below.)

**gender-affirming care** — A common and OK term for a range of medical treatments tied to transitioning, from hormone therapy to gender surgery. Alternative expressions such as **gender-confirming care** are also fine, although some wording is now widely considered dated (e.g., gender reassignment) and, so, should be attributed. **Do not use the archaic term "sex change" operation**, which focuses on the body (sex) instead of on the person's gender identity. See [transitioning](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#transition "Transgender") for details.

**intersex** — Someone born with a body that falls outside of traditional, binary sex categorization (genitalia, chromosomes). Being intersex can include a discrepancy between external and internal reproductive organs, or a combination (e.g., both ovarian and testicular tissue). **Do not confuse with non-binary or transgender. Avoid the outdated label hermaphrodite.**

**man, woman** — Primarily nouns indicating gender identity. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overivew.)

**misgendering** — To misstate someone's gender identity, usually by using the wrong pronoun. It can be done intentionally or unintentionally. Since the term, coined in 1989, remains unfamiliar to many in our audience, it's often clearer to describe the act rather than to rely on a one-word label (e.g., misstating a person's gender, referring to someone by the wrong gender, using the wrong pronoun).

**non-binary** — A person who doesn't strictly identify as a woman or a man. Includes those who are gender-fluid (i.e., whose gender identity may fluctuate), but not necessarily those who are [agender](#glossary-agender) (i.e., who say they don't have a gender). While the term is NOT narrowly synonymous with transgender, **some transgender people are non-binary, and use pronouns other than she or he** (e.g., "they/their"). See [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#pronouns "Transgender") for related guidelines.

**queer** — An umbrella term used by many, but not all, members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community to describe themselves. The root term also appears in some words that specify a narrower meaning (e.g., **genderqueer** focuses on gender identity, which has nothing to do with sexual orientation). Be mindful that some people object to being called queer. When referring to specific individuals, respect known preferences. (See '[Queer' requires caution](#queer) above for details.)

**sex** — A biological classification (female, male) usually tied to reproductive organs. Sex is distinct from gender, which is a societal designation historically assigned to individuals based on their binary sex classification at birth. (See [gender vs. sex](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#sex-gender "Transgender") in the transgender overview.)

**sexual orientation** — Refers to the gender or genders of people we're sexually attracted to (e.g., to men, women, both, neither). Include in stories only when relevant. **Avoid the dated and inaccurate term "sexual preference,"** which wrongly implies that one's sexual orientation is a "lifestyle choice." The most common categories are gay (men attracted to men), lesbian (women attracted women), bisexual (attracted to men and women), straight (men attracted to women, women attracted to men), and asexual (not sexually attracted to others).

**transgender** — A person whose identity does not match the gender classification traditionally linked to the sex (female, male) they were assigned at birth. Report this detail only when relevant to a story (e.g., a transgender man, a transgender woman). Go with the name and pronouns the individual uses. Being transgender is unrelated to sexual orientation. The colloquial short form **trans** is often OK in stories, especially in second reference (e.g., a trans lawyer). See the [transgender overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/ "Transgender") for details and related guidelines.

**transexual** — **Avoid outside of direct attribution** (e.g., when citing historical documents, or when people currently describe themselves this way). For many years, the term referred to what we now call transgender individuals undergoing certain medical care (usually hormone therapy as well as surgery). Although the word transsexual was relatively common during the mid-20th century, it's now generally perceived as old-fashioned because it stresses "sex" over "gender" in a way that's at odds with how transitioning is conventionally discussed in the 21st century.

**transvestite** — **Do not use.** (See [cross-dresser](#glossary-cross-dresser) above.)

**two-spirit** — A broad label used by some Indigenous people who describe themselves having both masculine and feminine spirits. It's defined in different ways by various people, and can refer to gender identity as well as sexual orientation. **Do not apply to non-Indigenous people.** (See [2SLGBTQ](#2S) above for details.)


**NOTE:** This glossary covers various words that routinely appear in our journalism, or that have sometimes caused confusion. But it does not include every term used in the 2SLGBTQ+ community. **Be aware that some labels can muddy attempts at precision** — such as **pansexual** (often defined as people attracted to others regardless of their sex or gender), **omnisexual** (sometimes defined as people attracted to others regardless of their sex but for whom gender may be a consideration), and **polysexual** (sometimes defined as people attracted to those of any sexual orientation but not necessarily to any gender identity). Since many in our audience may not be familiar with these terms, and since there's not always consensus over the actual denotative and connotative meanings, **a good practice is to skip such labels and lean toward clear descriptions to avoid ambiguity** (e.g. "Mia says prefers to date lesbians, but is also attracted to some bisexual men").

### Liberal senator

**Liberal senator**

**Continue to prefer the compound "Liberal senator"** for members of Canada's Senate appointed by Liberal prime ministers or who have official ties to the Liberal Party. As with many titles, the term is **capitalized and commonly abbreviated before the person's name** (Liberal Sen.):

> **Liberal Sen.** George Baker is from Newfoundland.
>
> **Liberal** George Baker was appointed to the **Senate** in 2002.
>
> **Ontario Liberal Sen.** Art Eggleton disagreed.
>
> Art Eggleton, a **Libeal-appointed senator,** voted against the legislation.
>
> **Liberal Sen.** Jim Munson was Jean Chretien's director of communications.
>
> Jim Munson has been a **Liberal senator** since 2003.
>
> **Liberal** George Furey was named **Speaker of the Senate** in December 2015.


In January 2014, the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada declared that sitting Liberal senators were no longer members of his parliamentary caucus. They remained members of the Liberal Party, however, and continued to identify themselves as Liberals on the Senate's official website. Including this brief background can sometimes help our audience put certain facts into context, depending on the story. But the detail is optional and not always directly relevant or practical.

For consistency and editorial clarity, CBC News continues to refer to these women and men as Liberal senators (or Liberal-appointed senators). **Even new senators selected through a non-partisan process**, such as an advisory panel, **are still, technically, picked or named by the prime minister of the day. In these cases**, however, it's clearest to **adopt the term used by the new senators themselves** (e.g., if they refer to themselves as a Liberal, Conservative, Independent).

While the compound **Senate Liberal** has surfaced in some quarters, it's **generally a poor choice** because it boils down to conveying the same detail but in a **less conversational** way. We normally use the word "senator" as a noun ("She's a senator") or as an attributive noun ("Conservative Sen. Linda Frum"). Recasting so that a given party's name (Conservative) falls second within a noun string (e.g., Senate Conservative Linda Frum) doesn't actually change the meaning. In other words, **our audience will not instantly distinguish between Liberal Sen. George Baker and Senate Liberal George Baker**, regardless of any technical arguments about specific caucus affiliation. **Furthermore, adopting this style for some senators but not for all senators can lead to distracting, non-parallel constructions within the same story** (e.g., "Senate Liberal George Baker met with Conservative Sen. Linda Frum"). It's akin to reporting on "Conservative MPs" and "House of Commons Liberals."

In our Parliament Hill coverage, we generally **reserve the qualifier "[Independent](/home/i#Independent)" for senators and MPs who are no longer members of a given political party** (i.e., people who have formally severed ties with a party, either because they left on their own or because they were kicked out).

### Library

**Library versus library**


The word **library is normally lowercase:**

the Ottawa library
the University of Calgary library
Toronto’s library has about 100 branches

**Use a capital “L” only in proper names:**

Ottawa Public Library
National Library of Canada, also called the National Library
Toronto Reference Library
Toronto Public Library
Library of Parliament (also called the Parliamentary Library)
Library of Congress (U.S.)

### light-year

**Light-year**

A light-year is **a measure of distance, not time**.

It refers to how far light can travel in the vacuum of space while the Earth makes one full orbit around the sun. The term is also used in a figurative sense to imply a big gap. (“They were light-years apart.”)

**Do _not_ write that it takes 10 light-years to travel from X to Y. Rather, say that X and Y are 10 light-years apart.**

You can also avoid the term “light-year” altogether by describing the distance (e.g., “It takes light 10 years to travel from X to Y.”) **The definition of a “terrestrial year”** (12 months on Earth rather than, say, 142 months on Jupiter) **is implied.**

**One light-year is about 9.5 million million kilometres.** (Light is estimated to travel at close to 300,000 kilometres a second. It takes about eight minutes to get from the sun to Earth, which is roughly 150 million kilometres away.)

**Astrophysicists often use other units when estimating distances in space.** A parsec, for instance, is about 3.26 light-years. **Avoid these terms** (parsec, kiloparsec, megaparsec, etc.) **even in science stories, unless you include a clear and accurate definition.**

### like versus as

**Like versus as**

For years, most language authorities have objected to the use of "like" as a subordinating conjunction — a fancy name for a word or phrase that connects a sentence's main idea to a dependent clause. (The dependent clause is considered subordinate because it cannot meaningfully stand on its own.) For example: In the sentence "We should wait an hour as we promised," the subordinating conjunction "as" connects the dependent clause "as we promised" to the main part of the sentence. Replacing "as" with "like" is considered ungrammatical by many (i.e., "We should wait an hour like we promised").

It's generally OK to use "like" as a preposition (e.g., before a noun, pronoun or noun phrase, such as "Please try to write like me"). But **you risk sharp criticism when putting "like" in front of clauses containing verbs** (e.g., "Please try to write as I do," _not_ "Please try to write like I do").

This is a relatively minor matter, and the 1998 New Fowler's Guide to Modern English Usage points out that a lot of good writers ignore the complaints. Its editors predict that opposition to this use of "like" will eventually fade entirely. But we haven't reached that point yet, and the **CBC's preference is to avoid "like" as a conjunction as long as the writing is still conversational.**

**What does this mean in practical terms? If you put a verb after "like," it's generally better to rewrite the sentence** (e.g., "He swims as if his life depended on it" _not_ "He swims like his life depended on it.") **When there's no verb, "like" is OK** (e.g., "He swims like an Olympic champ.") In such cases, the word "like" is commonly setting up a direct comparison (e.g., one person's swimming versus an Olympic champion's).

### like versus such as

**Like versus such as**

**The word "_like_" can be used to introduce a specific example in a sentence** (e.g., _"Jazz standards, like Sophisticated Lady and Take the A Train ..."_). There is nothing ungrammatical about the construction. **It's often the most natural way to word an illustration.**

**Some insist on 'such as'**
More than a few writers and editors insist on always using _"such as"_ for specific examples (_"Jazz standards, such as Sophisticated Lady and Take the A Train ..."_). They reserve _"like"_ for mere resemblance (_"Duke Ellington, like many other fine jazz pianists, knew how to be a soloist at centre stage and an accompanist behind the scenes"_).

They argue that using _"like"_ for named illustrations is illogical because the word implies that the examples are not actually included (e.g., songs _"like"_ A and B but _not_ songs A and B _themselves_).

**
'Like' preferred by others**
Many people disagree with this interpretation, however, and the "rule" that specific examples always be introduced by "such as" is hotly disputed.

The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage points out that a lot of writers reject the stand against "like" in these cases as "niggling." Many language commentators have sided with them. "Since language commentators can so rarely resist a nice distinction, their balking at this one bears close attention," the book adds.

In some idiomatic expressions, "like" is actually the preferred choice: "We're lucky to have a teacher like you." In other cases, **the use of "such as" or "like" is entirely up to the writer.**

## Overview

**Links are part of the DNA of online news.** Even if we don't add a single link to a story, the story itself is a link somewhere on the internet.

**Virtually all articles are improved by internal and/or external links.** They give our audience instant access to various layers of relevant information. They add depth without making the original story overly long. They interconnect images, audio and text in unique and valuable ways. They turn the stationary concept of a web "address," which implies destination, into the animated idea of a web "pathway," which suggests travel. In brief: **Links in stories let people journey across the web, and journey is at the heart of good web journalism.**

**But links have their limitations.** Off-topic background adds no value, for instance, and too many inline links in a piece can be overly distracting. Also, poorly worded hypertext can confuse people.

**These guidelines are intended to answer common editorial questions about publishing links on CBCNews.ca.** They comply with the corporation's comparatively broader [Journalistic Standards and Practices policies on links](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fproduction-digital-media-1.4523443&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0M6KmktDy0CxkQtW9MR8gF).

## Serving our audience

Why bother adding links? Isn't it better to try to hold on to web audiences while you've got them? Grazing or digging, people on the web are on the move. **To captivate an audience, we need to publish engaging material. To help serve our audience, however, we also need to post relevant links.** Trying to box in readers by limiting the number of exits is futile. It's also frustrating for online news audiences who expect options while surfing.

Taking the time to find and add good links to web stories, therefore, is important. Some readers may leave sooner than hoped. They're in the driver's seat, after all. But online roads are not one-way, and smartly chosen links actually build traffic over time. People will return to us as an authoritative and comprehensive source of information if we're offering relevant, clearly marked paths to explore.

## INTERNAL

**Internal links direct people to content published and controlled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation** (i.e., on CBC.ca or Radio-Canada.ca). These include related stories (past or current), backgrounders, interactives, galleries, databases, analyses and various user-generated contributions. Actual authorship may not be a factor. For instance, a public study into the collapse of a bank would be an external link if posted on, say, a government website, but original government documents into the bank's collapse obtained, scanned and published by CBCNews.ca would be internal.

**Internal links should be:**

-   **On point in a meaningful way.** Avoid cramming a page with links to material that is not sensibly tied to an overall narrative. For example, in a budget story about a plan to increase tobacco taxes, there is very little point linking to a general CBC feature on medical research into the harmful effects of smoking. On the other hand, a link to good background on previous government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption through advertising restrictions, higher taxes, etc., would likely be worthwhile.
-   **As specific as possible.** This is also known as "deep linking." When faced with the option of sending audiences to, say, a general feature on the Olympics versus a piece on controversies in figure-skating judging at past Games, pick the more specific link as long as it's directly tied to the current article. This saves readers from the chore of hunting for the most-relevant material on a page of broad content.
-   **Limited to the most valuable of what's available.** We may have already published a dozen stories about a certain high-profile murder trial. A link to a timeline of coverage, with each headline listed in chronological order, would be helpful to our audience. A separate link to a recent story about certain related testimony might also be worthwhile. But there's no point indiscriminately adding too many internal links. People can run their own keyword searches if they want to scan everything.
-   **Out of date only if flagged as a snapshot in time.** Previous stories can be worth looking at even though they contain only the information that was known back then (e.g., the wrong number of dead in the initial coverage of a plane crash). But all in-depth features we promote should be as current as possible (e.g., the correct number of dead, the confirmed cause of the plane crash). Avoid linking to CBC features, profiles, etc., that are significantly out of date. And always alert the in-depth team if you spot something that's wrong or dated.
-   **Legally and journalistically sound.** Past CBCNews.ca coverage may include information that, while accurate, we may no longer want to flag through links for legal or editorial reasons. Details could violate a publication ban that has since been imposed, for example, or an old piece may include especially gruesome photos that no longer merit being highlighted months after the story broke. See [legal issues](/home/l/links/home/l/links/home/l/links#legal_issues) below for more cautionary tips.
-   **Clearly identified to help people make informed judgments about whether to click.** Brief text (e.g., a news headline or other meaningful capsule) covering the gist of the content is essential. Unless the link is to a past CBCNews.ca article (generally implied by the headline), indicate the format whenever possible (e.g., whether it's an in-depth feature, a broadcast report, a photo gallery, a PDF). Avoid unnecessary phrases, such as "Click here."

**Examples of acceptable internal link hypertext in page margins:**

_(Note: On CBCNews.ca, such links are normally indicated by different colour text. They're underlined in these guidelines, however, for ease of illustration.)_

Any tips on dealing with growing garbage piles?

Remember that online slugs are visible in people's browsers after they click on content. So it's important to choose words carefully (e.g., slugs that are brief, meaningful, accurate, neutral) and to spell words accurately in filenames as well as in hypertext (i.e., in the actual links' labels).

**Use internal links to:**

-   **Add depth while keeping the narrative flowing.** Instead of piling on a lot of background in the middle of a story (from scientific details about the swine flu virus to the history of the latest Mideast peace proposal), provide a brief summary and then let the link fill in the rest for people who want more information. But never assume people already know important background, and do not rely solely on links for content that's central to the audience's understanding of a story. In other words, always add a condensed version of essential material in the main body of the story even if it's covered much more thoroughly via a link.
-   **Layer information effectively.** Instead of adding another series of paragraphs under a subhead in the main story, consider writing a related sidebar and then linking to it (as long as there's enough good material for a separate piece). This not only prevents stories from becoming overly long, it helps our audience find key content quickly via clear signposts and logical navigation.
-   **Create unique web content.** When practical and effective, use links to craft journalism that goes beyond standard, linear storytelling. Audio, video, photos and text can be interconnected in ways that are distinct online. Interactive graphics and narrated slide shows are examples.
-   **Promote related CBC material and user-generated content that adds value to our coverage**, such as a broadcast program's profile of someone in the news, a columnist's stand on a particular controversy or people's contributions to an online survey or contest.

Internal links do not need to open in new browser windows, and can be included either along the margin of a page or within the main body of the story itself (as an inline link). Always check the published version to make certain that the internal link you've added works. One wrong or missing character can cause problems.

## EXTERNAL

**External links direct people to content not published and controlled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation** (i.e., to content beyond CBC.ca and Radio-Canada.ca). These include websites run by governments, businesses, universities, charities, etc., as well as online space belonging to individuals, such as personal blogs. Actual authorship may not be a factor. For example, a ruling on the Supreme Court of Canada's site would be external, while a PDF of the same document created by and posted on CBCNews.ca would technically be an internal link to third-party content.

**External links should be:**

-   **On point in a meaningful way**, as outlined in internal links above. In a piece on political unrest in Iran, it makes sense to add links to the current government's (president's) website as well as those of the main opposition parties, as long as these are all available in English. But posting an external link to, say, the UN's website when the United Nations is mentioned only peripherally in the story adds nothing to our journalism.
-   **As specific as possible.** This is also known as "deep linking," as outlined in internal links above. For instance, in coverage of hamburger tainted with E. coli, we should link to the specific government web page dealing with the recall (www.inspection.gc.ca/recarapp/2009/20090630-2e.shtml) rather than to a generic web address, such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's main page (www.inspection.gc.ca). This saves our audience time.
-   **Limited to the most valuable of what's available**, as outlined in internal links above. In a story about international currency fluctuations, for instance, it may make sense to add links to a few key central banks' websites. But adding links to dozens of countries' central bank sites would be overkill.
-   **Legally and journalistically sound.** Always exercise care when linking to external content, especially if it's not a known and "trusted" site (e.g., material posted by a government department or by an established company generally requires less scrutiny than something published by a fringe group or private citizen). Watch out for anything that might offend a lot of readers or cause other concerns (e.g., content advocating hatred and violence, featuring pornography, promoting commercial products). See [legal issues](/home/l/links/home/l/links/home/l/links#legal_issues) below for more cautionary tips.
-   **Clearly identified**, as outlined in internal links above, so people can make an informed judgment about whether to click. Brief text covering the gist of the content is essential, including information about the source of the material (e.g., the author or where it's located on the internet). Unless the link is to another page of web text, indicate the format (e.g., audio, video, PDF). Avoid unnecessary phrases, such as "Click here," and obvious detail, such as "website."

**Some examples of acceptable external link hypertext in a page's margin:**

_(Note: On CBCNews.ca, such links are normally indicated by different colour text. They're underlined in these guidelines, however, for ease of illustration.)_

Supreme Court of Canada decision
(Link takes audience directly to ruling. No need to add names of parties, since the story makes this clear. No need to add technical details, such as docket number. No need to specify PDF or other format if the decision appears as a standard HTML page.)

The Oliphant inquiry into the Mulroney-Schreiber affair
(No need to use commission's long, formal name. When shortening, look for a widely used nickname or an acceptable description that emphasizes meaningful keywords.)

List of recalled products: CFIA (PDF)
(Canadian Food Inspection Agency does not need to be spelled out in external link as long as it's used in the story.)

NASA's shuttle landing blog
(Example of "deep linking." A specific spot on the NASA site has been chosen rather than simply the agency's main "nasa.gov" page.)

YouTube: 'Senators behaving badly' video, Part 1 (Runs 6:47)
(If using an external site's title for specific content, such as video, add single quotation marks unless the words are neutral. In this case, the phrase "Senators behaving badly" editorializes, along the lines of "behaving stupidly." An adverb such as "raucously," by contrast, would be more objectively descriptive. Exercise judgment.)

**Use external links to:**

-   **Add depth that's unique to online journalism.** Our story quotes the judge, cites the scientific report, outlines highlights of the federal budget, etc. But when the original material is also available on the web (and it often is), we should also add a link that gives people easy access to the complete ruling, the entire study or all of the budget documents.
-   **Provide balance.** If there are two or more sides to a story, these views should be reflected in external links whenever possible (i.e., if all sides actually have pertinent content online). If a provincial political party elects a new leader, for instance, there's no need to include an external link to every other provincial party. In the middle of an election campaign, on the other hand, a story about a particular party's latest platform promise should include links to all parties running candidates in the election. And in coverage of a demonstration for or against legalized abortions, both stands should be represented by external links.
-   **Increase diversity.** Beyond bolstering balance and fairness, links can add new voices to coverage that might not otherwise have been heard before. In the same way that we should avoid always interviewing the same players (organizations, people) in stories, or picking the same individuals for columns and other commentary, we should go beyond the usual suspects for external links. It doesn't matter if someone has a low profile or lives in a remote area. Insightful researchers, pundits, bloggers, etc., can provide a refreshingly different take on things.
-   **Offer variety.** Beyond the sheer quantity (depth) of material that can be added through external links, there's also remarkably vast versatility. Stories can be enhanced by far more than just pages of text — from a webcam above a busy border crossing to interactive graphics, a photo gallery to entries in a music contest, a statistical database to compelling audio from an interview. Always look for ways to add editorial value to CBCNews.ca coverage with relevant links that inform, entertain, etc., in a range of ways.

External links should open in new browser windows. A disclaimer is generally included that makes it clear the CBC is not responsible for the content. Except in rare cases approved by senior online journalists, external links should not be embedded as "inline text" in the main body of the story itself. Always check the published version to make certain that the external link you've added works. One wrong or missing character can cause problems.

## INLINE

**Inline links are embedded directly in the main body of a story** (i.e., in lines of text). **They are usually** **highlighted words** (e.g., bold, underlined, a different colour) **within paragraphs**, but can also be put in graphics, photo captions, etc. CBCNews.ca began expanding the use of inline links in 2010 to better serve audience needs and expectations.

**Generally prefer inline links** when faced with the choice of placing hypertext to core CBCNews.ca content (e.g., an updated profile) in a story's margin or main narrative.

**Many of the rudimentary legal and editorial guidelines for "side links"** (i.e., links along page margins or otherwise outside the story's main narrative) **outlined above also apply** to inline links. Given their prominent placement in narratives, **however, inline links introduce additional considerations**, addressed below.

## Inline link parameters
 

-   **Normally use inline hypertext to link to internal (CBC) content only**, such as previous news stories, current, related news stories, background features, timelines, photo galleries, glossaries of terms, etc.
-   **External inline links can be added to some journalistic content that does not involve routine reporting**, especially when the point of the piece is to compare external postings or to offer a roundup of external postings, and when the material does not normally feature external links along page margins. **Examples are: columns and analysis, blogs, arts reviews. When uncertain whether external inline links are permitted, check with your supervisor.** No matter where these links are placed (i.e., inline or in page margins) the general [guidelines governing external links](/home/l/links/home/l/links#external) above still apply — including the need for a disclaimer making it clear that the CBC is not responsible for the external content showcased through inline links. If the publishing tool you're using does not automatically generate this warning (e.g., when posting a blog), a pre-approved disclaimer should be manually entered.
-   **Avoid repeating identical inline links on a page**, including in the margin, unless the duplication is unavoidable (i.e., a key inline link is also automatically displayed along the side of the page as part of a package of links out of a writer or editor's control).
-   **Generally steer clear of inline links in leads.** Instead, pick the story's first reference to a person, place or thing after the lead as the text for a given inline link, unless there's a strong editorial reason to select a different spot. If a proper noun's first reference is in the lead (United Nations, Michael Jackson), and only abridged forms appear in subsequent references after that (UN, Jackson), the shortened version is normally fine for hypertext (e.g., "previous UN resolutions"). Since inline links are not generally used for external content, this example would direct readers to relevant CBCNews.ca content about past UN resolutions. Note: When a clipped form of a noun is used for hypertext, always make sure it suits the content on the other end of the link. (In an inline link to a background feature on Michael Jackson, for instance, the hypertext "Jackson died in June" is OK but "The Jackson family has requested privacy" is not because the surname is part of a compound noun that refers to the dead singer's relatives rather than to the pop star himself).
-   **Limit the number of inline links published**, to avoid hypertext from becoming too distracting. While there may be exceptions, the rule of thumb is:

**Per sentence: 2** (maximum)
**Per paragraph: 3** (maximum)
**Per routine story** (under 500 words): **4** (maximum)
**Per routine feature** (800 to 1,000 words): **8** (maximum)

Some stories may have no inline links. Others may scream out for more than the recommended maximum, depending on what relevant content is available, and whether it enhances our online storytelling when highlighted as hypertext.

-   **Always restrict the choice of inline links to content directly relevant to the narrative**, as outlined in "on point in a meaningful way" in the [internal links](/home/l/links/home/l/links/home/l/links#internal) section above. Resist the temptation to post too many inline links, such as the Wikipedia practice of adding hypertext to virtually every noun that someone has written about at some point in some way (e.g., the month of July or the year 1969).

When **Neil Armstrong** stepped off a **ladder** and into history on **July** 20, **1969**, the images of the **first moon walk** riveted hundreds of millions of **TV** viewers around the world. But it appears the moment wasn't historic enough for **NASA** to keep the original **videotape**.

The above illustrates a poor choice of inline links. Many are vague or off-topic. The story is not about the definition of ladder, the etymology of the word July, other events that happened in 1969, the history of TV, an overview of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the invention of videotape. There are also an unnecessarily large number of links clustered in a single paragraph.

When **Neil Armstrong** stepped off a ladder and into history on July 20, 1969, the images of the **first moon walk** riveted hundreds of millions of TV viewers around the world. But it appears the moment wasn't historic enough for NASA to keep the original videotape.

In the revised version, the inline links are directly tied to the narrative. The first is to a CBCNews.ca profile of the mysteriously reclusive Neil Armstrong and the second to a feature on the Apollo 11 mission.

-   **Prefer specific ("deep") inline links over generic ones**, as outlined in the [internal links](/home/l/links/home/l/links/home/l/links#internal) section above. This does not automatically meaning picking a single, tightly focused story over a broader background feature if that feature offers richer content that's still on topic. It simply means serving our audience by getting them to relevant material quickly, without forcing them to be miners.

The investigation into Jackson's death is widening as more questions are asked about whether **prescription drugs** use may have contributed to his cardiac arrest.

To be effective, the above hypertext should link directly to content about Michael Jackson's reported use of painkillers, powerful anesthetics, etc., rather than to general background on prescription drugs (with no mention of Jackson) or a general feature on the singer (with only peripheral mention of drugs).

-   **Use brief and meaningful text for each inline link** (generally one to three words), avoiding space-wasting directives such as "click here." People's names and other proper nouns are effective as keywords (Mark Carney, Bank of Canada) for material focused on them, such as profiles and timelines. More general words can be good hypertext, too, if the terms are in the news (e.g., credit crisis, Ponzi scheme) or succinctly sum up the content on the other end of the link (latest economic update).

In Canada, Friesen's Corp. of Altona, Man., was chosen to print 300,000 copies of the latest **Harry Potter** book, mainly because of its central location. Shipments can be easily sent across the country from the Prairies. But the company also has a proven record for handling **top-secret publishing** projects.

The first inline link is to a feature on the Harry Potter series, while the second is to a CBCNews.ca story about secrecy in Altona, a small town south of Winnipeg, where the fourth book (_Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_) was quietly printed months before the title or cover had been officially revealed anywhere in the world. The archived story points out that Friesen's had been previously entrusted to keep a lid on other printing projects, including a Diana biography and Salman Rushdie's _The Satanic Verses_.

**Ellingsen's testimony** is considered crucial for the Crown because she is the only witness who says she saw Pickton with a dead body. She denies defence claims that she was so high on crack cocaine at the time she mistook an animal's carcass for a woman.

The inline link is to a full story on Ellingsen's recent testimony. Pickton's former friend tells the jury that she walked into the slaughterhouse on the accused's Port Coquitlam pig farm and saw him standing, covered in blood, next to a dead woman who was hanging from a chain.

-   **Make certain the narrative is not hurt by an inline link.** Sentences should remain clear, tight, accurate, etc. Avoid disrupting the natural flow with awkward or out-of-place hypertext. Stories should read equally well for those who can see the highlighted inline link and for those who can't (e.g., people on certain wireless devices).
-   **Keep hypertext sensibly consistent through a story.** This is more helpful to readers than illogical variety.

When Bakhtiar published her first novel, **_Bubbling Gravy_**, she received good reviews but very little money. By the time her fourth book, **_Monkeys in Taxis_**, came out a decade later, she sold one million copies within days and was among the country's highest-paid authors.

In the above example, novel titles are used consistently for hypertext. This is preferred if both links are to background on the specific books.

When Bakhtiar published her first novel, _Bubbling Gravy_, she received **good reviews** but very little money. By the time her fourth book, _Monkeys in Taxis_, came out a decade later, she sold **one million copies** within days and was among the country's highest-paid authors.

In the second version, hypertext other than novel titles is used. This is a signal to readers that both links are to content beyond mere general background about the books. The first, "good reviews," suggests an inline link to a piece on the author's early critical success. The second, "one million copies," suggests an inline link to a story focused on the fourth novel's whopping sales.

### 5 tips to keep hypertext brief
 

**1.** Use acceptable shorthand when the formal name is long.

**Mulroney-Schreiber inquiry**

There's no need to adopt the official title used by Parliament: "The Commission of Inquiry into Certain Allegations Respecting Business and Financial Dealings Between Karlheinz Schreiber and the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney." There's also no need to use a long nickname, such as "The Oliphant inquiry into the Mulroney-Schreiber affair," if it buries important keywords.

**2.** Use a generic noun for the hypertext when the proper noun is long.

The **final book** in the series, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, was published in 2007. It's being turned into two movies, with Part 1 scheduled to be released in November 2010.

This is an example of adding an inline link to content about the final Harry Potter book, without turning the entire italicized title into hypertext.

**3.** Leave titles out of hypertext.

Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice **Beverley McLachlin**

**4.** Highlight only the relevant part of a proper noun

**Charles Schwab & Company**

(An inline link to content about the company.)
 

**Charles Schwab** & Company

(An inline link to content focused on the firm's founder and chairman.)

**5.** Leave possessives out of hypertext unless on-topic.

**Stockwell Day**'s decision to step down as leader ...

(Example of an inline link to a profile of Stockwell Day.)
 

The fight over **Marlon Brando's will** ...

(Example of an inline link to previous coverage of the legal battle over the actor's will.)

### 2 copy editing caveats

Links in the main bodies of stories affect web writing and editing in a more direct way than side links. In particular:

**1\. Typos and other problems can creep in when hypertext is added to already edited and posted content.** If a journalist returns to a live story to add inline links, it's possible that a few paragraphs will need to be recast to accommodate the most sensible hypertext. Special care must be taken to avoid introducing errors during this stage of publishing.

**2\. Inline links can be inadvertently deleted if the hypertext is revised or deleted.** Tracking down lost "HTTP" code and reinserting links takes time that could be better spent on posting new content. All writers and editors must be vigilant when typing in passages that contain inline links.

## LEGAL ISSUES

The following is an abridged version of guidelines in CBC's _Online News Fundamentals_ book. It's intended to provide general direction only. If you have any specific legal questions about a web story you're working on, you should contact your supervisor and/or the CBC Law Department.

#### Internal links

**When writing about criminal investigations and court cases, be cautious with internal links** to previous CBC stories. Past coverage may include information that, while accurate, should no longer be reported or highlighted through links. **In particular, watch out for:**

-   Criminal history or other details that might prejudice a jury trial.
-   Publication bans.
-   Restrictions on naming young people.

The CBC does not generally delete old stories since these are part of the public record. But for legal reasons, we must sometimes avoid linking to them.

**Also, be careful when posting original, scanned documents, user-generated contributions, etc. In particular, watch out for content that violates:**

-   A court order (e.g., information covered by a ban).
-   Copyright.
-   Other laws (e.g., pornography, hate crimes).

Keep in mind that something as seemingly harmless as a reporter's notes scrawled in the margin of a document we've scanned and published could come back to haunt us for legal or editorial reasons.

#### External links

External links may pose other potential legal and editorial problems because the material is not controlled by the CBC. **When deciding whether to link to an external source, ask yourself if there might be anything on the outside site that for legal or editorial reasons could:**

-   Prejudice a jury trial against a defendant.
-   Violate a publication ban.
-   Identify a young person protected by law.
-   Be considered defamatory.
-   Violate copyright.
-   Break other Canadian laws, including those dealing with hate propaganda and child pornography.
-   Offend readers.
-   Be dangerous (e.g. describe how to build a bomb).

**Since checking every nook and cranny of an external website is unrealistic, consider the reliability of the person or organization behind the site as you scan through it**, and always link to a specific page that you've actually viewed. **Also, be prepared to revisit and remove old links if we receive complaints that turn out to be valid.** Remember: Even when an external website seems fine editorially, there's no guarantee it won't be changed. One day you might link to a page that seems benign and the next day discover content that's unacceptable.

## Publishing priorities

**Never hold up breaking news just to insert links.** One of the web's defining features is speed, as urgent stories are built in front of readers' eyes ― from brief bulletins with "More to come" at the bottom to comprehensive packages. All links (external and internal, side or inline) should be added to breaking news at some point in between, along with various other enhancements (e.g., photos, video, audio).

**In the case of other (non-urgent) coverage**, from news stories to lengthy features, **core links should ideally be added when the content is first posted.** As long as the initial publication of routine news is not significantly delayed by the addition of hypertext, the audience is best served when key, relevant links are there from the start (e.g., an electronic version of the court decision a story is based on or a CBCNews.ca in-depth page about the issue underpinning the lawsuit). **Lower priority can be given to more peripheral links** (e.g., a CBCNews.ca column about the ruling or the external websites of groups on both sides of the dispute).

**There's no single formula or chronology to follow. It largely depends on how readily available the links are** (e.g., if URLs are already known or need to be searched for; if a court ruling or government report has already been posted online or won't be ready for a few hours; if internal, scanned documents or PDFs are already on the CBC's main internet server or need to be created and FTP'd).

## Technical (template) reminders

**All links** (internal, external, margin, inline) **must be added to our journalism using appropriate fields within CBC-sanctioned publishing tools or content management systems.** Avoid any attempts to insert raw HTML yourself (e.g., <HREF>). It can cause serious technical problems. It can also be a waste of time, if CBC's automated HTML filters wind up stripping out your manually written code. 

**There's no need to make decisions about typographical design** (e.g., the colour and boldness of text or whether certain links are underlined). **Central style code automatically determines the actual appearance of links on the site.**

If you're unfamiliar with the technical steps involved in adding links, ask a colleague or your supervisor.

See also [URL](/home/u/urls) for how to handle rare cases of web addresses posted as text rather than in the HTML code of live hypertext, including domain names (CBC.ca, CNN.com) treated as proper nouns in news stories.

### Loblaws

**Loblaws**

The corporation’s full name is actually “Loblaw Cos. Ltd.” (singular “Loblaw,” plural “companies”).

But the division generally referred to in news stories is: Loblaws Supermarkets Ltd. (plural Loblaws, no apostrophe).

**So we write:**

Loblaws Supermarkets or **Loblaws** (for the chain of retail outlets)

**a Loblaws store** or **several Loblaws stores** (for more specific references)

### lockdown\_shutdown

**Lockdown, shutdown**

These **nouns often imply complete confinement** (a school lockdown) **or complete stoppage** (a factory shutdown). **But English is sometimes figurative** (e.g., to "break one's heart" means deep sadness rather than cardiac arrest), which makes imposing literal meanings across the board neither practical nor necessary. Conventions and context matter.

It's **OK to use terms such as "lockdown" and "shutdown" in less absolute ways, as long as the intended meaning is clear**. For example, during coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, countries were often referred to as being in various stages of lockdown (citizens urged to stay at home) and shutdown (entire sectors of their economies at a standstill).

In cases like this, **a good practice is to either:**

**1\. Specify what is meant**, since definitions can vary; or

**2\. Qualify words such as lockdown and shutdown at least once, relatively high in a story** (e.g., first few paragraphs, although not necessarily in a web headline or TV banner), **to ensure the intended meaning is conveyed**. For instance, depending on the facts that apply:


> **widespread** shutdown
> **partial** lockdown
> **virtual** shutdown
> **substantial** shutdown


As with a lot of language, **common sense is the key. We must avoid wording that is incontestably inaccurate or misleading** — e.g., claiming that large numbers of Canadians have been "ordered" to stay indoors or have been officially "quarantined" when federal and provincial governments have primarily relied on voluntary recommendations to stay at home as much as possible for an extended period. **At the same time, there's no need to ban instantly understood idiomatic phrasing solely because of narrow, literal interpretations.** For instance, when talking about "an economy slowly reopening" after pandemic emergency measures begin easing, there's no need to fret over the fact that some sectors many never actually have "closed," including food production, grocery sales, automotive repair and telecommunications.


**TYPOGRAPHY** **(FUSE NOUNS NOT VERBS)**


**lockdown** (n.), as in a school _lockdown_, a prison _lockdown_
**lock down** (v.), as in to _lock down_ a neighbourhood, to _lock down_ the country

**shutdown** (n.), as in a factory _shutdown_, a industry _shutdown_
**shut down** (v.), as in to _shut down_ production, to _shut down_ a team's offence


### Londonderry versus London

**Londonderry, also known as Derry**

**To remain as neutral as possible in a political fight over language, CBC News refers to this city in Northern Ireland by both names in first reference whenever possible:**


> _“Three people died in the explosion in Londonderry, also known as Derry.”_


This policy, adopted years ago, was reviewed in 2005 and upheld as the best approach for our journalism (radio, television and online).

CBC.ca headlines can use Londonderry alone, but an "also called Derry" reference must appear high in the story. Londonderry can be used after that.


**Background**
This ancient city was originally called Derry based on the Irish word Doire, which meant "place of oaks." But when it was rebuilt with money from investors in London in the 1600s, it was renamed Londonderry.

Unionists (mainly Protestants in Northern Ireland) still call it Londonderry, which is how it’s been conventionally known in many parts of the world for years. But nationalists (mainly Irish Catholics in the region) never accepted the new name and continue to call the community Derry or Derry City.

Although nationalist politicians have adopted Derry at the municipal level, where Catholics are in the majority, unionists argue that the official name is specified as Londonderry in a Royal Charter.

BBC journalists are told to use Londonderry first, with Derry or Derry City acceptable in subsequent references.

### like versus such as

**Lunar New Year**

**Prefer Lunar New Year in generic references** to the holiday that's known by different names in various East Asian countries (e.g., the Chinese New Year and the Spring Festival in China, Seollal in South Korea and Tet in Vietnam).

It's **OK to use more specific names in stories focused on a particular community** (e.g., the **Chinese New Year** in a report about festivities in China, the **Korean New Year**, the **Vietnamese New Year**).

The festival begins between the end of January and the end of February, depending on moon phases. It's determined by a lunisolar calendar first adopted in China. "Lunisolar" means that a given number of moon phases is eventually lined up with a traditional solar year of 365 days. An ordinary lunisolar year has 353 to 355 days while a lunisolar leap year has between 383 and 385 days.

Be aware that **there's technically more than one "lunar new year."** For example, the Islamic New Year is a completely separate lunar-based holiday that slowly shifts through the entire Gregorian calendar over the centuries. The Islamic calendar is lunar but not "lunisolar," which means there's no attempt to use leap years to "correct" a given number of moon phases in order to match a traditional solar year of 365 days.) **Nevertheless, it's generally unnecessary to specify East Asian** when referring to the Lunar New Year because the entrenched meaning is understood by context. In rare cases when there might be ambiguity, compounds such as **East Asian New Year** or **East Asian Lunar New Year** are fine.

The Chinese horoscope is a key feature of the lunisolar calendar. Each year is assigned one of 12 animals from the Chinese zodiac (e.g., rat, dragon, dog). A few of the animals vary, depending on where the New Year is being celebrated (e.g., a cat instead of a rabbit in Vietnam). Use initial caps in the names (e.g., **Year of the Tiger**, **Year of the Horse**).

See [holidays](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/holidays/ "Holidays") for related capitalization guidelines.

**[mo-my](/home/m#mo)**

**m-md**
**MA** (master of arts), **a master's degree** (See [degrees](/home/d/degrees))

**Macao** (China) Like [Hong Kong](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/hong-kong/ "Hong kong"), Macao can be referred to as either a **city** or a **Special Administrative Region of China**, depending on context. It's located on the country's southern coast. Unless a story makes the meaning clear, it's best to specify whether you mean the dense urban centre on Macao's main peninsula or the larger region. NOTE: The English spelling was revised from "Macau" in 2019 to reflect a shift in common usage inside and outside of China.

**Macdonald-Cartier Freeway** (Highway 401 in Ontario; note small "d" and hyphen)

**Macdonald, Sir John A.** (1815-1891)

**mace** (ceremonial sceptre in the Commons); the mace-bearer is the sergeant-at-arms

**Mace** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for the disabling spray)

**Mach 1, Mach 2.3, Mach 10**, etc. (Use uppercase M, no hyphen and a figure for the number.) Named after Austrian physicist Ernst Mach. Avoid the alternative spelling, Ernest. These numbers are the ratio of speed in any fluid (air, water, etc.) to the speed of sound in that same fluid. The ratio varies, depending on temperature, pressure, etc. In most news stories, a Mach number can be satisfactorily described as an aircraft's velocity expressed as a multiple of the speed of sound. For planes at high altitudes and in extreme cold, Mach 1 is roughly 1,100 km/h (about 680 m.p.h.).

****machiavellian*

*machine-gun, submachine-gun****

**Macintosh** (an Apple computer), but **McIntosh** (an apple)

**mackintosh** (coat)

**Mackenzie, Alexander** (1822-1892)

**Mack Truck** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names))

**Maclean's magazine** (See also [Magazine versus magazine](/home/m/magazine))

**madam** (polite form of address; brothel-keeper)

**madame** (French title of respect. Uppercase "M" before a woman's full name. For example, "Madame Emma Bovary" but "excuse me, madame.")

****[mad cow disease](/home/m/mad-cow-disease)****

**mademoiselle** (no abbreviation)

Madras (Use [**Chennai, India**](/home/c#Chennai))

**maelstrom** (a dangerous or irresistible force)

**Mafia** — It's generally easier to write "members" of the Mafia rather than Mafioso (singular) or Mafiosi (plural).

**Magdalen Islands** (Common and acceptable English name for **Îles-de-la-Madeleine**) While either noun is OK in our journalism, CBC News management in Quebec recommends Magdalen Islands in most cases because it's the most common version used by the province's anglophones. See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents)

**Magna Carta** (_not_ Charta)

**magnetic North Pole** (lowercase "m")

**Magnum** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a cartridge, as in .44-calibre Magnum revolver); magnum (an extra-big wine bottle that can hold about 1.5 litres, or roughly twice the normal amount) See also [weapons](/home/w/weapons)

**MAID** (**[medical assistance in dying](/home/a/assisted_dying)**) The acronym is all uppercase. Avoid variations, such as a lowercase "i." MAID remains too obscure to be used without writing it out in full high up in a story, usually in first reference. See [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms) and [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for related typographical guidelines.

**mailbag, mailbox, mailroom** (one word); **mail slot** (two words)

**mail order** (n.) but **mail-order** (adj.), as in a **mail-order catalogue**

**Maine** (No abbreviation. Do _not_ use Me.) See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

****mainframe, a mainframe computer****

**major** (Maj.) **major-general** (Maj.-Gen.), **major-generals** (See also [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix) as a suffix and [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks))

**make up** (v.), **makeup** (n.)

**malamute** (breed of dog); **Malemute** (type of NASA rocket) A transliteration from the original Inupiaq word (_malimiut_) for a type of Alaskan sled dog. See also [animals](/home/a/animals) and [space](/home/s/space-terms) launch vehicles for relevant capitalization rules.

**mammogram, mammography** (breast X-ray)

**Mamma Mia** (the musical; _not_ Mamma Mia!) See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for applicable punctuation guidelines

**mandarin** (a civil servant; a type of orange); **Mandarin** (the dominant and official spoken language of China) See also [Chinese language](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#Chinese-language "C") for related guidelines.

**mandarin duck** (see [animals](/home/a/animals))

**manhattan** (cocktail)

**man hours** (_avoid_) Use gender-neutral wording, such as **work hours**. Another option is to use a description ("X number of people working Y number of hours") rather than a label (e.g., "They estimate it would take 500 people working around the clock 11 years to finish the project").

**manhunt** (_generally avoid_) Although "manhunt" conventionally refers to anyone being pursued by authorities, "man" in this context is unnecessarily gender-specific. CBC News style is to recast whenever practical. One common rewrite: Shorten the noun "manhunt" to either "hunt" or "search," as in: "_The hunt for two murder suspects_ ..." rather than "_The 'manhunt' for two murder suspects ..._").

****manila paper****

**Manitoba (Man.)** Using the abbreviation in web headlines is optional (See [provinces, territories and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities))

**manoeuvre, manoeuvres, manoeuvrable, manoeuvrability**  

**manpower** (avoid) Use gender-neutral wording, such as **workers** or **workforce** (e.g., "more workers" or "bigger workforce" rather than "increased manpower")

**manslaughter** (see [homicide](/home/h/homicide))

**mantel** (fireplace); **mantle** (cloak)

**Mao Zedong** (_not_ Tse-tung), **Mao** (second reference) See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names)

**Maoism**

**Māori** (Indigenous people in New Zealand) Both singular and plural, as in a **Māori tradition**, the **Māori people**, enshrined rights of **the Māori**. The proper noun is also the name of their eastern Polynesian language (e.g., "translated into **Māori**").

****maple leaf, maple leaves****

**Maple Leaf** (flag and emblem)

**Toronto Maple Leafs, Maple Leaf Gardens** (the team's old building)

**March** (no short form) See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)

**march past** (n. and v.)

**Mardi Gras**

**marijuana** (preferred spelling) **medical marijuana, marijuana growing operation(s), marijuana grow-op(s)**. The **only exception is when referring, verbatim, to a proper noun that uses an "h"** rather than the more-entrenched "j" spelling. In the case of legislation, however, it's often easier to paraphrase (e.g., Canada's medical marijuana regulations). Keep in mind that government department programs are not treated as proper nouns, and do not need to be capitalized or spelled in the same way. For instance, what Health Canada calls its "Medical Marihuana Access Program" can be referred to by us more generically as Health Canada's medical marijuana access program. Furthermore, even if the spelling "marihuana" appears in the text of some legislation, it's OK to stick with the more common "j" spelling in our journalism. **The term cannabis (originally Greek for "hemp") is fine as a synonym**. Although once considered a tad lofty in certain contexts, cannabis has become increasingly common in day-to-day reporting. Keep in mind that even proper nouns can be defined or described in more than one way (e.g., the Cannabis Act tabled in the House of Commons in 2017 "set the stage for the legal production and sale of marijuana in Canada"). Pot, believed to be derived from a Spanish term related to cannabis leaves, "_potiguaya,_" is a common and generally acceptable synonym for cannabis or marijuana. However, **be aware that colloquialisms like "pot," or other similar terms such as “weed,” can affect the tone of stories**. So consider that when choosing which words are best suited to the story. Recreational use of marijuana became legal across Canada on Oct. 17, 2018, although new rules were created to control production, distribution, sale and possession, as outlined in the federal government's [cannabis legalization overview](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/cannabis/). Regulations vary by province. See also [420](/home/f#420), as in 420-friendly, as well as [plants](/home/p/plants) for general capitalization guidelines (e.g., a colloquial name like Purple Haze versus a scientific name like _Cannabis sativa_).


**marines**
a marine offensive, Royal Marines, U.S. Marine Corps, but the marines (an entire service or some of its members), the marine corps, a U.S. marine

**Mark III, Mark 46**, etc. (treat as a proper noun, and follow the maker's style)

**marketplace**

**Markle, Meghan** (U.S. actress engaged to Prince Harry in fall of 2017) Prefer her first name alone in second reference (**Harry and Mehgan**), along the lines of William and Catherine. Meghan is also OK in headlines. (See **[royal titles](/home/r/royal-titles)** for related guidelines)

**marquess** _but_ **Marquis of Queensberry rules**

**Marquis wheat** (see also [grain](/home/g/grain))

**Marrakech** (_not_ Marrakesh) A city in Morocco

**Marseille** (_not_ Marseilles) A city in France

**Mars, Martian** (see [space terms](/home/s/space-terms))

**marshal** (n. and v.), ****marshalled, fire marshal, parade marshal*

*martial law; martial arts*

*martini*

*marvellous****

**Maryland (Md.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**MASH** (Name of 1968 book, 1970 movie and 1972-83 TV series) Do not add hyphens, asterisks, periods or other characters. (See [Names versus logos](/home/n/names-versus-logos) for related guidelines.) While the proper noun MASH stands on its own, the generic abbreviation should be spelled out at least once (**mobile army surgical hospital**) if used at all. A shortened version (**mobile army hospital**) is more common in news stories and usually sufficient because "surgery" is implied.

**mash up** (v.), **mash-up, mash-ups** (noun), as in "a video mash-up on the web"

**mason** (person who builds with stone); **Mason** (member of Masonic order)

**Masonite** (a [trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a brand of hardboard)

****Mason jar*

*mass, low mass, high mass, requiem mass****

**Massachusetts (Mass.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**massacre** (_use with discretion_) A synonym for slaughter. There's no objective definition, such as a minimum body count. Massacre and slaughter both conventionally imply a large number of people murdered in a violent or cruel way, such as the shooting at a high school in Columbine, Colorado in 1999. Deciding whether a story's facts fit this definition requires judgment. In rare cases, the word "massacre" is capitalized when used in the names of historically infamous attacks (e.g., the 1989 **Montreal Massacre**, the 1929 **St. Valentine's Day Massacre**). See also [**mass shooting**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mass-shooting/ "Mass shooting")

**massasauga** (one of only a few rattlesnakes found in Canada) See [animals](/home/a/animals)

****mastectomy****

**Mastercard**

**master bedroom** (AVOID outside of directly transcribed quotes) Coined in the 1920s, the term reflects a patriarchal time when women were still fighting for basic legal rights as "persons" in Canadian law, and the head of a household was almost invariably a man. Master bedroom is **now widely considered sexist and dated.** To some, it also has overtones of slavery. Be aware that many real estate agents, as well as the Canadian Real Estate Association, stopped using the expression in 2020. There are **plenty of alternatives** with no loss of meaning, including **main bedroom, primary bedroom** and **principal bedroom**.

**master of arts** (MA); a **master's degree** (See [degrees](/home/d/degrees))

**master of ceremonies** (Avoid abbreviating if possible. But when transcribing a quote it's **MC** not emcee, M.C., m.c., etc.) Other common terms, to be used only when the context of the sentence makes them immediately clear, are: **MCs, MCing, MCed**

**master sergeant** (Master Sgt.) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**Masters, the** (See [golf terms](/home/g/golf))

**matchup** (n.), **match up** (v.)

**Mecca** (holy place), but lowercase in generic expressions (**a tourist mecca**, etc.)

**medal**, a **military medal** but the **Military Medal**, the **Medal of Bravery**, etc. (specific names); **medallist** (Note: medal is _not_ a verb) See also [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games)

**medevac** (short for "medical evacuation") Avoid the alternative "medi-" spelling, which leaves out a key "e" that represents the second element of the portmanteau. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary lists two spellings of the verb. For consistency, go with the primary version (i.e., **medevacing, medevaced**), which also matches CP style. There is no need for a superfluous "k." (See also [**evacuate**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/e/evacuate/ "Evacuate"))

****Meech Lake, Meech Lake accord****

**megabyte (MB)** No period in short form, which is singular and plural, as in **1 MB, 750 MB**, etc. Since the term has become common, no definition is required in first reference. Note: Technically, there are 1,024 KB in 1 MB. But in general news stories, it's OK to consider 1 MB as roughly 1,000 KB. (See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout) for more guidelines on symbols that look like abbreviations)

**mega-city** (Toronto)

**megapixel** (Always write in full; _avoid_ abbreviations like MP and MGP)

**member of Parliament** (MP), **members of Parliament** (MPs) In national stories, avoid using less-common short forms for provincial politicians (MPP, MHA, MLA, MNA). See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)

****memento, mementoes*

*memo, memos****

**memoir** (_not_ memoire, except in French term aide-mémoire, plural aides-mémoire) See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics#foreignterms) for guidelines on typography surrounding certain foreign words

**memorandum, memorandums** (See also [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals))

**memory stick** (lowercase for generic contexts, such as "a computer memory stick," because the proprietary name is commonly applied to a range of portable memory storage units; but uppercase for specific nouns, such as a Sony Memory Stick XC) See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names) for related guidelines, such as Cellophane becoming cellophane but Band-Aid retaining its initial capital letters.

****meningitis, meningococcal disease*

*Mennonite****

**mentally disabled, mentally impaired** (common and acceptable descriptions, but _prefer specific medical detail_ when known, such as "an IQ below 40" or "the mental capacity of a five-year-old") Keep in mind that there are many different IQ tests, and that intelligence quotients themselves are only one measurement of people's ability to think and learn. _Avoid_ the offensive label "mentally retarded." See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#mentallydisabled) for detailed guidelines.

**mentally ill** (refers to insanity, mental instability, depression, schizophrenia, etc.) See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#mentallyill) for editorial caution

****Mercedes-Benz*

*merchant marine****

**mercy killing** (requires care) See [assisted dying](/home/a/assisted_dying)

**MERS** (Middle East respiratory syndrome) Can be referred to as either the **MERS coronavirus** or as **MERS** in first reference. Spelling out in full at some point in stories is optional but usually unnecessary. The SARS-like condition was first documented in 2012. It was named the **Middle East respiratory syndrome** by the World Health Organization in early 2013. Do not refer to MERS, itself, as a "virus." It's a respiratory illness caused by a virus, in the same way that [AIDS](/home/a/aids) and [SARS](/home/s/sars) are caused by viruses.

**the Messiah, a messiah**

**Meta Platforms Inc.** (formerly called Facebook Inc.) OK to use **Meta** throughout stories. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp changed its name in October 2021. Use lowercase **metaverse**, a sci-fi term coined in the 1990s, when referring to the company's virtual reality 3D project.

**meteor, meteoroid, meteorite** (these words have separate meanings) When meteoroids enter a planet's atmosphere, they become meteors. A lot of meteors falling in a short period are known as **meteor showers**. Meteors that don't burn up entirely and actually hit the planet are called meteorites. See [asteroids, comets and meteors](/home/a/asteroids-meteors) for details.

**meter**
meter (**a gauge**); thermometer, barometer, parking meter, taxi meter, etc. In rare cases, also used as a suffix for a specific type of measurement (diameter, pentameter, etc.)

**metre**
metre (**a metric measurement** equivalent to about 39.4 inches) When shortened, use "**m**" alone with no period, singular or plural (akin to km/h) See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial).

**methadone**

**methodology** (implies an established approach to something) Almost always refers to formal research in the sciences, social sciences, etc. The term usually implies traditional statistical analysis (e.g., representative samplings of populations) that produce results within specified margins of error. It's OK to talk about **methods** used by researchers (e.g., phone surveys). But "methodology" is the preferred term when referring to the overall collection and interpretation of data, including various assumptions found in footnotes (e.g., interest rate projections, economic growth forecasts).

**Métis** Métis broadly refers to descendants of people of mixed First Nations and European ancestry who share a common culture. However, there are varying definitions of what it means to be Métis, and who is or isn't Métis can be contentious. In most cases, Métis citizens will be a member of a recognized Métis organization and can trace their family lineage to recognized Métis families and geographic locations. See [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous)

**metrication** (not metrification, but avoid both)

**metro** (lowercase for generic use, such as describing new bus routes in a large city as changes to "metro transit"); Metro (when the word is part of a proper noun, such as Metrorail or the Washington Metro). Use Metro to refer to Montreal's subway system (e.g., a Montreal Metro station) even though the word is often all lowercase in English in Quebec to match preferred French capitalization. See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#capitalization) for the relevant guidelines on using English capitalization. See also [the Underground](/home/l#Underground) for style guidelines on London's subway system.

**micro (prefix)**
**microbrewery, microcomputer, microfiche, microfilm, micromanage, micronutrient, microorganism, microsurgery, microwave, microwaveable**

**microphone** (When abbreviating, prefer **mic** over informal shorthand "mike," as outlined in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.)

****midday****

**Middle Ages** (see [historical periods](/home/h/historical-periods))

**Middle East, Mideast** (_never_ Near East) Conventionally means: Iraq, Iran, Israel and the [Palestinian territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestine), Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It does _not_ normally refer to the Sudan or to Islamic countries in northwestern Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria), even though these are sometimes mentioned in stories about the region. It also does _not_ normally mean Afghanistan, which is historically considered to be in Central Asia — sandwiched between the Mideast and the Indian subcontinent. See also [**Middle East glossary**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary) for detailed language guidelines.

**Middle East respiratory syndrome** (see [**MERS**](/home/m#MERS))

**Middle-earth** (When referring to the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien, use his preferred spelling, which features a hyphen and a lowercase "e.") See also [_The Lord of the Rings_](/home/t#TheLordoftheRings)

**Middleton, Catherine** (married Prince William in the spring of 2011; became the **Princess of Wales** in the fall of 2022) Although the diminutive "Kate" can be occasionally used when the tone is highly informal (e.g., Will and Kate), the default preference is now Catherine, including in web headlines and TV banners. See [**royal titles**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-titles/#princewilliam "Royal titles") for more detailed guidelines.

**midget** (_avoid_; considered offensive) See [dwarf](/home/d/disability-language#dwarf)

**Milan, Italy** (not "Milano," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**mileage** (_not_ milage) For metric measurements (e.g., 9.5 L/100 km) use the term "fuel consumption." See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for general guidelines.

**millennium** (-nn-), **millenniums** (See [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals) for a general discussion of words such as aquaria, podia, millennia, symposia)

**millimetre** (metric measurement) When shortened, use "**mm**" alone with no period, singular or plural (akin to km/h) See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial)

**million cubic feet (Mcf)** There is no need to convert from imperial to metric when an industry standard has been established. Natural gas consumption is commonly measured in cubic feet. Spell out the abbreviation in brackets in first reference. See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for detailed guidelines.
****
mill rate*

*Milosevic, Slobodan****

**milquetoast** (not "milk toast") Refers to a timid or overly soft person, based on the name of the 1920s cartoon character Caspar Milquetoast.

**mine** (virtually always lowercase, along the lines of "factory" or "warehouse"), as in the **Jericho mine** in Nunavut, the **Mount Polley copper and gold mine** in B.C. (See [**mines**](/home/m/mines) for details)


**mini**
mini as a prefix is not usually followed by a hyphen unless the term is new, although there are a few exceptions: ****mini-budget, mini-play, mini-restaurant, mini-sub; minibike, minibus, minicar, minicomputer, miniseries miniskirt, minivan*

*miniature****

**minimize** (_not_ -ise)

****minimum, minimums****

**Minister versus minister** (See [titles](/home/t/titles))

[**ministries**](/home/m/ministry) (Capitalize federal and provincial government ministries, even if the name has been shortened)

**Minneapolis** (Minnesota city) The larger of two neighbouring municipalities that make up **the Twin Cities**. The other is **St. Paul, Minn.**, which is the state capital. When referring to the conurbation, it's OK to use a hyphen: **Minneapolis-St. Paul**. This form is also found in some proper nouns, such as **the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport**. (See also [St., Saint, St-, Sainte, Ste-](/home/s/st-saint-ste) for related guidelines)

**Minnesota (Minn.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

****Royal Canadian Mint, the mint****

**minus**, pluses and **minuses**

**minuscule** (_not_ miniscule)

**Minute Rice** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for fast-cooking rice)

**minutia, minutiae**

**mischaracterization, mischaracterize, mischaracterizing**

****misinterpret, misinterpreter, misinterpretation****

**mislead, misled, misleading**

**misogyny** (n.), **misogynistic** (adj.) The meaning of misogyny has broadened beyond "hatred of women" since the late 20th century. It's now defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "hatred or dislike of, or prejudice against, women." Misogyny is not limited to violence, threatening behaviour, etc. It also commonly refers to the dehumanization or objectification of women, including sexist mockery, belittlement, hateful body shaming and other denigration.

**Mississauga, Ont.** (a city just west of Toronto)

**Mississippi (Miss.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**Mississippi Delta** (large, flat area in Mississippi's northwest). Although technically not a delta (a term for land formed at the mouth of a river), Mississippi Delta is the common name for this part of the state. Its initial letters are capitalized. _Do not confuse this noun with the_ **Mississippi River delta**, which is a true delta between the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. To distinguish the two, keep delta lowercase when referring to the latter. The Mississippi River delta is about 500 kilometres south of the Mississippi Delta.

**Missouri (Mo.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

****misspeak, misspoke*

*misspend, misspent****

**misstep**

**mistress** (requires caution) OK when used as the female equivalent of "master" (e.g. a dominant woman in a sadomasochistic relationship). Otherwise, **generally avoid to mean a man's extramarital lover** unless attributed (e.g., in court testimony), since there's no comparable "master" form for a married woman's lover. If adultery is relevant to a story, the detail can often be conveyed in a factual statement (e.g., "Smith said she didn't know her husband had been having an affair for the past five years"). If labels are required, prefer conversational, gender-inclusive words (e.g., **lover**) over lofty alternatives (e.g., **paramour**). Historically, a mistress was not merely an extramarital lover but also financially supported by a man over a long period of time. Regardless, the dated, gender-specific term is at odds with CBC's commitment to preferring inclusive language whenever practical. See also [limiting the '-ess' suffix](/home/e/-ess) for related guidelines.

****mixed martial arts****

**Mixmaster** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for food mixer)

**MK-ULTRA** (all caps, with hyphen) The code name of a mind control program secretly conducted by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency at a psychiatric clinic in Canada in the 1950s and '60s. The two-letter prefix is rooted in an obscure system of CIA cryptonyms. The four-letter suffix reflects an extreme classification level — i.e., "ultra" secret. Although there are many spellings, MK-ULTRA has become relatively entrenched in recent decades. The hyphen helps make the code name easier to read. It also matches the pronunciation. (See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for general caveats about all-uppercase or all-lowercase terms.)

**mm** (See [millimetre](/home/m#millimetre) above)

**MM&A** ([Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway](/home/m#MM&A))

**MMIWG** (missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls) Use the full abbreviation when referring to the inquiry ordered by the federal government in 2016, or to related issues and criminal cases (i.e., prefer MMIWG over MMIW). Generally limit use of such abbreviations to places where space is tight (e.g., web headlines). In French, "women and girls" is covered by two Fs (for _femmes_ and _filles_) in the initials FFADA: _L’Enquête nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassinées_. Always spell out MMIWG at least once in stories. In generic references, all words except Indigenous are lowercase — e.g., **the police investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls**. In the case of the **MMIWG inquiry**, the word inquiry is lowercase unless the full title is given (i.e., the **National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls**). See [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) as well as [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for related guidelines.

**Mob** (for Mafia); **mob** (other uses)

**[m-md](/home/m#m) - [me-mn](/home/m#me) - [mo-my](/home/m#mo) - [bottom](/home/m#bottom)**

**mo-my**

**mock-up** (n. and adj.)

****model, modelled, modelling****

**Mogadishu** (the capital of Somalia)

Mohammed (_use_ [**Muhammad**](/home/m#Muhammad) for the founder of Islam and in all other names unless the person prefers a different spelling)

**Mohamud, Suaad Hagi** (use the [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) Hagi, not _Haji_; use Mohamud in second reference) Canadian woman detained in Kenya for several months during the summer of 2009 in a dispute over the validity of her passport.

**Mohawk** (singular and plural)

**Moldova** (formerly Moldavia)

****mollusk*

*Molotov cocktail****

**Molson Coors Brewing** (The Canadian division is called **Molson Coors Canada**)

**mom, mommy, mommies** (colloquial shorthand for **momma,** which, in turn is a variation of a child's pronunciation of "ma ma." meaning "mother") For consistency, prefer the common North American spelling "mom" over the primarily British version mum (mummy, mummies) in most generic contexts (e.g., **their mom, a mom-and-pop store**). Exceptions are proper nouns (e.g., book titles), attributed verbatim text excerpts from written sources (e.g., the poignant "Mummy" card on top of Princess Diana's coffin in 1997), and other entrenched usage (e.g., the [**Queen Mum**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-titles/#kingvsqueen "Royal titles")). Do not confuse with the adjective [mum](#mum), which means to be silent.

[**money**](/home/m/money) (general guidelines, such as $2.5 million, $90,000, etc.)

**money laundering** (n.), **money-laundering** (adj.), as in a "money-laundering operation"

**monitor** (_not_ moniter)

**monkey, monkeys**

**monsieur** (no abbreviation), ****messieurs****

**monsignor** (abbreviate as **Msgr.** only if context makes the meaning clear) Monsignor is an honorary title in the Roman Catholic Church given to priests for distinguished service. Since Msgr. is not an instantly recognized abbreviation, it's often easiest to spell out in full: **Monsignor Raymond Hanna**, with either Hanna or the monsignor in second reference. The title can also be abbreviated before the person's full name: **Msgr. Raymond Hanna**. If a [priest](/home/p#priest) is a monsignor, there's no need to use the term reverend or the abbreviation [Rev.](/home/r#Rev) The word monsignor is acceptable as a noun (e.g., "The monsignor waved hello").

**Montreal Stock Exchange** (**MX** fine in headlines and second reference) The official name was shortened to the **Montreal Exchange** in 1982 because it deals primarily with derivatives rather than equities. But it's OK to continue to use the noun the Montreal Stock Exchange based on convention. In news stories, the longer name is also more understandable to our general audience. See [**TSX**](/home/t#TSX) for details about the **TMX Group**.

**moon** (See also [space terms](/home/s/space-terms))

**moral** (n., a maxim; adj. correct, ethical, just); **morale** (n., a level of confidence, enthusiasm, determination, etc. that has nothing to do with morality)

**moratorium, moratoriums** (See also [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals))

**more than** (see ['more than' versus 'over'](/home/m/more-than-versus-over))

**more than one** (construction conventionally takes a singular verb) _More than one coat of paint **is** needed; More than one student **has** trouble with calculus._

**morocco leather** (lowercase) See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines

**Mormon** (a member of **the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**) Always include the church's full name at least once in stories, and limit use of the word Mormon to mean **LDS Church member** in second reference. Also, do _not_ call followers of other faiths Mormons, even if the church's name is similar. See [**Mormons and Mormonism**](/home/m/mormon-mormonism) for details.

****Morse code****

**Morsi, Mohammed** (declared winner of Egypt's presidential election in June 2012) Use this [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) rather than other spellings of his first and last name.

**Moscow** (not "Moskva," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

Moslem (_use_ **Muslim**)

**mosque, but Jami Mosque** (See also [Church versus church](/home/c/church))

**Mother** (as in **Mother Teresa**, Mother Marguerite-Thérèse Lemoine Despins) See [Father, Mother, Sister, Brother](/home/f/father-mother-brother-sister) for details

**mother tongue** (_generally AVOID outside of direct attribution_) This once-common term is increasingly considered outmoded because it's perceived as either sexist or inaptly gender specific (e.g., children can learn their first language from two gay fathers, from single, non-binary caregivers, etc.). Alternatives include **first language, birth language** and **native tongue** (as long as the context of "native tongue" is clear and does not misleadingly imply Indigenous language).

**Motley Crue** (_not_ Mötley Crüe) see [umlauts](/home/g/german-names)

**motocross** (cross-country racing on **motorcycles**) The term motocross is spelled "moto-" without an "r" in the second syllable), as in the **ABC Motocross Park**

**motorsport** (the racing of motorized vehicles, especially cars, as a sport) Be aware that some proper nouns are singular and some are plural, such as the **Atlantic Motorsport Park** in Nova Scotia and the **Gimli Motorsports Park** in Manitoba

****motto, mottoes****

**mould** (_not_ mold)

**moult** (_not_ molt)

**mountain slide** (two words) See also [slide as a suffix](/home/s#slidesuffix)

**Mountie, Mounties** (for RCMP) See also [RCMP are versus RCMP is](/home/r/rcmp-are-versus-rcmp-is)

**Mount Sinai, Egypt** (not "Gebel Musa," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Mount Vesuvius, Italy** (not "Vesuvio," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames)) This famous volcano destroyed the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in AD 79.

**mouse** (plural **mice**; avoid "_mouses_," even when referring to computer hardware)

**mousey, mousier** (likening someone or something to a mouse; timid or ineffectual; in the case of hair, a nondescript light brown)

**moustache** (_not_ mus-)

**movable** (_not_ moveable)

**movement** (usually lowercase even after proper nouns) **Black Lives Matter movement, evangelical movement, #MeToo movement, peace movement**; but capitalized in rare cases when unique usage is entrenched and describes a specific [historical  period,](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/historical-periods/ "Historical periods") as in the **Civil Rights Movement** in the U.S. that refers to the campaign for equal rights and justice for Black people in the 1950s and 1960s (versus a generic **civil rights movement**).

****moviegoer*

*Movie Network, the****

**Moxy Fruvous** (not Früvous) see [umlauts](/home/g/german-names)

**MP** (member of Parliament), **MPs** (members of Parliament), **MP's** and **MPs'** (possessive) and **parliamentarian.** In national stories, avoid using less-common short forms for provincial politicians (MPP, MHA, MLA, MNA). See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) and [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)

**m.p.h.** (miles per hour; includes periods, unlike metric abbreviations such as km/h)

**mpox** (new name of **monkeypox** adopted by the World Health Organization in November 2022) Use mpox (pronounced "EM-pocks") in first reference, including headlines, leads, TV banners, etc. It's OK to define briefly in stories once (e.g., "previously called monkeypox" or "formerly known as monkeypox") to avoid confusion until mpox becomes more familiar. This means that **while mpox should be our default choice, it's also crucial to be clear we're not reporting on a new or different disease.** The term monkeypox was coined in the 1950s before WHO guidelines were established to avoid disease names that were stigmatizing, potentially misleading, etc.

**MP3 player, MP3.com** (company)

**MRI** (magnetic resonance imaging) There is no need to spell out the abbreviation. MRIs rely on a gigantic magnet that lines up the nuclei of hydrogen atoms in a patient's body. A computer then generates an image based on how this magnetic field changes when exposed to radio waves. The scans are relatively costly to produce and aren't available at all hospitals or diagnostic centres. MRIs are considered especially valuable for examining soft tissues because these have a high concentration of water (i.e., hydrogen molecules). X-rays, on the other hand, cannot be used to photograph soft tissues. (See also [CT and CAT scans](/home/c/ct-and-cat-scans), which rely on X-rays)

**MS** (OK in headlines and second reference, but generally spell out **multiple sclerosis** at least once); **MS therapy** (See also [Zamboni therapy, so-called "liberation therapy"](/home/z/zamboni-liberation-ms-therapy))

**MT** (mountain time) Avoid specifying MST or MDT. See [time](/home/t/time) for detailed guidelines.

**Mt. Gox** (Toyko-based [bitcoin](/home/b#bitcoin) exchange) Prefer this English spelling over various alternatives, including MTGOX.

****MuchMusic, MuchMoreMusic, MuchMoreRetro****

**mucus** (n.) A slimy substance, including what comes out of your nose. But the adjective, **mucous**, has an "o" in it. So a "mucous membrane" secretes "mucus."

**mudslide** (one word) See also [slide as a suffix](/home/s#slidesuffix)

**Muhammad** (_not_ Mohammed) for the founder of Islam. Use Muhammad in all other names as well, including Muhammad Ali, unless the person prefers a different spelling. To provide context, it's a common and acceptable convention to use **Prophet Muhammad** in first reference and Muhammad after that. Muhammad alone is OK in headlines. See also [prophet versus Prophet](/home/p#prophet)

**mujahedeen** (holy warriors, plural); mujahed (singular) [No italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) (See also [jihad](/home/j/jihad))

**mukluk** (deerskin boot)

**mulatto** (generally avoid using in most news stories) See [mulatto](/home/m/mulatto) for details

**Mulcair, Tom** (became the federal NDP's new leader in 2012) Use Tom rather than "Thomas" because it's [his confirmed preference](/updates/2012/2012-04-03). See also [Leader versus leader](/home/l/leader) for related capitalization guidelines.

**multi-**
multi-multicultural, multilateral, multinational, multimillionaire, multimillion-dollar deal, multimedia, multiplatform, multipurpose, multi-skilled, multi-storey, multitasking, multi-year contract

**multiple sclerosis** (See [**MS**](/home/m#MS))

**mum** (adj.) to be silent, as in **to keep mum**, and **mum's the word** (to say nothing). The term is imitative, because pronouncing the second "m" requires speakers to close their lips.

**mum** (n.) Informal and often affectionate term for mother. Prefer the spelling [**mom**](#mom) in generic contexts.

**Mumbai** (a port city on the west coast of India officially renamed in the 1990s) Use the Hindi form Mumbai in first reference. For context in longer stories, it's OK to point out that the city was formerly called Bombay — a name still preferred by some residents. But this is optional and increasingly unnecessary as the noun Mumbai has become widely known. (See [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations))

**Munich** (not "München," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames)) See also [German names](/home/g/german-names)

**murder** (see [homicide](/home/h/homicide))

**Muscovite** (of Moscow)

**muskellunge, muskie** (either name is OK when referring to this large North American fish) See also [animals](/home/a/animals) for an overview of relevant capitalization guidelines

**Muskoka** (singular; _not_ The Muskokas) Cottage country around the three biggest **Muskoka Lakes** north of Toronto (Lake Rosseau, Lake Joseph and Lake Muskoka); **Muskoka chair** (_prefer_ over Adirondack chair)

**Muslim** (_not_ Moslem)

**must-have, must-read, must-see** (n., adj.) "He must have that spice in the drawer" versus "It's a must-have spice," and "You must see the film" versus "It's a must-see film."

**mute** (_avoid_, along with the label "deaf-mute") See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#mute)

**Muzak** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for recorded background music)

**MV** (nautical term for "motor vessel"); unlike [HMCS](/home/h/hmcs), "the" may be used in front of this craft's name, as in "the MV Canadian Princess" and "the MV Hamilton Transfer."

**MX** (See [Montreal Stock Exchange](/home/m#MontrealExchange))

**myalgic encephalomyelitis** (also known as **chronic fatigue syndrome**) It's OK to use the entrenched term "chronic fatigue syndrome" high in a story because it's clearest to our audience (e.g., "myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly called chronic fatigue syndrome ..."). But generally **prefer ME/CFS in second reference**, to acknowledge the medical community's move away from the old name. **In broadcast scripts, more conversational options include ME alone in second reference**, as well as "the illness," "the syndrome," "the disorder," etc. ME/CFS is a mysterious, complex and disabling condition characterized by overwhelming exhaustion. The term myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) was coined in the 1930s, when the first cases were recorded. The illness was dubbed chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in the 1980s — language that some doctors now argue was a mistake. Critics of the term CFS say it trivializes a serious medical condition, and is akin to calling dementia "chronic forgetfulness syndrome."

**Myanmar** (Use this name of the country throughout stories, including in headlines and leads) OK to add "**also known as Burma**" once in second reference when deemed helpful to audience. The largest city is **Yangon** (formerly called "Rangoon"). For more details, including use of the entrenched English word **Myanmarese**, see **[Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar)**.

### mad cow disease

**Mad cow disease**

**This is the common term for "bovine spongiform encephalopathy."**

It's fine in first reference, but **the disease should be identified** as bovine spongiform encephalopathy **at some point in the story whenever practical**. [Do not use italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

The scientific term can be shortened to **BSE** after that. BSE has no periods and is lowercase when spelled out. (See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for details)

**Do not use the expression "so-called" mad cow disease.** (See [so-called](/home/s/so-called))

Be aware that BSE falls within the umbrella of **transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)**, an umbrella category of incurable, fatal brain diseases that can affect people, cattle, sheep, deer and other animals.

Report on Business Magazine
_but_ The New Yorker magazine

Check the masthead if you're not certain.

The generic word "magazine" doesn’t have to be appended to the names of well-known publications, such as:

**Mass shooting**

There's no consensus over the definition of "**mass shooting**." In our journalism, however, it conventionally means that **at least four people have been killed or wounded by gunfire in a short amount of time** at one or more nearby locations. The figure does not include the deaths or injuries of assailants.


**NOTE:** This style was adopted in May of 2023. Previously, we had generally followed the FBI’s definition of “mass shooting” as at least four people killed. But that narrow meaning raised questions about clear coverage of attacks involving multiple injuries (e.g., a dozen wounded) but few or no deaths. **We continue to use the term “[mass murder](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/homicide/#mass-murder "Homicide")” to mean four or more homicides** at roughly the same time in a small geographical area.



**Background on the number 4**
In January of 2013, the U.S. Congress defined "mass shooting" as three or more deaths in a single incident. and some criminologists began compiling statistics using that figure. Later that year, the FBI adopted a different definition of "at least four people" murdered with a gun in one attack, and the U.S. Congressional Research Service eventually mirrored that metric.

Around the same time, meanwhile, the independent, U.S. non-profit group [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) decided to focus on total casualties rather than just fatalities. As a result, it defined “mass shooting” as at least four or more people dead OR injured in a single attack, not including the assailant.

This has left news organizations divided. In the spring of 2023, for instance, Associated Press continued to define mass shootings as at least four dead, while CNN and some others used the broader definition of at least four dead or injured. A [February 2023 Poynter Institute feature](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/definition-mass-shooting/) provides additional background on the inconsistent approaches.


**Define 'mass shooting' in stories when statistics are quoted**
No reasonable person would ever dispute that, say, the slaughter of a dozen children inside a school is a "mass shooting." So it's often unnecessary to explain why we're using that language in our coverage of such a horrific tragedy. We’re also **not obligated to describe every attack as a “mass shooting” solely because a specific, debatable threshold is met** (e.g., one killed and three injured). Other factors may have a bearing on the language chosen (e.g., a person killing his family and then taking his own life inside a house versus a shooting at a public place like a school, church or shopping mall). Exercise your own judgment.

But **when quoting statistics about the number of "mass shootings" in a given country over a given time period, it's important to define what we mean**, and to make sure that the data we're citing is from sources that measure death and injury tolls the same way. In particular, we should be transparent with our audience about what we mean when reporting a rise or fall in mass shootings from year to year.

Be aware that some people prefer terms like **mass casualty events** instead of mass shootings across the board because they feel that "mass casualty" better reflects the trauma experienced by all victims, including survivors — from the injured and those who saw others gunned down to friends and relatives of the dead. While such language can have its place in stories, the term "mass casualty" is comparatively nebulous (e.g., it could apply to victims of a plane crash, subway explosion, building collapse), and, so, less meaningful without context. But **the spirit of the word "casualty" is worth considering in coverage of mass shootings. The noun conveys death as well as injury, including trauma.** And, so, in addition to reporting the specific number of lives lost and people wounded on a given day, we should remember that there can be countless individuals changed forever by a single mass shooting.

### metric versus imperial

**Metric versus imperial**

[General guidelines](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#generalguidelines) (metric versus imperial)

[Key metric exceptions](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#keyexceptions) (pounds, feet, etc.)

[Distances](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#distances) (kilometres, not hours; map estimates)

[Temperatures](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#temperatures) (C, F, degrees, etc.)

[Spelling out](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout) (cm versus centimetres, etc.)

[Abbreviating](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#abbreviating) (km/h, etc.) 

[Sports](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#sports) (10K run, etc.)

**General guidelines**
**In general, use metric not imperial measurements in news stories.** This includes the heights of airplanes and mountains (metres not feet), the sizes of farms (hectares not acres), most weights (kilograms not pounds), distances, even at sea (kilometres not miles), speeds (km/h), etc.

> _They drove 800 kilometres on a single tank of gas._
>
> _The earth is roughly 150 million kilometres from the sun._
>
> _The cheetah ran the 100-metre dash in 5.95 seconds._
>
> _Winds were clocked at more than 220 km/h when the storm hit._
>
> _The plane was at 7,000 metres when trouble began._
>
> _Mount Everest is estimated to be 8,848 metres._
>
> _The average size of a farm in Saskatchewan is 675 hectares._


**Key metric exceptions**
**The main exceptions are: people's height** (_He was six feet two inches_) and **people's weight** (_185 pounds_), **real estate descriptions** of buildings and standard municipal lots (_1,200-square-foot bungalow and 40 by 100 feet, but 10 hectares_), **some construction materials and hardware** (e.g., half-inch nails and two-by-fours), **certain price ratios entrenched by an industry or commercial sector** (e.g., the lobster fishery's _per pound_ pricing, precious metals reported in troy _ounces_, and natural gas consumption measured in cubic feet) , **various idiomatic expressions** (e.g., _giving an inch, going a mile a minute_), **and other terms established through convention** (e.g., _a ten-gallon hat, a half-ton truck_).

See also [**entrenched industry standards**](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#industrystandards) below for limits to preferences such as "_per pound_ " lobster prices, **[real estate versus land area](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#landarea)** for more on hectares instead of _acres_, as well as **[heights and weights](/home/n/numbers#heightsandweights)** for details on figures versus spelled-out numbers (e.g., six feet two inches can also be informally expressed as 6-2), when to use hyphens (_a 7,100-square-foot mansion versus the mansion was 7,100 square feet_), etc.


**Entrenched industry standards**
**To determine whether metric exceptions apply to certain commercial or industrial contexts, consider how the sector as a whole handles the measurements.** Some farmers may prefer "acres" and some gas station owners may like "gallons," but we would still report on _hectares_ and _litres_ in these cases. On the other hand, since the entire financial sector continues to use _ounces_ for gold, this has become a newsroom preference too. Note: Gold is traditionally measured in troy ounces, which are slightly heavier units, and baldly converting to grams would be inaccurate. In other words, while the adjective _troy_ is implied and normally unnecessary when reporting precious metals, it could not be ignored if we actually decided to perform calculations based on a 12-ounce pound instead of a 16-ounce one.

**Even when an industry standard is imperial** (e.g., the lobster fishery uses per pound rather than per kilogram pricing), **there are limits to such usage**. It would not apply to marine exhibits, grocery sales, cooking, etc. So a CBCNews.ca story about the lobster industry as a whole can use imperial measurements throughout (e.g., _fishermen received $4 per pound_). But a story focused on the century-old lobster Big Dee-Dee caught in New Brunswick in 2008 should report the crustacean’s weight in metric (i.e., _10 kilograms_ rather than _22 pounds_), just as any recipe would be reported in metric (in the case of lobster, beef, chicken, etc.).

**Always keep the best interest of readers in mind when an industry's imperial exceptions are preserved. A metric equivalent in brackets should be considered if it’s deemed helpful.** For instance, in an article about the lobster fishery, the first reference to "per pound" prices could include a metric conversion if the story also happened to feature information about what consumers were paying for the same product in the store (which should be reported as a "per kilogram" ratio):

> _In Nova Scotia last year, lobster prices on the wharf fell to $3.50 per pound ($7.70 per kilogram). By contrast, sale prices for live lobsters in grocery stores dropped to about $13 per kilogram._


Such extra detail should aid a reader’s understanding of the story rather than simply clutter the page with alternative figures and units. Use your judgment.


**Real estate versus land area**
**Living space, factory space, etc., are OK in imperial** (a _600-square-foot apartment_, an _11,000-square-foot_ film studio). Although standard municipal lot sizes can also be reported this way (_40 by 100 feet_) as part of an established real estate convention, all other **land size should generally be reported in metric**, including farms and the amount of damage caused by forest fires. These guidelines are based on common usage. Even when governments or other authorities occasionally specify imperial units in regulations (a _3,000-acre maximum_), CBCNews.ca style is to convert for consistency (_a 1,214-hectare maximum_).


See [dimensions](/home/n/numbers#dimensions) for related guidelines

**Adding metric conversions to quotes**
**If people use imperial measurements in direct quotes, provide metric equivalents either in square brackets or separate sentences if this additional information helps readers.** For instance, clarifying nautical miles is beneficial: _"Ottawa must do more to protect Canada's 200-nautical-mile \[370-kilometre\] fishing limit."_ But converting a commonly understood measurement like "50 yards" would unnecessarily spoil a quote's flow: _"The hunters had walked about 50 yards down the path, just out of sight, when — bang — we heard a gunshot."_ Use common sense.


**Distances (kilometres, not hours; map estimates)**
**Avoid measuring distances in time** (e.g., _the community is one hour west of Toronto_). The duration of a trip can vary substantially, depending on weather, traffic, the type of vehicle, the driver, etc. Include time only when it's relevant (e.g., if an ambulance took 25 minutes to travel a distance normally covered in 10 minutes).

**Generally use "straight-line" map measurements when reporting distances** unless the actual driving stretch is well known (e.g., two nearby communities separated by one road) or essential details of a story are lost with a "crow flies" calculation (e.g., in an article about the trucking industry that benefits from specific reference to the number of actual kilometres logged). For simplicity, **the convention is to estimate distances from the centre of each community** (e.g., from one downtown core to another), partly because a given municipality's official boundary can vary over time through annexation, economic development, etc.

For consistency and accuracy, it's a common practice to measure distances in Canada using the "point-to-point" calculation tool provided by the [Canadian Geographical Names Service](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf) of **Natural Resources Canada**, the same authority we turn to for the official spellings of most geographical names across the country. Its distance calculator is found at the bottom of whatever entry you're starting with (e.g., Winnipeg). Another option is to use a reliable web-based tool such as **Google Maps**. Since all these tools generally rely on universally catalogued latitude and longitude co-ordinates,  the **"straight line" results should be virtually identical** (e.g., the **distance from Winnipeg to Iqaluit** is estimated at **2291 kilometres** on the CGNS website, and **2290 kilometres** on Google Maps, if you start and end in the centre of each community's downtown). 


**Nautical miles**
A mile is 5,280 feet (about 1,600 metres). At sea, the term mile represents a slightly greater distance (i.e., a nautical mile is roughly 1,850 metres). **Generally use metres or kilometres for all distances, whether on land, over water or above the ground.** Consider exceptions when established by convention (e.g., report on "Canada's 200-nautical-mile zone") if this serves our audience best. In these cases, extra information is often helpful (e.g., adding "or about 370 kilometres" in brackets in our web journalism).


**Hectares and acres**
Never refer to "_square hectares_" (or "_square acres_"), since these units are, by definition, already squared. A hectare is 10,000 square metres, while an acre is 4,840 square yards. A hectare is roughly 2.5 times bigger than an acre. (See also [conversions](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#conversions) below)


**Temperatures**
**Prefer a figure and then C when writing temperatures** (instead of using the word "degrees"). Generally report in Celsius unless there is a specific reason to use Fahrenheit, such as in a directly transcribed quote. Always leave a space between the figure and the uppercase letter (C or F). This blank spot not only makes the number stand out, it also represents an invisible degree symbol (˚) in standard typography:

> _17 C_ but never 17 degrees C (the blank spot, itself, indicates "degrees")
>
> _5 C_
>
> _28 C (82 F)_


**Use an "[en dash](/handy-links/punctuation/dash)" (HTML code &#8211;), **not** a hyphen, for the minus sign (–15 C)**. Do not put a space between the dash and the figure:–34 C

The "one to nine" rule (figures under 10 spelled out) only applies to temperatures when the C or F abbreviation is dropped:

> _The room was 8 C._
>
> _The temperature inside the car rose eight degrees._
>
> _The child's body temperature fell two degrees._
>
> _2 C_ or _two degrees_ (but never 2 degrees or 2 degrees C)


**Celsius is generally implied when C or F are dropped.** Write out Celsius and Fahrenheit when they appear on their own as words:

> _28 degrees_
>
> _–15 degrees_
>
> _The agency reported temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit._


For caveats about the term "wind chill," see [weather words](/home/w/weather-words#windchill).


**Spelling out**
**It's OK to use shortened forms** (km, kg, etc.) **where space is limited** (e.g., in headlines, tables, graphics). **Otherwise, spell out most metric units**.

> _The towns are about 60 kilometres apart._
>
> _By dawn, 50 millimetres of [**rain**](/home/w/weather-words#rain) had fallen._
>
> _He walked 40 kilometres carrying a 30-kilogram backpack, which included 20 grams of marijuana and one litre of lemonade._


**The main exceptions are temperatures** (_12 C_), **rates of speed** (_100 km/h_), **fuel consumption** (_8.4 L/100 km_) **and widely used abridged forms** (e.g., _8-mm film,
105-mm cannon, a 100-GB hard drive, a 50-KB file_), which are all OK in first and subsequent references.

Note: When spelling out fuel consumption, drop the capital L for litre (7.8 L/100 km) which is used in the abbreviation to avoid possible confusion with the figure 1:

> _The vehicle also costs less to run, using an average of 7.2 litres of gas per 100 kilometres of highway driving._


If a term is widely used by industry but still relatively uncommon in everyday speech, spell out in full in brackets in first reference. The abbreviation can be used on its own after that. Retain the imperial unit (Mcf) if it's entrenched through convention:

> _Natural gas prices dropped to about $4 Mcf (million cubic feet) in June._


**(Abbreviating) mm, cm, km, kg, etc.**
**When shortened, metric units are both singular and plural. They do not include periods or a letter "s" at the end.** The abbreviations for "square" (sq.) and "cubic" (cu.), however, do include periods. Put a space between the figure and the metric term. When writing adjectives, replace the space with a hyphen (_9-mm handgun_).

See [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games) for more details on CBCSports.ca style


**Conversions**
**Sometimes it makes editorial sense to add an imperial measurement in brackets**, if we think this detail will help a large segment of our audience. **Round figures when converting** (e.g., "_about 300 hectares,_" "_just over 10,000 litres,_" etc.)

NOTE: **It's generally sufficient to round to the nearest half unit** (e.g., 0.5 inches), unless a more precise measurement is deemed necessary for the story (e.g., in medical or scientific reporting):


> _The maximum size of carry-on luggage is 55 by 35 by 20 centimetres (21.5 by 13.5 by 7.5 inches)._


**There are many good spots on the web to convert measurements, including a tool offered by Google.** (All you need is a starting number, the desired units and the word "in." For instance, you type "_125 miles in kilometres_" in Google's search engine and hit enter.)

### Mi'kmaq

**Mi'kmaq versus Mi'kmaw**

[Mi'kmaq](/home/m/mi-kmaq#Mi-kmaq) (plural n.)
[Mi'kmaw](/home/m/mi-kmaq#Mi-kmaw) (singular n., plus default adj.)


**4 rules at a glance**

It's **important to distinguish between these proper nouns**. Here are the basics:


> 1\. Limit use of Mi'kmaq to plural subjects/nouns.
> 2\. Generally avoid adding "people" after Mi'kmaq.
> 3\. Use Mi'kmaw for ALL adjectives, outside of certain established names.
> 4\. Refer to the language, itself, as Mi'kmaw.


The rest of this entry provides details and examples. There's also a section at the bottom summarizing a style shift in the fall of 2020 that expanded our use of "Mi'kmaw" in news coverage.

 See also [pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmtlntapps08.apps.in.cbcsrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D37401&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw34y-u_YZy8pu8duoeNHQSY) (VPN connection required outside CBC)


**Mi'kmaq**

**Mi'kmaq is a plural noun that refers to an Indigenous people** originally from areas now known as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I., Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec. For many years, the word was spelled "Micmac" in English. But the revised transliteration, Mi'kmaq, better reflects the extant Indigenous pronunciation, according to linguists. **Avoid the spelling Micmac** except in rare historical references (e.g., "HMCS Micmac was a destroyer built during the Second World War"). **Mi'kmaq can mean all members of the nation or smaller groups of people:**


> The top court agreed that the treaty rights of **Mi'kmaq** are clear.
> Local **Mi'kmaq** want to sell more lobsters to non-Indigenous people.
> The first hockey sticks were made by the **Mi'kmaq** in the 1800s.
> The **Mi'kmaq** entered the conference room on the third day of talks.


**NEVER add an "s" to Mi'kmaq**, which is already plural. And **generally avoid saying or writing "Mi'kmaq people,"** which is considered quasi-tautological. Mi'kmaq is roughly translated as "allies" or "kin," so the word "people" is already implied. It's similar to why we discourage "Inuit people," which literally means "people" people when translated from Inuktut.


**Mi'kmaw**

**Mi'kmaw is the singular form of Mi'kmaq** (i.e., to describe a member of the Mi'kmaq). But generally **avoid using it as a noun in this context** outside of transcribed quotes (e.g., write "She is Mi'kmaw" NOT "She is a Mi'kmaw," along the lines of "He is Indigenous" and "They are Black" rather than "He is an Indigenous" and "They are Blacks").

**Mi'kmaw is the preferred adjective modifying ANY noun**, whether plural or singular:


> **Mi'kmaw leaders** met with the premier.
> Their exhibit showcases **Mi'kmaw artists**.
> **Mi'kmaw treaty rights** must be respected, the court ruled.
> The **Mi'kmaw delegation** included a poet, a doctor and a retired judge.
> She's a **Mi'kmaw lawyer**.
> The **Mi'kmaw engineering student** won first place.
> He returned to the **Mi'kmaw community** a decade ago.
> The **Mi'kmaw custom** dates back to the 1500s.


**The main exceptions are proper nouns**, which may vary in style — including in spelling. Follow the declared preferences of individual groups:


> The **Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq Chiefs** backed the proposal.
> The **Paqtnkek Mi'kmaw Nation** is near Antigonish, N.S.
> She's a member of the **Listuguj Mi'gmaq government** in Quebec (proper noun), but the **Mi'kmaw** students are from Listuguj, Que.
> **Mi’kmaq Warrior Peacekeepers** came to the wharf the next day.



**TIP:** It can be **useful for English speakers** differentiating between Mi'kmaw and Mi'kmaq **to substitute "Canadian" and "Canadians" in a sentence to see if it sounds right** — even though these words do not function in perfect syntactical parallel. For instance, "A fishery **regulated by Mi'kmaq**" versus "A **Mi'kmaw-regulated** fishery" corresponds to "A fishery regulated by Canadians" versus "A Canadian-regulated fishery." It would be unorthodox to write "A Canadians-regulated fishery." It's equally illogical and jarring to write "A Mi'kmaq-regulated fishery," according to these guidelines..



**Mi'kmaw language**

**Mi'kmaw is the name of the Algonquian language** written and spoken by Mi'kmaq:


> He said the prayer in **Mi'kmaw**, English and French.
> Ji'ka'we'katik Trail comes from a **Mi'kmaw name** for "place where bass are plentiful."
> The word caribou is an English version of the **Mi'kmaw word** for "snow shoveller."
> They say the French word Gaspé likely comes from the **Mi'kmaw term** for territorial edge.
> Her [**Mi'kmaw version of the Beatles song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99-LoEkAA3w&feature=youtu.be) Blackbird went viral on YouTube in 2019.


Be aware that the language is in flux and that there are regional dialects affecting certain pronunciations. See the 2019 CBC Indigenous feature [Original Voices](https://www.cbc.ca/originalvoices/?maplang=mikmaw) for more information about the Mi'kmaw language.


**Shift in CBC News style**

**Since CBC News reports in English, we don't normally insist on adopting another language's rules of grammar, syntax, etc.**, when alternative English conventions exist. **But we balance this approach with the equally important principle of respect for handling proper nouns** in a way that's preferred by specific communities, whenever practical.

In the **case of Mi'kmaq and Mi'kmaw**, there's been **a gradual shift away from using the former across the board**. In 2017, **CBC became one of the first major news organizations to start incorporating "Mi'kmaw" as an adjective for singular nouns**, based on requests by some Indigenous speakers. This more complex style was classified as relatively uncommon but acceptable by the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage. A few years later, however, **Mi'kmaw scholars flagged the approach as flawed**. They **disputed the use of Mi'kmaq as an adjective in any construction** (singular or plural). They **also said their language should be referred to as Mi'kmaw** rather than as "Mi'kmaq."


**ACKNOWLEDGMENT:** When we overhauled this entry in 2020, particularly helpful feedback came from Nova Scotia linguist Bernie Francis — co-founder of "Francis-Smith orthography," a spelling system officially recognized by Nova Scotia's Mi’kmaw chiefs.

### Middle East glossary

**Middle East glossary**

Certain topics require special care. They're highly controversial and under intense scrutiny by all sides. Middle East coverage falls into this category. Is it a _border_ or a _line_, a _fence_ or a _barrier_, _occupied_ or _disputed_ territory? Some common shorthand is imprecise or easily perceived as biased, while other terms are simply incorrect. 

This Mideast glossary reflects CBC News style. Entries are based on the journalistic principles of accuracy, clarity, impartiality and fairness.

[At a glance](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#ataglance) (Key terms in brief)
[](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#glossaryindex) (List of all glossary entries)

**At a glance**
[**East Jerusalem**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem) – Occupied. It was captured and then annexed by Israel after the 1967 war.
[**West Bank**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) – Occupied by Israel.
[**Gaza Strip**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) – Technically not occupied. Israeli forces withdrew in 2005, although Israel largely controls all movement in and out.
[**Golan Heights**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#golanheights) – Occupied. It was captured and annexed by Israel after the 1967 war.
[**Hamas**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas) – Militant group democratically elected in the Gaza Strip and West Bank to head a unity government with Fatah in 2006. Seized control of Gaza in 2007, throwing Fatah out.
[**Palestine vs. Palestinian territories**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestine) – There is no modern country of Palestine, although Palestinians want to establish one as part of a two-state solution.
[**barrier**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#barrier) – Avoid security fence, anti-terror fence, apartheid wall, etc.
[**border**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#border) – Many of Israel's borders are actually ceasefire lines, so nuanced language such as boundary is often necessary.
[**right of return**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#rightofreturn) – When referring to Palestinian refugees, use "fled or were forced out" of Israel in 1948 or 1967 wars.
[**settlements**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#settlement) – Jewish settlements in occupied territories are illegal. Avoid neighbourhoods or Israeli housing.
[**terrorist/terrorism**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#terroristterrorism) – Avoid labelling specific people or acts this way without attribution. As a rule, describe rather than judge the person or act (e.g., a bomber, a bombing).

**MAIN GLOSSARY**
**antisemitic** — A widely used and normally acceptable term to describe bigotry against Jewish people, from subtle prejudice to open hostility. But it's often a poor choice in stories focused on the Middle East since Arabs are also Semitic people, a word that broadly refers to a family of languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Maltese). In these cases, more specific language is preferred (e.g., anti-Israel or anti-Jewish, depending on the facts). Just because people oppose the state of Israel's policies, or even the existence of the Jewish state (an anti-Zionist) doesn't make them antisemitic. Such critics include Jews, themselves. TYPOGRAPHICAL NOTE: CBC News adopted the fused, lowercase spelling in the spring of 2021, along with AP, CP and others: **antisemitic, antisemitism, antisemite**. The previous spelling (anti-Semitic, anti-Semitism, anti-Semite) was standard for more than a century. In recent years, a growing number of Jewish organizations have adopted the new rendering, partly in response to critics who said the capital "S" was misleading. See the [International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's memo on the spelling of antisemitism](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/bdhdpv4z/ihra_memo-on-spelling-of-antisemitism_april-2015.pdf "IHRA Memo On Spelling Of ANTISEMITISM April 2015") for additional background.

**Arab** — Originally from what is now Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries, Arabs live throughout the [Middle East](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#mideast) and beyond. Never use as a synonym for Muslim. The word Arab refers to a Semitic people and is tied to language, culture and geography rather than to religion. Since most Arabs are Muslim, relevant references to other faiths are sometimes helpful, depending on the story (e.g., Arab Christians living in Lebanon). The preferred adjective is Arab (Arab leaders, old Arab autocracies). The noun Arabic refers to language.

**assassination vs. targeted killing** — [Assassination](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/assassination/ "Assassination") is an acceptable term to describe the intentional killing of a prominent person, especially a political or religious leader. (e.g., Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981). Targeted killing is an increasingly common alternative used by governments, especially when the country carrying out the attack has laws or special executive orders in place that prohibit assassinations (e.g., in 2010 the Obama administration authorized the "targeted killing" of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Muslim cleric believed to be hiding in Yemen). Since targeted killing is clear, neutral, and not actually euphemistic — assassinations themselves are essentially targeted killings — it's OK in our journalism. But there's no need to shy away from the potentially more controversial words assassinate or assassination, as long as the facts fit the story.

**barrier** (not fence or wall) — Many different labels have been assigned to the structure that Israel began building between its citizens and the Palestinian population in the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) in 2002. But words such as "fence" and "wall" are inadequate descriptions of the combination of trenches, razor wire, concrete slabs and electric fencing. Instead, use the terms **barrier, West Bank barrier, separation barrier**, etc. Israel prefers "security barrier," but given the structure's evolution that adjective is hotly contested and, so, shouldn't be used without attribution. For the same reason, avoid loaded adjectives like "apartheid" wall. Never imply that it follows the [Green Line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline). The barrier actually zigzags through large parts of the West Bank, depending on where Jewish populations live, and does not merely follow the old armistice line. In the case of [Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#jerusalem) or some West Bank communities (e.g., Qalqilya), it's an accepted convention to use the terms "wall" and "barrier" interchangeably.

**border vs. line** — A border is a permanent boundary widely recognized internationally (e.g., Israel's border with Egypt). A ceasefire or armistice line is a preliminary boundary, drawn when fighting stops but not officially ratified as part of a peace agreement. Many of Israel's "borders" are technically ceasefire lines. So when reporting on the region's politics or peace negotiations, nuanced language is necessary (e.g., the boundary between Israel and the West Bank, 1967 boundary lines, prewar boundaries). But when reporting on narrower topics that simply require clear locators (e.g., violence along a particular boundary on any given day), using the word border is an accepted convention (e.g., "Israel's border with the West Bank"), since the armistice line is a de facto border. See also [Green Line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline).

**collective punishment** — A common way to describe sweeping measures taken by Israel against a large number of Palestinians, such as a mass curfew, in response to threats from a much smaller group (sometimes only one or two people). The term is frequently used by UN officials and other critics of Israel's [Gaza blockade](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazablockade). They say Israel has a right to respond to security threats but should not collectively punish everyone living in the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) for attacks from Palestinian-controlled territory. Although collective punishment is listed as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, in that context it's often more narrowly interpreted to mean the mass and indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilians.

**destruction of Israel** — Be cautious when reporting that people or groups advocate the destruction of Israel. If facts are not in dispute, attribution is unnecessary (e.g., the militant group Islamic Jihad wants to replace the state of Israel with a Palestinian state, and [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas) still calls for Israel's destruction, no matter how some of its supporters qualify the language). Otherwise attribution is crucial. For instance, during a speech in Tehran in 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reportedly said "Israel must be wiped off the map." But the English translation has subsequently been challenged, and Ahmadinejad, himself, has said he meant only the collapse of Israel's government. So while it might be accurate to say that Israel fears Iran wants it wiped off the map, or that some people think that's what Ahmadinejad meant, it's misleading to baldly report that Iran wants the state of Israel annihilated. **CBC's ombudsman has responded to complaints about various references to the 2005 remarks and ruled that we are violating accuracy standards if we state without attribution that Ahmadinejad called for the destruction of Israel.**

**East Jerusalem** — It's OK to use the word "occupied" if an adjective is needed in a story (**occupied East Jerusalem**). While the modifier is often unnecessary in generic references, it's a good practice to include "occupied" in stories about evictions, demolitions, protests, etc., in East Jerusalem neighbourhoods to give our audience key background/context. Israel captured East Jerusalem in [1967](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967) and then annexed it in 1980. But its claim to this half of the city is not recognized internationally. Canada, the United States, Britain, the European Union and most other members of the international community consider East Jerusalem [occupied territory](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories), like the West Bank. It includes [Old Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#oldjerusalem), where historic religious sites stand that are important to Jews, Muslims and Christians. See also [Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#jerusalem).

**extremist vs. fundamentalist** — In a religious context, the word extremist suggests a zealot or fanatic engaged in some type of "holy war." This person is not merely an advocate of a strict interpretation of a doctrine. The individual is also prepared to go to extreme measures (including violence) in a campaign to promote this religious belief. By contrast, fundamentalism alone does not mean militancy. A fundamentalist subscribes to (and generally, but not always, advocates) what is perceived to be the literal truth of a given religion's holy writings. Millions of law-abiding citizens of many different faiths are fundamentalists. Far fewer are extreme fundamentalists or militant fundamentalists. Since extremists are not limited to a particular faith, always specify relevant detail (e.g., a Christian extremist, an Islamic extremist). A separate Language Guide entry ([**fundamentalist, extremist, militant**](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist)) provides more details and examples. See also [Islamist](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#islamists), as well as special caveats around the term [terrorist](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#terroristterrorism).

**Fatah** — Started in the late 1950s as a resistance group, Fatah became the foundation of Yasser Arafat's Palestine National Liberation Movement. The political party was a dominant force within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and then the undisputed ruling faction of the [Palestinian Authority](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority) for years. But Fatah has lost influence since Arafat's death in 2004. Critics accuse it of being outdated and corrupt. Fatah is considered a secular nationalist party, unlike its Islamic rival faction [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas), which has ruled the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) since 2007.

**Gaza blockade** — Set up by Israel in 2007, it virtually cuts off the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) from the outside world. Israel continues to control most of the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza, including aid supplies from relief agencies, although specific restrictions have changed over time. Egypt looks after its own border with the territory, including the Rafah crossing. Israel's blockade began after the militant group [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas) took control of Gaza. Israel says it must defend itself against rocket attacks and other threats. But critics consider the blockade an unjust and inhumane [collective punishment](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#collectivepunishment) of more than a million civilians in Gaza. Some organizations, such as the International Red Cross, say the blockade violates international law.

**Gaza Strip** — A narrow swath of land along the Mediterranean. Gaza is an acceptable clipped form, even in first reference. Israel captured the area from Egypt during the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967). Jewish settlers then moved in. Decades later, Israel evicted the settlers as it handed over control of the land to Palestinian leaders. In 2005, Israel withdrew the last of its troops from the Gaza Strip but continued to maintain control over airspace, seafront and virtually all movement into or out of the area. A notable exception is the territory's border with Egypt, including the Rafah crossing, which is under Cairo's authority. Instead of referring to the end of occupation — a term disputed by Palestinians — it's more neutral to describe the end of Israel's permanent military presence in the Gaza Strip. See also [occupied territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories). The militant group [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas) has ruled Gaza since 2007. The term [Gazan](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/g/#Gazan "G") (plural Gazans) is OK in occasional second reference to residents of the enclave.

**Golan Heights** — A rocky plateau that Israel captured from Syria during the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967). UN observers have monitored a ceasefire line since 1974. Although Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, the move has not been recognized by the international community, which still considers the region [occupied territory](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories).

**Green Line** — The boundary between Israel and the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank). It's technically a line not a border because it's based on a mid-century ceasefire rather than an actual peace agreement. (See [border vs. line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#border) for preferred usage.) The Green Line is more formally known as the 1949 armistice line, drawn when the [1948 Israeli-Arab war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1948) ended. A key issue in negotiations to create a Palestinian state is whether pre-1967 boundaries should be the starting point of mutually agreed land swaps. Palestinians favour this, but Israel rejects the return of [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem). The term Green Line requires a brief definition, if used.

**Hamas** — The Palestinians' largest militant group, Hamas takes its name from the Arabic initials for the Islamic Resistance Movement. When created in 1987, the founding documents called for the [destruction of Israel](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#destructionofisrael). Its stated goals include driving all Israeli forces from [occupied territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories) and setting up an Islamic state. Many countries, including Israel and Canada, consider Hamas a [terrorist](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#terroristterrorism) organization for carrying out suicide bombings and other attacks. The Islamic militant group has controlled the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) since 2007, after defeating rival faction [Fatah](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#fatah) in Palestinian Legislative Council elections a year earlier. See also [Palestinian Authority](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority).

**Hezbollah** — A Lebanon-based [Shia](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#shia) militant group formed in 1982 primarily to combat occupying Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. It also has a political wing. The name means "Party of God" in Arabic. It's considered a [terrorist](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#terroristterrorism) organization by many countries, including Canada and the U.S.

**intifada** — An Arabic word to describe more than one Palestinian uprising over the decades. When using it, specify the time period you mean (e.g., at the start of the first intifada in 1987, during the second intifada that began in the fall of 2000). Prefer this [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) over alternatives, such as "intefadeh."

**Islamists** — Followers of a political and cultural movement known as Islamism. They believe that the Qur'an should rule all aspects of life (religious, political and personal). A common implication is: A Muslim radical or extremist who not only believes that Western values are eroding Islam but who is prepared to use violence to create Islamic states that promote fundamental doctrines and enforce Shariah law (the legal code of Islam). See also [**Islam**](/home/i/islam) for more details, including why common alternatives such as Islamic radicals or Muslim extremists are often recommended, as long as the facts fit the story. Never confuse Islamists with Islamicists, who are scholars or experts on Islamic culture, history, religion, etc.

**Israeli-Palestinian conflict** — Unresolved issues include final borders, the future of [Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#jerusalem) as well as the fate of Palestinian refugees (i.e., their "[right of return](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#rightofreturn)" claim) and Jewish [settlements](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#settlement). It's part of the larger Arab-Israeli conflict in the [Middle East](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#mideast), which began with the [1948 Arab-Israeli war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1948). So while a lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians has the potential to make the region more stable, it's an exaggeration to report it as an agreement to "bring peace to the Middle East."

**Jerusalem** — Designated Israel's capital, although recognition has been withheld by many countries. Refer to it by name rather than using the label "capital." The city was effectively divided between 1948 and 1967, with Israel controlling West Jerusalem and Jordan controlling [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem), including [Old Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#oldjerusalem). Israel captured East Jerusalem during the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967) and annexed it in 1980, a claim not recognized internationally. Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is in Jerusalem, as well as the residences of the president and prime minister. But most foreign embassies are in [Tel Aviv](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#telaviv). East Jerusalem is still considered [occupied territory](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories), and reaching a consensus over its status remains one of the more contentious issues in the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict).

**jihad** — Acceptably defined as a "holy war" carried out by certain Muslims against enemies of their faith. From the Arabic term for "to strive," it can also more broadly mean a struggle to improve oneself or to do good. But since it's closely associated with violence, any other meaning needs to be specified in a story. Some Islamic scholars argue that jihad is often misused because a true holy war must be in self-defence. The word is found in the names of several well-known organizations, including the Islamic Jihad, a militant group that vows to destroy Israel and set up an Islamic Palestinian state.

**Middle East, Mideast** (never "Near East," now considered archaic) — The Middle East conventionally means: Iraq, Iran, Israel and the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It does not normally refer to the Sudan or to the Islamic countries in northwestern Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria), even though these are sometimes mentioned in stories about the region. It also does not normally mean Afghanistan, which is historically considered to be in Central Asia — sandwiched between the Mideast and the Indian subcontinent.

**Nakba** — Arabic for "catastrophe." This is how Palestinians describe Israel's declaration of independence in [1948](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1948), which led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Always use balanced wording such as "fled or were forced from their homes," for reasons outlined under [right of return](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#rightofreturn). Prefer the English definite article (i.e., **the Nakba** rather than "al" Nakba). It's useful to remind our audience that Israel's statehood celebration (Independence Day) is marked by Palestinians as a disaster (**Nakba Day**). The actual commemoration dates are different, however. The former changes each year, based on the Hebrew calendar, while the latter is normally held May 15th. Not to be confused with **Naksa Day** in June, marking Palestinian displacement after the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967).

**1948 Arab-Israeli war** — The first major conflict between Israel and its neighbours (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt) began hours after the Jewish state declared independence. Technically fighting continued into early 1949. The armistice, signed in 1949, did not formally determine borders. Instead, a [Green Line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline) was established. During the [Six Day War in 1967](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967), Israel expanded control over territory.
**
1967 Arab-Israeli war** — Also known as the 1967 Six Day War. During the fighting, Israel took over [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem) and the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) from Jordan, the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) and the [Sinai Peninsula](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#sinai) from Egypt, and the [Golan Heights](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#golanheights) from Syria. See also [Green Line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline) for background on the meaning of "pre-1967 boundaries" in modern-day peace talks.

**occupied territories** — This term conventionally refers to Israeli military occupation of the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) and [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem). It also technically applies to the [Golan Heights](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#golanheights) (taken from Syria during [1967](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967)). While context generally makes the meaning clear, avoid lumping the Golan Heights into stories about the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict). The adjective "occupied," used by the United Nations, is more meaningful to our audience than "disputed," since it underscores military control over the region. Avoid referring to the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) as occupied without attribution, since Israel declared an end to its occupation of that region in 2005. Palestinians argue that the occupation continues, since Israel still controls the airspace, seafront and virtually all movement into or out of the region. For this reason, it's preferable to refer to the end of Israel's permanent military presence in the Gaza Strip rather than an end to its occupation, since the former is factual while the latter's meaning is debated.

**Old Jerusalem** — The ancient walled city is part of [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem). Old Jerusalem is short for **the Old City of Jerusalem**, also known as **the Old City**. All three versions are acceptable, as long as the context makes the proper noun clear. Old Jerusalem includes historic religious sites important to Judaism, Islam and Christianity. What the Jews call the Temple Mount is known as Haram Ash-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, to Muslims. It includes the Dome of the Rock mosque. At the foot of the western edge of the Temple Mount is the [Western Wall](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westernwall), sometimes known as the Wailing Wall, one of the most sacred sites in Judaism.

**outposts** — Very small [Jewish settlements](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#settlement). They're often ramshackle living quarters, sometimes little more than a caravan or two on a remote hilltop. Outposts are set up for various reasons, from expanding a nearby settlement's boundaries to defying the Israeli government. Some are considered "unauthorized" by Israel. In that case, it's OK to call them "unauthorized" if this detail is relevant to the story but avoid labelling them as "illegal." According to the UN, all Jewish settlements in the [occupied territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories) are unlawful, including outposts, and calling some "illegal" implies that others are not.

**Palestine vs. Palestinian territories** — There is no modern country of Palestine, although there's a movement to establish one as part of a [two-state](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#twostatesolution) peace agreement with Israel. So **do not refer to Palestine as an independent country without attribution** or show a map with Palestine as a sovereign state. Use the term "pro-Palestinian" instead of "pro-Palestine" when referring in generic ways to Palestinian supporters. Areas under the control of the [Palestinian Authority](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority) are considered Palestinian territories: [Fatah](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#fatah)\-run [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) and [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas)\-run [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip). The terms Palestinian territories and [occupied territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories) are not synonymous. The former includes the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip), where Israel no longer maintains a permanent military presence. The latter includes the [Golan Heights](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#golanheights), which Israel and Syria are at odds over. **The name Palestine is fine in established proper nouns** (e.g., the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestine Children's Relief Fund). In November 2012, the United Nations voted to grant "non-member observer state" status to Palestine. We can accurately mention this in stories when relevant. But the UN does not grant nationhood, and it remains premature to call Palestinian territories the country of Palestine. Take the same approach with other global bodies. **Be fact-based and fair. For instance, it's fine to say that the International Olympic Committee lets qualified athletes compete for a team called Palestine.** But just as with the UN, the IOC does not resolve disagreements over disputed territory or declare the existence of sovereign states. So when covering events such as the Olympics, generally refer to the Palestinian flag, Palestinian athletes, etc., to avoid confusion and inconsistency. When making references to historical Palestine, use clear language (e.g., "British Palestine" is the accepted term for the British Mandate of Palestine, which administered the region between 1920 and the birth of Israel in 1948).

**Palestinian** — The preferred term for people of Palestinian descent. It can be a noun (the Palestinians) or modifier (a Palestinian refugee). Do not use Palestinian as a synonym for Muslim or Israeli as a synonym for Jewish. Specify where people are living when it's relevant. In the case of the [Palestinian territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestine), be aware that the word "resident" is deemed offensive by some because it's perceived to minimize citizenship granted by the [Palestinian Authority](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority) (implying a kind of "permanent residency" status instead). For this reason, generally prefer "Palestinian" over labels like "Palestinian resident" or "resident of the Palestinian territories." In the case of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, use neutral, fact-based references (e.g., "Palestinian citizens of Israel") rather than vague or disputed labels (e.g., the "Arab minority" and "internal Arabs").

**Palestinian Authority** — An administrative body based in Ramallah that governs [Palestinian territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestine) (i.e., the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) and parts of the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank)). Although it changed its name to the "State of Palestine" in January 2013, we and most major news services continue to call it the Palestinian Authority to avoid audience confusion (i.e., an administrative body cannot unilaterally turn itself into a "state"). The Palestinian Authority deals with everything from security to health and education. The full name, Palestinian National Authority, is optional but unnecessary in first reference. It was formed in 1994 under the Oslo peace accords between Israel and Yasser Arafat's PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). The PA was intended to be a provisional government of Palestinian-controlled parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip until a peace agreement led to the creation of a Palestinian state. [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem) was specifically excluded from the accords. In 2007, the Palestinian Authority became divided by bickering between [Fatah](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#fatah)\-run West Bank and [Hamas](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#hamas)\-run Gaza Strip. But in April 2011, both factions renewed abandoned plans to form a unity government. The PA's parliament is the **Palestinian Legislative Council**.

**peace in the Middle East** — This is a sweeping statement about a very big and diverse region. A solution to the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict) is not the same thing as peace throughout the Middle East.

**right of return** — This expression is based on a principle of international law, adopted by the United Nations, backing any person's right to return to her or his country of origin. In Middle East coverage, it's important to specify who is claiming the right to return where (e.g., Israel has a Law of Return that gives all Jews the right to seek Israeli citizenship through immigration). In the case of Palestinians, the phrase "who fled or were forced out of their homes" during the [1948](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1948) and [1967](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967) Arab-Israeli wars is a balanced way to describe refugees claiming the right of return. That's because there's disagreement over why hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became displaced (i.e., Israelis say the Palestinians left on their own to avoid war started by their Arab neighbours while Palestinians say they were forced out by the threat of ethnic cleansing). The right of return of Palestinian refugees is a key issue in the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict) since Israel considers the sheer number of people a threat to the future of the Jewish state. Today, more than four million UN-registered Palestinian refugees claim links to the 1948 exodus. Always attribute refugee numbers to specific sources. See also [Nakba](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#nakba).

**security barrier** — Avoid. See [barrier](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#barrier).

**settlement vs. housing**— The widely used term "settlement" is generally the clearest choice when referring to Israeli communities in [occupied territories](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories). The Jewish settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees and has actively supported expansion in some areas through government subsidies. The term settlement conveys far more information to our audience than the generic word housing, which could refer to any residential areas. It can be helpful, however, to add details when known and relevant (e.g., some settlements are actual villages or small cities while others are old neighourhoods in [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem) that were Jewish even before the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967)). Always attribute specific numbers of settlers to sources. Be sure related language is accurate (e.g., distinguish between construction of new settlements that's "frozen" rather than merely limited through curbed government subsidies). Really small and remote settlements are sometimes called [outposts](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#outposts).

**Shia** — The second-largest branch of [**Islam**](/home/i/islam), followed by an estimated 10 to 15 per cent of the world's Muslims. Most live in Iran and Iraq, where they are in the majority, as well as in Pakistan and India where they remain in the minority. Lebanon also has a sizable number of Shia Muslims. Avoid other transliterations, including Shiite. Shia is a noun and an adjective. The plural is Shias. See also [Sunni](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#sunni).

**Sinai Peninsula** — A triangular peninsula in Northeast Egypt. Israel took control of it during the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967) but then withdrew all military forces and civilians as part of a peace agreement with Egypt in 1979.

**Sunni** — The largest branch of [**Islam**](/home/i/islam), followed by an estimated 85 per cent of the world's Muslims. Sunni is a noun and an adjective. The plural is Sunnis. See also [Shia](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#shia).

**Tel Aviv** — Although Israel's seat of government is in [Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#jerusalem), most foreign embassies are in the coastal city of Tel Aviv. When Israel was founded, Tel Aviv was the state government's temporary centre. In 1949, however, Israel declared Jerusalem its capital. Refer to Tel Aviv by its name alone. Never call it the capital or administrative capital. Do not use it to represent Israel or the Israeli government as a synecdoche or other figure of speech. See also [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem).

**terrorist, terrorism** — Exercise extreme caution. Don't judge specific acts as "terrorism" or people as "terrorists." Instead, describe the act (e.g., bombing, shooting) or individual (e.g., bomber, gunman) and then let our audience decide. While terrorism generally implies attacks against unarmed civilians for political, religious or some other ideological reason, it's a highly controversial term that can leave journalists taking sides. It's OK to refer to terrorists and terrorism in general (e.g., the war against terrorism, antiterrorism legislation). But attribute any specific references (e.g., if officials call an attack an act of terrorism, if one or more governments classify a group as a terrorist organization). See the separate Language Guide entry on [**terrorist and terrorism**](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) for more details and examples, as well as the entry on [**fundamentalist, extremist, militant**](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist) for related guidelines.

**two-state solution** — A proposal to settle the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict) by creating two sovereign countries: the Jewish state of Israel and a separate Palestinian state. The exact borders, including control over [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem), are a contentious issue in peace talks. Not everyone favours a two-state solution, including Arabs who refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. Since "two state" is self-explanatory, no definition is required. By contrast, the lesser-known term "three-state solution" requires background, if used. The latter refers to a proposal that the [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) and the [West Bank](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) be put under the control of the countries that held them before the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967) — Egypt and Jordan, respectively — once Israel's [borders](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#border) are finally agreed on.

**unilateral statehood** — Refers to Palestinians declaring statehood on their own. Also called a **unilateral declaration** of statehood. Supporters say it can increase Palestinians' leverage in legal arguments over occupied territory as well as in negotiations with Israel. Critics say an effective [two-state](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#twostatesolution) solution to the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict) can be reached by negotiations only. Be sure to specify declared borders (e.g., [pre-1967 boundaries](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967)). Keep in mind that Palestinians have unilaterally proclaimed statehood several times since Israel was created in [1948](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1948). For example, in 1988 the UN General Assembly "acknowledged" a statehood declaration by Palestinians without actually voting on endorsing recognition of Palestine as a country. And in November 2012, the UN General Assembly voted to grant "Palestine" non-member observer state status. But the United Nations, itself, does not have the authority to grant statehood. Furthermore, the UN Security Council has veto powers over granting full membership to the United Nations, which means the General Assembly cannot simply admit a unilaterally declared state of Palestine into the UN on its own.

**West Bank** — The full noun, "West Bank of the River Jordan," is implied and unnecessary. Israel seized it from Jordan during the [1967 war](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#1967). This [occupied territory](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#occupiedterritories) includes [East Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#eastjerusalem) and many historically significant communities, such as Bethlehem and Jericho. Much of the West Bank is under Palestinian control and, so, acceptably referred to as Palestinian territory. It's also where the [Palestinian Authority](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority) is based. There is no officially agreed on [border](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#border) with Israel. Instead, there's a so-called [Green Line](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#greenline) tied to a 1949 armistice. The West Bank and [Gaza Strip](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#gazastrip) are central to the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#israelipalestinianconflict). Since there's a dispute over the exact population of the West Bank, including the number of Israelis living there in Jewish [settlements](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#settlement) as well as the number of Palestinian refugees claiming a [right of return](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#rightofreturn), always attribute figures.

**Western Wall** — The preferred name of this spot in [Old Jerusalem](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#oldjerusalem). Although Wailing Wall is OK in transcribed quotes, it's actually a European term describing passionate praying at the site, where Jews feel close to God but also mourn the loss of their historic temple.

### migrant\_foreign\_worker

**Migrant workers, temporary foreign workers**

**Migrant worker** is an entrenched and generally acceptable term for **a foreign worker performing unskilled or low-skilled labour on short-term contracts.** The word **"migrant" traditionally means "on the move"** in English and is **not inherently pejorative.** It instantly conveys the sense of itinerant employees (e.g., fruit and vegetable pickers going from one crop to another, and one location to another, over different growing seasons).

**Temporary foreign worker** is synonymous with migrant workers in some contexts, but it **can imply a much broader and more diverse pool of labour.** This **includes employees brought to Canada to perform skilled jobs on longer-term contracts** (e.g., teachers, software engineers, computer programmers, chefs, stone masons). Furthermore, under the [federal government's temporary foreign worker program](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Femployment-social-development%2Fservices%2Fforeign-workers.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1IsUola5WaKUsRsaaBl3NH), certain applicants may be eligible to become permanent residents.

Be aware that some people object to "migrant" as both a noun and an adjective, even though it's been a neutral, fact-based description of people journeying from one place to another since the 1700s — either in search of a new permanent home or to set up a temporary residence for a specific reason, such as short-term work. While it's **OK to refer to migrant workers as temporary foreign workers**, it's not required.

**Alternative phrasing is acceptable as long as it's accurate, clear and conversational**. For instance, "seasonal agricultural workers" is too ambiguous because it could apply to, say, students and other Canadian citizens hired for the summer. By contrast, **seasonal foreign workers** would be fine as a synonym for migrant workers if the context were clear (e.g., that they're working on farms).

Be aware, too, that some employers insist that their workers are not "migrants" because they're on long-term contracts. The employees, however, may actually enjoy very little job security or other assumed rights. It's one of the reasons that **the [Canadian Council for Refugees](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fccrweb.ca%2Fen%2Fmigrant-workers-issues&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0vRugs62Pjnp9itUvSX89Y) and other advocacy groups commonly use the label "migrant workers" when laying out various challenges faced by certain foreign employees**, especially those performing manual labour and other low-skilled work.

See also [refugee, asylum seeker, migrant](/home/r/refugee) for related guidelines, including why we **avoid the modifier "illegal" when describing people** (e.g., do not refer to "illegal migrants").


### Military forces

**Military forces**

**Soldiers, sailors, air personnel**
In general, the land, sea and air units within a military can be referred to as **the army, navy** and **air force**. Sometimes, a **special forces** unit or command outside of the military's main three branches is worth noting when relevant to the story (e.g., Joint Task Force 2, known as JTF2 in second reference, is a counter-terrorism response unit of the Canadian Special Forces Operational Command).

Members of the army, navy and air force are known as **soldiers**, **sailors** and **air personnel** (preferred over "airmen" and "airwomen"). Never assume that someone in the air force is a pilot. The person could be anything from a cook or mechanic to a meteorologist or aerospace engineer.


**Troops, squads, platoons, etc.**
**Troop** technically refers to a military unit. But it's an imprecise word. **The plural term "troops" is acceptable to describe members of a military group** (e.g., "About 100 troops attacked the camp"), **but avoid using it in the singular as a substitute for soldier**.

Definitions of military units vary widely. In Canada, some typical ranges are: a **squad** or **section** has fewer than a dozen members, a **platoon** between about 35 and 50, a **company** between about 125 and 150, a **battalion** between about 375 and 600, and a **brigade** between about 1,200 and 2,000). **Given the inexact meanings of many of these words, however, and the fact that most people outside the military haven't memorized the jargon, it's best to provide specific troop numbers when known.**


**Canadian Armed Forces, Canadian Forces**
**Capitalize _Armed Forces_ or _the Forces_ only when referring to the _Canadian Armed Forces_** (also known as **_the Canadian Forces_**):


the Canadian Armed Forces or the Canadian Forces (Normal first reference)
the Armed Forces or the Forces (Standard second reference to Canadian Forces)
U.S. forces
British forces
British and Canadian forces (lowercase for plural)

coalition forces (several countries; lowercase even when Canada is included)


**Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army**
Between 1968 and mid-2011, the Canadian Forces renamed its unified air, sea and land components. They became known as the Air Command, Maritime Command and Land Force Command respectively. In August 2011, however, the federal government officially restored the old designations (the **Royal Canadian Air Force**, the **Royal Canadian Navy** and the **Canadian Army**). This did not require legislative amendment since the 1968 Canadian Forces Reorganization Act was unaffected by the change.

When specifying the air, sea or land branches of the Canadian Forces, **generally use the full, proper noun in first reference:**

Royal Canadian Air Force
Royal Canadian Navy
Canadian Army

**In second reference, these normally become:**

**air force** (lowercase) or **RCAF**
**navy** (lowercase; RCN is normally too obscure)
**army** (lowercase)

NOTE: There's normally no need to specify the old nouns (Air Command, Maritime Command and Land Force Command) for historical references between 1968 and 2011. Instead, it's an accepted convention to use air force, navy and army. More detail is usually needed only when directly relevant to the story (e.g., "Johnson says that when he joined the air force in 1975, some pilots continued to use the word "royal" and the letters "RCAF").


**army, navy, air force (lowercase)**
**When reporting on other countries' military branches, almost always keep broad categories such as army, navy and air force lowercase.** Many do not use these nouns in the proper names of their armed forces.

For consistency, we do not use capital letters simply because a country is mentioned. (Write the _Russian army_ or _Russia's army_, not the Russian Army.) **But in the case of Britain, use Royal Navy** (uppercase) **and Royal Air Force** (uppercase) **in first reference** since they're historically treated as proper nouns:

Canada's air force (versus "Royal Canadian Air Force" listed above)
air force jet
army spokesperson
North Korea's navy
Israeli army
**British navy, Britain's navy,** _but_ **the Royal Navy** (proper name)
**British air force, Britain's air force,** _but_ **the Royal Air Force** (proper name)
**U.S. air force, American air force** _but_ **U.S. 11th Air Force** (a proper noun)
British army
U.S. army


**Army, Fleet, etc. (uppercase)**
**Use uppercase when referring to the full, specific name of a military or paramilitary formation:**

7th Army Reserve Command
British 21st Army
Chinese 27th Army
U.S. 7th Fleet (specific group)
U.S. Pacific Fleet (specific formation)
but the U.S. fleet (entire navy)
2nd Field Artillery Regiment
French Foreign Legion
Canadian Coast Guard
U.S. National Guard

_Capital letters are also used for official sites_, such as bases or command headquarters (Canadian Forces Base Petawawa, CFB Petawawa), **ships** ([HMCS](/home/h/hmcs) Athabaskan), **official names of units and commands** (Pacific Fleet, 5th Battalion, 76th Infantry Brigade, 42 Squadron, C Company) **recognized nicknames** ([Van Doos](/home/v#vanDoos), Green Berets), **major conflicts** (French Revolution, Battle of Britain, Six-Day War) **and important positions in combat** (Western Front).

**
Ordinal numbers (10 versus 10th)**
**Some proper nouns include ordinal numbers. Others do not.** Don't assume. Check.

1 Royal Canadian Horse Artillery
2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment
10 Tactical Air Group
48th Highlanders of Canada

**There are several options for second references, including:**

the 2nd Battalion; the battalion
the 22nd Regiment; the 22nd; the regiment
10 Tactical; the air group
**
Prefer English versions of names established by convention:
**
3rd Battalion (rather than _3e Bataillon_)
Royal 22nd Regiment (rather than _Royal 22e Regiment_)

See also [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#retain) for related guidelines (e.g., prefer University of Montreal over Université de Montréal).

**Units within larger military groups can be linked by prepositions or commas.** Choose whichever format works best to make a sentence clear:

He was a member of the 24 Field Engineer Squadron, 2 Combat Engineer Regiment, serving with the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment.

Last year, she joined the 3rd Battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment, based at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier near Quebec City.

**Military police**
**Keep "military police" lowercase unless the words are being used as part of the full, formal name of a unit:**

They attacked a military police convoy.
Military police have launched a search for a missing cadet.
He's a member of the 18th U.S. Military Police Brigade.
The 720th U.S. Military Police Battalion heads to Iraq next month.

### Military ranks

**Military ranks**

**TV TEXT REMINDER:** Be aware that television graphics, banners, supers, etc., have some unique typographical conventions. The biggest difference is the use of more initial capital letters in titles, job descriptions, etc. (e.g., "Former Prime Minister" instead of former prime minister, and "High School Principal" instead of high school principal). See the [**TV Text overview**](/home/t/tv_text) for details.


[Abbreviations](/home/m/military-ranks#Abbreviations) (Brig.-Gen. versus brigadier-general)
[List of ranks](/home/m/military-ranks#List-Canada) (army, air force, navy)




[Canadian Armed Forces](/home/m/military-ranks#CAF) (the Armed Forces, the Forces)


**Abbreviations** (Brig.-Gen. versus brigadier-general)
**Use abbreviations only (a) before names and (b) if the rank is currently held. The short forms are always capitalized:**

> Capt. John Stone
>
> Brig.-Gen. Betty MacKay


This **applies to the Salvation Army as well** (e.g., Maj. Dusty Rhodes).
**In second reference, the abbreviated rank is optional but generally preferred.** Keep the best interests of readers in mind. Although surnames are sufficient, it's often helpful to remind people who someone is. Repeating ranks can aid identification, especially in long stories:

> Capt. Stone (preferred second reference in a military story, brief or long)
>
> Rhodes (acceptable second reference in a short Salvation Army story)


**Some ranks have no abbreviations. They're written in full.** The first letter is capitalized unless the position is no longer held:

> Admiral Jim Smith
>
> Vice-Admiral Harold

**
**Write out ranks or titles when used without names:****

> The lieutenant-colonel signed the documents.
>
> The general talked to reporters.


**When military personnel die while still in active service, their ranks are conventionally retained** before their names:

> Maj. Jane Jones was killed in the explosion.

\*\* = **The ranks of captain and lieutenant are higher in the navy than in the army and air force. To acknowledge this, we and most other Canadian news organizations, including CP, spell out the word "navy" (lowercase) before the abbreviation** (e.g., "**navy Capt. Ruth Oikawa**"). By contrast, the CAF adds a capital N in brackets after the naval rank to mark the distinction. We think our approach conveys the same detail more conversationally in broadcast scripts. It also avoids needless audience confusion about what the "N" stands for in web stories or TV supers.

\*^ = SAILOR replaces 'SEAMAN.' The Royal Canadian Navy's former ranks of ordinary seaman, able seaman, leading seaman and master seaman were changed in August 2020 to the gender-neutral alternatives of sailor third class, sailor second class, sailor first class and master sailor, respectively.

**Lt. instead of Lieut.**
While the word lieutenant has two acceptable abbreviations, CBC News abandoned use of "Lieut." in the fall of 2007. Our new style is simpler and equally valid: **Always use Lt. for the abbreviation Lieutenant in ranks before names** (Lt. Martin Martel and Lt.-Col. Ann Atwood). The old preference was to reserve Lt. for compound ranks such as Lt.-Gen. CP took a similar step around the same time, but has continued to use "Lieut." in some cases. We, however, do not.

**The Armed Forces uses its own system for abbreviations** (LCol for Lt.-Col, CPO for Chief Petty Officer, etc.), but the typography is idiosyncratic. **For consistency, we follow CBC guidelines on periods and capital letters.** These reflect standard newsroom publishing conventions.

 For phonetic preferences, including an ["f" sound in lieutenant](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D35060&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0bx5don-5st3Ogst__FMl4), see the [CBC Pronunciation Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XFPfiGVRPwO63-NkaNyUm).

See also [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix) (as a suffix)


**Commissioned vs. non-commissioned**
**It's rarely necessary to distinguish between commissioned and non-commissioned military personnel.** For starters, the modifier "commissioned" is not meaningful to most of our audience. In this context, a commission refers to a legal document from the Crown that formally specifies an individual's rank and duties. To complicate matters, there are two types of non-commissioned officers. Some are called "warrant officers" because their ranks are actually conferred through a warrant — another type of legal document that's occasionally dubbed a lower-grade commission. In most stories, this level of detail is unnecessary.

It's **usually sufficient to specify a rank** from the [tables above](/home/m/military-ranks#List-Canada) (e.g., Maj. Jane Smith and Petty Officer 2nd Class John Jones) **and, when relevant, briefly describe a person's role** (e.g., fighter pilot, mechanic, soldier, records clerk).

**Two common mistakes:
**

> **1\. Avoid wrongly implying that non-commissioned members carry out only junior duties or administrative work.** Non-commissioned officers, for example, may well have leadership roles (e.g., as corporals and sergeants). And many other non-commissioned members can perform a wide range of jobs, from operating artillery and other combat weapons to conducting peacekeeping missions. One Defence Department manual puts it this way:

> > _"Warrant officers and non-commissioned officers are frequently called ‘the backbone of the Forces.’ Their role is to translate the intentions of commanders into action and they are the link connecting the sailors, airmen and soldiers to their officers."_

> **2\. Avoid confusing a given person's job title and rank.** Ranks are positions within a military's hierarchy. Appointments, by contrast, are specific assigned duties (e.g., to be a quartermaster sergeant in charge of regiment's supplies). For instance, a person might be informally referred to as a "sergeant" when they're actually a master warrant officer (rank) assigned the duties of a quartermaster sergeant (duties). Calling that individual a sergeant in our story would technically be inaccurate because the non-commissioned member does not actually hold the rank of sergeant.


**If you have any doubts about people's ranks or primary roles in the military, ask them.** If that's not possible, or if you're still unsure, contact a Canadian Forces spokesperson.

**Former, retired, etc.**
**Former titles are always lowercase.** When people retire, their ranks are normally included in stories only when relevant and, even then, usually as background information after the name unless the person is well known and the rank is central to the story:

> Cheng, who was a second lieutenant in the Canadian Forces, said ...
>
> They met with retired general John de Chastelain to discuss ...


**In rare cases, disgraced personnel lose their rank** and the wording should make this clear:

> Convicted murderer Russell Williams had been a colonel for less than a year. He was stripped of his commission ...


**Other countries and eras**
**Here is an alphabetical list of additional ranks used by some other countries** (as well as some old terms that still crop up from time to time in our stories). The main sources are The Canadian Press, The Associated Press and the New York Times:

 technical sergeant

 Tech. Sgt.

 wing commander

  Wing Cmdr.


\* These three ranks are exceptions. In first reference, do not use them before names. Do not capitalize them. Instead, place them after names and include an explanation (e.g., Merry Brandybuck, _the master chief petty officer of the U.S. navy_, Sam Gamgee, t_he sergeant major of the U.S. army_, and Peter Pan, _the chief master sergeant of the U.S. air force_). Only one person holds these positions at any given time. They are the highest-ranking enlisted members of each service. In second reference, write _Master Chief_ Brandybuck, _Sgt. Maj._ Gamgee, _Chief Master Sgt._ Pan.

◊ In the U.S. military, the rank of specialist falls between private and corporal. It suggests extra technical rather than combat skills. Avoid the abbreviation Spc., which is unfamiliar to most Canadian readers. Instead, write out the full rank when it appears directly before a person's name (_Specialist Sam Gamgee_).

**Canadian Armed Forces** (the Armed Forces, the Forces)
The **Canadian Armed Forces** and the **Canadian Forces** are equally acceptable in first reference. In second reference, the **Armed Forces** and **the Forces** are both OK. The generic terms **army, navy** and **air force** do not have capital letters on their own, even when referring to Canadian military personnel (e.g., _The navy hopes to buy more submarines, The U.S. army has launched a new recruitment drive_). When specifying the air, sea and land branches of the Canadian Forces, use capital letters in first reference to the full, proper noun: the **Royal Canadian Air Force**, the **Royal Canadian Navy**, the **Canadian Army**. See also [military forces](/home/m/military-forces) for more guidelines on specific nouns, such as Royal 22nd Regiment instead of Royal 22e Regiment.

### Military terms overview

**Military terms | An overview**

**As with all of our journalism, stories about the military must be:**

-   **Accurate** (an artillery "shell" is the projectile launched not the casing)
-   **Clear** (dead or wounded civilians, not "collateral damage")
-   **Neutral** ("precision-guided," not "smart" bomb)

**A consistent in-house style** ("Lt." not "Lieut." or "Ltn.") **is also important** to maintain a level of professionalism expected of a national news service. **At the CBC, this includes using Canadian preferences** ("half-mast" rather than "half-staff").

**The Language Guide offers direction on various military words, expressions and abbreviations.** To make finding content easier, **the most frequently consulted terms have been compiled on this page** under the following general categories:

[Ceremonies and salutes](/home/m/military-terms-overview#ceremonies) (guard of honour, half-mast, ramp ceremony, etc.)
[Names of forces and personnel](/home/m/military-terms-overview#forces) (army but Canadian Armed Forces, etc.)
[Ranks](/home/m/military-terms-overview#ranks) (Pte., Sgt., Lt.-Col., etc.)
[Weapons, equipment, machinery, vessels, etc.](/home/m/military-terms-overview#weapons) (armada, artillery, guns, HMCS, mortars, rifles, etc.)
[Miscellaneous](/home/m/military-terms-overview#miscellaneous) (AWOL, dismissed with disgrace, embedded, friendly fire, etc.)

In many cases, links to longer entries are included.

The [Deciding what is clear](/home/m/military-terms-overview#deciding) section at the bottom provides general direction on dealing with new military terms and evolving language.

 For preferred phonetics, such as including an ["f" sound in lieutenant](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D35060&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0bx5don-5st3Ogst__FMl4) and rhyming the second half of [missile](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D28354&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3BFc0cILu04uP08VOevtKL) with "file" rather than "fill," see the [CBC Pronunciation Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1XFPfiGVRPwO63-NkaNyUm).




**Ceremonies and salutes**
[guard of honour](/home/g/guard-of-honour) (not honour guard)
dignitaries **inspect** a guard (in the U.S., they "review" it)
[half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) (not half-staff)
[Last Post](/home/l/last-post) (not _Taps_)

**Names of forces and personnel**

-   members of the **army** are called **soldiers**; members of the **navy** are called **sailors**; members of the **air force** are called **air personnel** (preferred over "airmen" and "airwomen")
-   the **Canadian Armed Forces** or the **Canadian Forces** in first reference, with the **Armed Forces** and **the Forces** both OK in second reference; but the **U.S. forces**, the **British forces**, and **coalition forces**, etc. (lowercase for generic foreign references)
-   the **Royal Canadian Air Force**, the **Royal Canadian Navy** and the **Canadian Army** when using the full, formal names of the air, sea and land branches of the Canadian Forces
-   the **Chinese 27th Army** (capital letters for specific divisions, foreign or domestic); but **Israel's army**, the U.S. navy, etc. (lowercase for general descriptions)
-   [Van Doos](/home/v#vanDoos) or Royal 22nd Regiment rather than Royal 22e Régiment


See the [military forces overview](/home/m/military-forces) for more details and examples, including a caution against using troop as a synonym for the singular word "soldier."

**Ranks**
**Some ranks have no abbreviations** (e.g., **Admiral Lewis Garner**). **Others are abbreviated only when directly in front of the person's name** (**Lt. Gillian Poole** versus "The **lieutenant** said she was told about the accident around noon").

**In web journalism, we follow a conventional publishing style for ranks.** This includes **using periods** (e.g., **Lt.-Col.** not "Lt-Col"), **adopting standard shorthand** before names (**Sgt.** rather than "Srgt." or "Srg" or any other variation of "sergeant," and **Pte.** rather than "Pvt." or "Pv." or any other variation of "private"), and **reserving capital letters for currently held titles** (e.g., **Gen. Pierre Fournier** versus "retired general John de Chastelain").
**The style for TV supers** (text superimposed over clips and images) **can be slightly different**, depending on what's most effective for the viewer (e.g., more initial capital letters tend to be used in TV supers, such as "Retired Gen. John de Chastelain"). **For the most part, however, the same style applies** (e.g., Col. Jane Dyson, Lt.-Col. Salima Habib and Pte. Anne Gray).

For [**a complete list of ranks for the army, air force and navy**](/home/m/military-ranks) used by CBC News, see the [**military ranks overview**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-ranks/ "Military ranks").


> Note: Military forces often have their own internal rules for abbreviations. These are merely in-house style preferences and should not be misinterpreted as the only correct forms. Indeed, such abbreviations tend to be inconsistent across different branches of the same country's military, with letters or punctuation added or dropped. For this reason, the CBC has its own set of guidelines for ranks based on media publishing conventions. Our abbreviations closely match those used by CP, AP and several other major news organizations.

**Weapons, equipment, machinery, vessels, etc.**

-   **armada** refers to warships
-   **[assault rifle](/home/w/weapons#assault_rifle)** is usually better than a specific but obscure name or model; if you do use a name or model, be certain it's the correct one (e.g., an **M-14** versus an **M-16** and an **AK-47** versus an **AK-74**)
-   Distinguish between **military firearms** (fully automatic) and [military-style firearms](/home/w/weapons)
-   **flak** (anti-aircraft fire) is clearly not the same as "flack" (a promoter)
-   **frigates, destroyers**, etc., are **[ships](/home/b/boat-versus-ship)** not boats; but submarines are technically boats
-   [**HMCS**](/home/h/hmcs), HMCS Protecteur (never "the" HMCS)
-   [**IED**](/home/i#IED) (improvised explosive device)
-   **MiG-25** (not MIG-25; see [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names) for general guidelines)
-   **precision-guided** or **laser-guided** (not "smart") **bomb**, missile or other weapon
-   A **sortie** is a single mission by one plane. When the air force reports, say, "600 sorties flown in less than four days," it's impossible to know how many planes or pilots were actually involved unless additional information is obtained.
-   [**tanks**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/w/weapons/#military "Weapons") should be identified by name (e.g., Challenger 2, Leopard 2) when specific detail is relevant to a given story.
-   A **volley** (virtually simultaneous shots from several weapons) is not the same as a **fusillade** (a sequence of shots fired from one weapon). The concentrated discharge of weapons in battle or salute is known as a salvo. Artillery fires in salvos.

See the [weapons overview](/home/w/weapons) for details about artillery, rifles, guns, missiles, mortars, etc.

**Miscellaneous**

-   **AWOL** (OK) For many years, the Canadian term for being **absent without leave** was AWL. But AWOL has become much more common and is now generally preferred in everyday speech because it's an [acronym](/home/a/acronyms) — i.e., an abbreviation that can be spoken as a word.
-   **basic military training** (_not_ "boot camp," which is preferred in the U.S.)
-   **collateral damage** (**AVOID**) Use dead or wounded civilians collateral damage, instead.
-   **dismissed** or **dismissed with disgrace** (OK, depending on the military ruling, but **NOT "dishonourably discharged,"** which is an American term) A court martial must be convened before Canadian military personnel can be dismissed with disgrace. But they can still be kicked out of the Armed Forces and lose their rank (be stripped of their commission) if a court martial is either not possible or deemed unnecessary. In these cases, the word "dismissed" is technically inaccurate and should be avoided. Instead, the person is said to be "released" from the military, although less-bureaucratic expressions such as "forced out" or "removed" are also fine.
-   **embedded** (OK) A common term to describe journalists and other civilians travelling and living with military forces in a combat zone. Although initially resisted by some news editors because it appeared to suggest that members of the media were "in bed" with a particular country's military, the word simply means "to be within a larger group." Embedded has become a clear and convenient way to refer to civilians who are first-hand witnesses but who are not independently deciding where and when to travel in the region.
-   **friendly fire** (Generally **AVOID** this jargon) If military forces accidentally injure or kill their own troops, prefer direct language rather than a euphemism.
-   **Geneva Conventions** (Almost always plural) Use the singular form only when referring to one of the four international treaties, such as "the Second Geneva Convention.")
-   **incursion** (OK when facts apply) An acceptable term for a brief raid or assault, especially along a border. An incursion normally implies a quick withdrawal. By contrast, an _invasion_ suggests something longer term, which may include _occupation_. These difference often become apparent only after enough time has past, which can make historical references to a specific ground operation different from initial coverage. 
-   **invasion** (**Requires caution**) The word not only implies a foreign-led force moving into another country or sovereign territory but also evidence of widespread resistance. This introduces two editorial considerations: Is the area disputed territory, and are local residents and/or military personnel fighting back? Military action by Russia against Ukraine illustrates conventional usage. In 2014, Russia annexed [Crimea](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/crimea/ "Crimea") and began what most of the world community considered an unlawful occupation of the peninsula. There was, however, virtually no documented resistance, which meant that the noun "invasion" was considered misleading because it strongly implied military battles during the takeover. By contrast, Russia launched an all-out invasion against Ukraine in February 2022. See [war](#war) below for related guidelines.
-   **lethal aid** (Generally **AVOID** unless attributed and defined) **Prefer clearer, more meaningful wording**, whether generic (**military weapons**) or specific (**guns, tanks, bombs**). While it's important to be accurate (e.g., differentiating between providing another country with troops versus providing, say, only weapons or only ammunition), "lethal aid" is perceived by many as highly euphemistic. By contrast, the expression "**non-lethal aid**" is **OK** if defined/explained because "non-military aid" is often inaccurate. **But never forget that unambiguous language is better** when specific facts are known (e.g., food, communications equipment, body armour, training).
-   **military campaign** (**_not_ "crusade,"** which is historically linked to church-backed religious fighting, especially the famous Christian Crusades)
-   **Molotov cocktail** (OK) Coined in the 1940s to describe handmade explosives that Finnish fighters threw at Russian tanks, the colloquial term has become entrenched in English and, so, **generally does not need to be defined in stories**. Molotov cocktail refers to any improvised explosive device made out of a bottle or other breakable container, a flammable liquid and something like a rag as a fuse. Synonyms include gasoline bomb, bottle bomb, fire bomb and homemade grenade.
-   **_Rouse_** (not "_Reveille_") Historically, _Rouse_ was the bugle call Commonwealth forces played to get their troops up in the morning. It is now sometimes played after the _Last Post_ at memorial ceremonies.
-   **war** (broad term to describe ongoing hostilities) The word can mean fighting between sovereign countries (often across disputed borders), or between different groups within the same country (conventionally called a **civil war** if the battles are between political factions, religious or ethnic communities, etc.). Sometimes more than one preposition can apply. For instance, **Russia's war against Ukraine** launched in February of 2022 also quickly became known as **the war in Ukraine**, since virtually all of the fighting took place there. The conflict could also accurately be called **Russia's invasion of Ukraine**, given the indisputable fact that it started with a Moscow-led attack. See also [invasion](#invasion) above for related caveat.
-   **women and children** (**AVOID as a synonym for civilians** outside of direct attribution) The outmoded phrasing was once common in various UN declarations on the protection of people not considered combatants in armed conflicts. However, women now serve in the military forces of many countries. **Specific detail about unarmed citizens remains OK in stories**, and can often be a meaningful way to convey the indiscriminating brutality of war (e.g., "including hundreds of civilians" and "including children and elderly residents").

**Deciding what is clear**
**Since language evolves, what begins as jargon to be avoided** (or, at the very least, defined each time) **sometimes winds up part of everyday speech.** Parents have been heard to describe their truant teens as "AWOL." We get flak from critics. A glitch is labelled a "snafu" by people who may not know or care that the original military acronym stood for "situation normal, all f--ked up."

In more recent years, "ramp ceremony" has entered the lexicon. It means a tribute paid by troops to a fallen comrade whose casket is being loaded on a plane for a final trip home. Originally, a number of journalists refused to use the term because of justifiable concerns that its meaning was unclear. Today, however, ramp ceremony is much more widely known and is OK in news coverage without explanation as long as the story's context makes the meaning clear.

How do we know what's OK for routine news reporting? HQ for headquarters is obvious and convenient. But "hooch" and "haybox" are just slang (for an improvised shelter and an insulated rations container, respectively). **When embracing or rejecting military vernacular, use common sense. Is the wording muddy or awkward or otherwise poor? Is there a better option? Always keep our audience in mind.**

### mines

**Mines**

**The word "mine" is almost always treated as a generic term and kept lowercase.**

> Barrick's **Lagunas Norte mine** in Peru.
>
> The old **Jericho mine** in Nunavut.
>
> The **Mount Polley mine** in B.C.


In this sense, "mine" is similar to "factory" or "warehouse" (e.g., the Heinz **ketchup factory**).

Any detail added before the word "mine" (e.g., "gold" or "open-pit") should also be kept lowercase:

> Barrick's Lagunas Norte **gold mine** in Peru is …
>
> The old Jericho **diamond mine** in Nunavut hasn't been …
>
> The Mount Polley **copper and gold mine** in B.C. will soon …


**Capitalize "mine" or related words (e.g., "mining") only when they're officially part of a proper noun**, such as organization's formal name or a book title:

> the **Mining** Association of British Columbia wants ...
>
> the Canadian **Mining** Innovation Council says ...
>
> Buffalo Bill's Diamond **_Mine_** was published in ...


See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) (an overview)

### Ministry

**Ministry**

**Capitalize federal and provincial government ministries, even if the name has been shortened:**

> Ministry of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
>
> Ministry of Crown-Indigenous Relations
>
> Crown-Indigenous Affairs Ministry
>
> Ministry of Northern Affairs
>
> Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans
>
> Finance Ministry

**
The words "department" and "ministry" are conventionally used as synonyms** in this context:

> Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
>
> Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations
>
> Crown-Indigenous Relations Department
>
> Department of Northern Affairs
>
> Department of Fisheries and Oceans
>
> Finance Department


See also [Department versus department](/home/d/department)
**When a government department is known by more than one name, generally prefer what's known as the "applied title,"** which reflects the government's current preference and is normally featured in public documents, on official websites, etc.


> Department of Industry (still the legal name, but no longer commonly used)
>
> Industry Canada (former "applied title" until late 2015)
>
> Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (new common, "applied title")


**Exceptions are entrenched names that remain clearer to our audience** than the new form (e.g., Foreign Affairs instead of Global Affairs, especially since the cabinet minister is still known as the minister of Foreign Affairs). A [**full list of legal names and applied names**](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/fip-pcim/reg-eng.asp) is kept up-to-date by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.

**It's sometimes acceptable to clip or slightly recast a ministry's name** to emphasize what's most relevant to a given story:

> Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada
>
> Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration
>
> Ministry of Immigration and Refugees
>
> Ministry of Citizenship


**But retain (or add) key detail to avoid confusion.** For instance, since the fall of 2015, the Department of Industry (which had commonly been called "Industry Canada") has been known as Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. The department is overseen by two different cabinet members, including a science minister:

> Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada
>
> Ministry of Economic Development (refers to one of the cabinet portfolios)
>
> Ministry of Science (refers to the same department but identifies a different minister)


**If a ministry's name** (full or shortened) **is used as a stand-alone _noun_, keep it capitalized.**

> Staff cuts were made at Defence and Indigenous Affairs.
>
> She moved from Health to Finance.
>
> He started in Foreign Affairs in 1993.
>
> She took over Fisheries and Oceans six months later.
>
> Flaherty ran the Finance Department for eight years.


**If it's an _adjective_, make it lowercase unless the full name is used:**

> A defence spokesperson denied the report.
>
> The health budget might increase.
>
> A finance official said ... (The proper name is Department of Finance Canada)
>
> Several veterans affairs workers ... (The proper name is Veterans Affairs Canada)
>
> A health department memo ...
>
> A Health Canada probe turned up no evidence. (Capital letters because the ministry's official name used)


This style also applies to the names of other government agencies, regulatory bodies, independent offices, etc.

**Generally avoid departmental abbreviations, even in web headlines, unless they're well known** (e.g., DND is OK for Department of National Defence but FOC is too obscure to be effective for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, especially since the ministry's official name remains the [Department of Fisheries and Oceans](/home/f/fisheries-and-oceans)). **Bear in mind that some initially obscure abbreviations can gain common currency over time, such as CRA** for the [Canada Revenue Agency](/home/c/canada-revenue-agency), which used to be called Revenue Canada.

**Although the federal Treasury Board is actually a special cabinet committee, it's conventionally treated in the same way as any ministry. Retain the initial capital letters even in adjectival constructions, since this is the full name:**

> Treasury Board President Stockwell Day
>
> Day, who became president of the Treasury Board in January ...
>
> a Treasury Board official ...
>
> She works at the Treasury Board.


**If a ministry's name is part of a person's current title, capitalize only when that title is _directly before_ the person's name:**

> Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq
>
> Aglukkaq, Canada's health minister ...
>
> Raj Opus, the minister of community and cultural affairs ...
>
> Takasaki, who served as minister of transportation and public works ...
>
> Hnatyshyn, a former justice minister ...


**This applies to junior cabinet members as well:**

> Minister of State for Sport Gary Lunn
>
> Minister of State for the Status of Women Helena Guergis


**Since some titles are long, recasting often helps make sentences easier to scan. Depending on the rewrite, lowercase letters may be required:**

> Sports Minister Gary Lunn
>
> junior cabinet minister Helena Guergis
>
> Helena Guergis, the minister of state for the status of women


See also [titles](/home/t/titles) for related guidelines

**Capitalize foreign government ministries, even when they're English translations:**

> the British Defence Ministry
>
> the French Foreign Ministry
>
> Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry
>
> the Russian Interior Ministry


Be sure to use [Canadian spellings for American departments](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre), such as Defence and Labour.

### dilemma

**Misinformation**

Refers to **false or misleading information** that could be mistaken as factual. **Misinformation is a broad label** coined more than 400 years ago that **can include honest mistakes, misunderstandings, intentional or unintentional exaggerations, conspiracy theories, nonsensical fallacies, orchestrated deceit, etc.**

When incorrect information is spread on purpose, it's sometimes called disinformation. The key difference: **Misinformation can be unintentional**. By contrast, **[disinformation](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/#disinformation "D") inherently implies that falsehoods are repeated on purpose**. For this reason, it's crucial to be precise in our language, and make sure that any suggestion of intent is supported by fact.

The word lie conventionally means an intent to deceive. **Just because someone is repeating falsehoods does not automatically mean they are "lying."** Bear in mind that it can be difficult, if not impossible, to objectively determine the motive behind someone repeating a falsehood. Be aware, too, **there can be legal consideration when accusations of deception are levelled** against an individual.

**Fabricated claims, political propaganda, hoaxes, etc., all fall into the category of misinformation** (e.g., if they're unwittingly repeated on social media) **AS WELL AS into the category of disinformation** when the aim to deceive is indisputable.

Since around 2015, **the colloquial term **fake news** has become a common synonym for misinformation**. Because the label remains closely associated with sweeping criticism of mainstream media outlets by certain politicians and their supporters, **however, misinformation is often a better choice than "fake news"** outside of direct attribution.

When covering any form of misinformation, **be specific about what's considered misleading or erroneous and why. Cite sources whenever practical** when fact-checking. If something is ambiguous or open to interpretation, make this clear. **Avoid amplifying the original misinformation** (e.g., by repeating inaccuracies or out-of-context detail in a way that could be misheard or misread as validation).

### Money

**Money**

[Lowercase names](/home/m/money#lowercasenames) (from dollars to bitcoins)









**Lowercase names (from dollars to bitcoins)**
Keep the names of currencies lowercase (dollars, pounds, yen, kronor), even when they're based on a proper noun element (e.g., euros from Europe). This applies to cryptocurrencies, such as [bitcoin](/home/b#bitcoin), virtual money, such as various online gaming credits, and promotional coupons and store vouchers (25 cents in Canadian Tire money).


**Generally prefer Canadian dollars**
**Unless there's a strong editorial reason to refer to a foreign currency, report virtually all monetary amounts in Canadian dollars.** The four most common exceptions:

-   When a story focuses on the United States, it's often easiest to present all figures in U.S. dollars. See [conversions](/home/m/money#conversions) for more details and examples.
-   When the converted currency is volatile or the original amount is extremely large (e.g., a country's debt), it's often clearest to present the figures in the original unit first (e.g., euros) with a conversion to Canadian dollars in brackets whenever practical (e.g., adding the $ conversion in the main body of a web story but sticking with € in the headline). See [pounds (£) and euros (€)](/home/m/money#others) for more details.
-   When the currency, itself, is part of the story's focus (e.g., a feature on bitcoins or a background piece on euros)
-   When we want to add colour to a feature by specifying a local currency (e.g., a young child polishing a 10-kwacha coin she bought from a tourism shop in Zambia).

**The best interests of our audience should always be served.** Since it's unrealistic to expect our viewers, listeners or online readers to know how much a Polish zloty or a Latvian lat is worth, **conversion to Canadian dollars normally provides the most meaningful detail.**


**Use figures: $7, $60,000, $1 million**
_In online journalism, use figures_ not words like "thousand" or "hundred thousand" **for amounts up to $999,999** that include currency symbols. Avoid broadcast constructions full of hyphens, such as _one-hundred-and-thirty-five-thousand dollars_:

> _$7_
>
> _$123.50_
>
> _$60,000_
>
> _$135,000_
>
> _$1 million_
>
> _$12 billion_


**When a currency symbol** such as $ or € **is not used, spell out figures below 10:**

> _six million pesos_
>
> _seven billion euros or €7 billion_


**For dollar amounts, prefer $ sign because the constructions are easier to scan:**

> _$8 million (instead of eight million dollars)_ See [$ sign](/home/m/money#$sign) below for more details and examples.


**Do not use unfamiliar terms, such as "quintillion" or even "quadrillion."** Instead, write a million billion, a billion billion, etc., to make it clear to our audience what we're talking about.

**When reporting ranges involving large numbers** (million, billion, trillion), **repeat the unit in our web journalism to avoid any ambiguity** (e.g., while _$5 to $10 million_ could be easily interpreted as _"five dollars to ten million dollars," $5 million to $10 million_ is crystal clear):

> _$7 to $10_
>
> _$100,000 to $150,000_
>
> _$5 million to $10 million_
>
> _$20 billion to $30 billion_


**Money in headlines**
**In web headlines, thousand (K), million (M), billion (B) and trillion (T) can be abbreviated** when referring to money. There is no space between the the currency sign ($, €), the number and the uppercase letter:

> _$13K_
>
> _$175M_
>
> _€25B_
>
> _$3T_


**The $ implies Canadian currency** unless otherwise specified. **Sometimes, [U.S. currency](/home/m/money#CdnUS) is included in headlines**. In those rare cases, follow our standard style (US, no periods, after the figure):


> _$1.17 US_
>
> _$200 US_
>
> _$50M US_


**It's acceptable to abbreviate dollars, euros and pounds in headlines: $, € and £.** But avoid more obscure currency symbols, such as ¥ for yen and ₣ for franc. See [pounds (£), euros (€)](/home/m/money#others) below for more details. See also [numbers in headlines](/home/n/numbers#inheadlines) for related guidelines (e.g., "10 million people" _not_ "10M people").


**Limit hyphens to adjectives before nouns**
Some news organizations use hyphens in routine currency constructions to avoid any possible confusion (e.g., $100 million would always be reported as $100-million to avoid any possible misreading of the amount as "$100" during a quick scan). But this is not a standard publishing convention, is not the approach taken by The Canadian Press and is not the style at CBCNews.ca.

On the other hand, **hyphens help clearly convey financial amounts used adjectivally before nouns:**

> _$1 million but a $1-million project_
>
> _$5 million US but a $5-million US profit_ (no hyphen before "US")
>
> _$12 billion but a $12-billion bailout_


Keep in mind that **recasting sentences with figures after the noun is sometimes preferred:**

_a $5.5- to $6.5-million loss_ (hyphens needed)
_a loss of $5.5 million to $6.5 million_ (hyphens not required)

See the [overview on hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens) for related punctuation guidelines.


**The $ sign**
**Use figures next to the $ sign** (or other [acceptable currency symbols](/home/m/money#others) as outlined below), **even for numbers below 10:**

> _They printed one million tickets, which sold for $5 a piece._
>
> _The prize was $1 million._


**Generally use the currency sign** ($) **instead of writing out "dollar."** While small amounts are sometimes treated as exceptions, **keep in mind that words are not as easy to scan as symbols and figures:**

> _She gave him $1._
>
> _She gave him one dollar._ (OK based on convention, but not preferred)
>
> _He gave her $3._
>
> _He gave her three dollars._ (OK based on convention, but not preferred)


**Normally use the dollar sign** ($) **only when referring to Canadian or U.S. currency:**

> _$750 US_
>
> _$1,000 Cdn_ (see note on Cdn below)


**Conversions**
**Many countries call their monetary units "dollars,"** including Antigua, Australia, Fiji, Guyana, Hong Kong, Namibia, New Zealand and Tuvalu. But instead of writing "$120 million (Australian)," **we generally convert the figure into Canadian dollars** ("$117 million").

**The Bank of Canada's website features a handy [conversion tool](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankofcanada.ca%2Frates%2Fexchange%2Fdaily-converter%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2_uRPFCLKnykyVbawpRiXn). For consistency, use it rather than other sources when calculating currency values.**

**It's OK to express figures in U.S. dollars, if the story focuses on the United States** (e.g., the size of the U.S. defence budget). **U.S. dollars are also sometimes preferred for consistency if established as an industry standard** (e.g., commodities such as oil and gold are commonly traded in American dollars).

If there's a major difference between the value of the two currencies, adding one Canadian conversion in brackets after the first reference can be helpful to our audience. But it's not essential as long as U.S. currency values are clearly specified. See guidelines on the use of $ US below.


**Cdn, US (no periods)**
**In our news stories, Canadian dollars are normally implied. But if the context is not clear** (e.g., in stories that refer to different countries' currencies), **specify "Canadian." In web journalism, this means adding the abbreviation "Cdn"** after the figure. **Indicate American dollars by putting "US" after the figure:**

> _The committee wants an additional $54 million US put into the project by February._
>
> _She deposited $475 US into her account. She got $633, but had to pay a $10 Cdn service fee._


**Do not include periods in Cdn or US when identifying the country's money, except at the end of a sentence:**

> _The airfare cost $743 Cdn._
>
> _The airfare cost $743 Cdn once tax was added._
>
> _The company promises to spend $15 million US._
>
> _The company promises to spend $15 million US on the project._


**In adjectival constructions, do not include hyphens before the currency notation** (US or Cdn). Instead, treat these abbreviations as parenthetical additions that do not require extended punctuation:

> _She negotiated a $5-million US signing bonus._
>
> _They agreed to a $2-billion US investment over five years._


Be sure to include periods in "U.S." when referring to the geographical area or to the government rather than to the country's currency (see [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)). Never abbreviate Canada or Canadian outside of the currency designation "Cdn" noted above, even in headlines.


**Decimal points (1.50)**
**Use decimal points only if they're followed by more than just zeros** (e.g., $1.50 but never $1.00, $2.00, etc.)

**Generally round dollar figures to a maximum of two decimal points** (e.g., about $5.25 million instead of $5.2467 million), unless a more precise amount is essential for editorial reasons.


**Pounds (£), euros (€), yen, pesos, kronor, etc.**
**When a currency is volatile or if the original figures are extremely large** (e.g., a country's debt) and even slight fluctuations can be significant during a brief period, **it's often preferable to report the figure in the original currency first** — with the most up-to-date Canadian dollar conversions supplied in brackets.


> Example: During the spring of 2010, the European Union and International Monetary Fund agreed to provide Greece with a conditional €110-billion bailout. Given swings in the value of the euro, the conversion figure fluctuated by several million dollars over the course of a few months. The least confusing way to report on this story was to mention euros first (consistently using €110 billion), and then to supply Canadian dollar conversions in brackets (generally hovering between $146 billion and $148 billion, usually rounded to no more than two decimal places as required: $146.94 billion).


**Otherwise, generally don't bother mentioning pounds, euros, etc., unless transcribing a direct quote or publishing a story that is improved by references to local currency** (e.g., a travel piece that includes currency amounts as colourful detail).


> Example: If a Pakistan court imposes a 3,000-rupee fine, it's probably clearest to day "a fine of about $35" — Canadian dollars are already implied — rather than to confuse our audience by reporting "a 3,000-rupee fine" (which sounds large) only then to add a meaningful conversion in brackets ("about $36.50"). On the other hand, if the fine is extremely large (in the millions of dollars), the original currency figure followed by a Canadian dollar conversion may be preferred, especially if the figure is likely to be cited again because the story is ongoing. Use your judgment. And always keep in mind that context is helpful (e.g., a fine that seems small by North American standards may actually represent, say, a month's wages to the citizen who has to pay it). Providing relevant details like that elevates our journalism.
>
> Example: If renovations on a museum in Italy are going to cost 12 million euros, simply converting the figure into Canadian dollars is often the most effective way to report this detail. Unlike Greece's bailout story cited above, a museum renovation piece is probably not going to keep surfacing in the news. And the one-time conversion saves space, since the original euro figure needs to be expressed in Canadian dollars to be meaningful to a wide CBC News audience. Of course, if the renovation costs later soared and it became important to compare the original value to a new value, then providing the amounts in euros first would probably make the most sense in a followup story, especially if conversion rates had changed significantly as well. Use your discretion, keeping in mind the best interests of our audience.


**For the most part, we avoid foreign currency symbols** (e.g., ¥ for yen or ₣ for franc), **even in headlines.** Instead we either spell out the word or convert the amount to dollars (and use the $ symbol).

The only exceptions:

-   **The symbols for pound (£) and euro (€) are OK in headlines.**
-   **£ is also acceptable in the main body of a story**, although we’re not locked into using the symbol for the word "pound(s)" — just as there are times when we write out "dollar(s)" instead of using $. Be sure to use £ instead of ₤ (which stands for lira). The correct international banking code for the United Kingdom's currency unit is GBP (Great Britain pound) rather than UKP, although avoid using either abbreviation.
-   **€ can be used in the main text of an article, too, but make certain the context is clear** because the euro sign is still not as widely known as £. If, for example, a series of figures obviously refers to euros, € is fine. But if there's only one reference to a euro amount in the middle of a story, consider spelling out the word. Keep in mind that readers might either (i) not understand the meaning of €, or (ii) see the € as a $ during a quick scan of the article.

**When publishing foreign currency symbols, always put them flush and to the left of the figure** (e.g., £500,000), just as you would with the $ sign. See [money in headlines](/home/m/money#headlines) above for related guidelines.

Use CBC-approved publishing tools to add such special characters to stories, rather than raw HTML.

**When writing out foreign currency names, use lowercase lettering and place the name after the figure or spelled-out number:**

> _125,000 pounds_
>
> _15,000 euros_
>
> _15 million francs_
>
> _three billion pesos_
>
> _one trillion rubles_


**Be sure to pick the correct word. Plurals require special care** (lira becomes lire). So do certain terms, such as krona:

> _krona_ (singular), _kronur_ (plural) Icelandic

> _krona_ (singular), _kronor_ (plural) Swedish
>
> _krone_ (singular), _kroner_ (plural) Danish and Norwegian

**A note about euros**
Since Jan. 1, 2002, the euro has been used as a common currency in more than 10 European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece and Italy.

The names of some well-known monetary units — such as francs and lire — are still active in other parts of the world, however, so check which term applies to a specific place. (See also [pounds, euros, yen, pesos, kronor](/home/m/money#others) above for guidelines on the use of the € symbol.)

For more information, read the 2003 CBCNews.ca feature [Here Comes the Euro](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fbackground%2Feuro%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0Gn6l0VVzippNsukSHN13r)

**See also [numbers](/home/n/numbers)** (an overview), **which includes guidelines on when to write out figures (e.g., four million litres versus 10 houses).**

### more than versus over

**More than versus over**

**Some writers limit "over" to spatial relationships** (e.g., over the Atlantic Ocean, over the moon), **and prefer the expression "more than" when referring to something exceeding a specific number. But there's no grammatical or editorial reason to insist on this approach.** Either version is OK:

> More than 200 people showed up.
>
> Over 200 people showed up. 
>
> They travelled more than 500 kilometres.
>
> They travelled over 500 kilometres.


Indeed, numerous entrenched constructions feature "over" and specific figures:

> The actors are all over 30.
>
> They're hoping for bids over $1 million.


As Bill Bryson observed in his classic 1984 book, _The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words:_

> _**"The notion that 'over' is incorrect for 'more than' — as in 'over 300 people were present' — is a widely held superstition.** The stricture has been traced to Ambrose Bierce's Write It Right (1909), a usage book teeming with quirks and quiddities, most of which have since been discarded. **There is no harm in preferring 'more than,' but also no basis for insisting on it."**_


For this reason, CBC News does not prefer one construction over the other. Use whatever wording is the most natural/conversational to you in a given story.

### Mormon Mormonism

**Mormon, Mormonism:** **the** **Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**

**Periodic use of** the words **Mormon** and **Mormonism** is **OK in stories, including in headlines** where space is tight (e.g., **the Mormon Church**). But **include at least one complete reference to the religion's full name**, the **Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**, high up. **Whenever practical, the name should be spelled-out in first reference.** NOTE: The word **"day" is hyphenated and lowercase**.

**LDS is fine in occasional second reference** to the church (e.g., **LDS charities**, **LDS Church**) as long as the abbreviation's meaning is obvious from context. Other options include generic phrasing (e.g., **the church, church members**).

Be aware that many Canadians may not instantly recognize the name the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. **While the word Mormon provides key context** (e.g., "widely known as the Mormon Church") **exercise restraint**, given a shift in language within the religious community, itself. **The church began discouraging use of the colloquial name Mormon in 2018** (e.g., the "Mormon Tabernacle Choir" became **the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square**). LDS leaders prefer the church's full, formal name be used, and that church members call themselves "Latter-day Saints." **The deeply entrenched proper noun Mormon, however, remains common.**

There's no linguistic evidence that there's anything inherently pejorative about the word Mormon. Therefore, **we think our approach of permitting occasional use of a colloquial name balances respect for one group's preference** to use a lengthy proper noun **against the need for brevity and audience comprehension.**

**Mormons are not polygamists**
Founded in the U.S. in the 1830s, Mormonism is a Christian faith based in Salt Lake City, Utah. It reported a membership of roughly 16 million in 2020, including a large missionary service around the globe. In addition to the Bible, the central scripture is the **Book of Mormon**.

As with descriptions of any church in our journalism, **be cautious when summing up general beliefs, common practices**, etc. **Modern Mormonism, for example, has actively denounced polygamy for more than a century** — excommunicating those who practice it. By contrast, breakaway sects still espouse certain 19th century traditions, including polygamy.

**Never refer to members of the polygamist group the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints** (capital "D" in Day) **as Mormons or Mormon fundamentalists**, since this implies a direct relationship with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). **The polygamist group can accurately be called a splinter sect**. (See [cult versus sect](/home/c/cult-versus-sect))

### mulatto


**Mulatto**

**In general, avoid using the term "mulatto"** in news stories.**

Exceptions are when we're** (1) **quoting someone** who prefers to be known by this term, (2) **citing a literary passage**, or (3) **providing historical context** – e.g., referring to the wording of old legislation against interracial marriage.

There are two reasons:

-   Mulatto, based on the word "mule," offends many people and is considered as inappropriate as now-discarded terms such as "half-caste" (which means "half pure") and "half breed."


-   Old racial categories (e.g., mulatto, quadroon and octoroon) are dismissed by many experts as pseudo-scientific and misleading.

We're not the first news organization to adopt this stand. In its 1998 Style Book, for instance, the Globe and Mail warns: "We should not get into the game of measuring skin shade to declare that a person obviously of mixed race is either Caucasian or Black, nor should we use such specific terms as mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, or half-breed."

CBC journalists are reminded to avoid including a person's skin colour in stories unless this detail is deemed relevant.

Alternatives for "mulatto" include **biracial, multiracial**, or a specific description rather than a label. For example, in a child custody dispute largely based on race that was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001, we simply reported that the boy's mother was white and his father was Black.

For more background, see the 2002 Words: Woe & Wonder column, [Mulatto and Malignity](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fmulatto.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0WpoLrjtNWbzgt21Zd21-e).

### Myanmar

**Myanmar**

**Use Myanmar in headlines** (broadcast and web) **as well as in leads.**

In a subsequent reference, it's OK to add "**Myanmar, also known as Burma**" once if editorially sensible (e.g., when someone in a broadcast clip or transcribed web quote has referred to Burma). **For consistency, use Myanmar after that** — the country's official name.

The optional detail "also known as Burma" has become less important as the name Myanmar has gained wider recognition. Use your judgment. It's more easily inserted online than on air. In broadcast scripts, the extra words are sometimes too clunky to read naturally. In these cases, consider inserting the fact as a short sentence on its own ("Myanmar is also known as Burma") rather than as a fragment or clause.

Language: **Burmese** (citizens of Myanmar speak Burmese)

Noun: Either **Burmese** (traditional) or **Myanmarese** (increasingly common English form), as in "Four of the artists are Myanmarese"

Modifier: Either **Myanmar** (the Myanmar government) or **Myanmarese** (a group of Myanmarese writers)

NOTE: While some Burmese speakers reject the term "Myanmarese" as an anglicized corruption, the word has become entrenched in English. It conveys clear meaning ("of or related to Myanmar") succinctly.

Largest city and commercial centre: **Yangon** (previously referred to as "Rangoon")

Capital city: **Naypyitaw** (fused), previously spelled as "Naypyidaw"

**In web or TV maps, use Myanmar as the principal entry** for the country (e.g., in bold or larger type). **Burma can be added in brackets** and/or a smaller point size to provide context, **but this is optional.** Generally use only one name for cities and towns. For instance, when reporting on Yangon there's normally no reason to add "previously known as "Rangoon" unless that historical detail is relevant to a particular story.


**Background**
Burma gained its independence from Britain in 1948. **The names Myanmar and Burma were both widely used in the country, even after a coup in 1962. But in 1989, references to Burma were essentially outlawed** to try to quell a growing pro-democracy movement. Freelance journalist Swe Win put it this way in a July 2012 New York Times column: "Before this question of vocabulary got hijacked by politics, both names were used almost interchangeably in the Burmese language. It’s just that Myanmar had a more literary and ceremonial quality and Burma a more colloquial usage."

Military rulers declared that the names Myanmar (for the country) and Yangon (for the largest city) better reflected pre-colonial culture. They passed the Adaptation of Expression Law, requiring that all English names be aligned with Burmese pronunciation. Their decision was not approved by any of the country's democratically elected leaders, however, and **many foreign governments continued to use Burma for decades. So did most Western news organizations.**

While the generals also officially moved the capital to the remote jungle community of Naypyitaw in 2006, most foreign diplomatic missions remained in Yangon. For this reason, Naypyitaw is commonly described as the country's administrative capital.

**Governments around the world gradually began referring to the country as Myanmar** after a range of political reforms were adopted. **Canada officially embraced the proper noun in 2016**, after Myanmar's first democratically elected president in more than half a century was sworn into office. **The same year, CBC News style was updated to "Myanmar" alone in first reference** (replacing the wordier expression "Burma, also known as Myanmar," that had been preferred in coverage).

**nationalism** (strongly implies ideology of supremacy) Nationalism is at the heart of Nazi (a 1920s clipped form of _Nationalsozialistische_, which translates as "national socialist"). And that, in itself, conveys a great deal about why the word requires care. When originally used in the 1790s, "nationalism" simply meant love of country, especially in the context of self-determination and independence. But by the 1900s, the term's common definition had become "advocating the interests of one's own nation to the exclusion or detriment of others." For this reason, nationalism is distinct from **patriotism**, which means love of country without the pejorative sense of cultural or racial superiority. It's also not the same as **jingoism**, which describes a blend of blustering patriotism and bellicose foreign policy — often favouring military aggression abroad. The connection between nationalism and **[Nazism](/home/n#Nazi)** is well established. The term "[**white nationalism**](/home/w#white_nationalism)" is also entrenched as a racist ideology.

**National Library** (See [Library versus library](/home/l/library))

**National Organization for Women** (NOW)

**National Parole Board** (also known as the **Parole Board of Canada**). Either noun is OK, according to the federal government's [registry of applied titles](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tbs-sct.gc.ca%2Fpubs_pol%2Fsipubs%2Ftb_fip%2Ftitlesoffedorg1-eng.asp&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3BiwrC5rYk4YA5i6w2EsE8), in the same way that the Department of Health can also be called Health Canada. But keep **parole board** lowercase in second reference if the name is shortened.

**the National Post** (See also [the](/home/t/the-versus-the))

**National War Memorial** (Ottawa)

**nationwide** (no hyphen, as in countrywide) but use with caution (See [nation versus country](/home/n/nation-versus-country))

**Native people** (considered an archaic term in Canada; generally avoid) See [**Indigenous**](/home/i/Indigenous) for detailed guidelines

**NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)** Spell out at some point in longer stories focused on the group, but not if merely mentioned in a paragraph or two. (See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations))

**Natural Resources Defence Council** (_not_ "Defense," even though it's a U.S. environmental organization) See [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for related guidelines.

**Natuashish** (Labrador community relocated from Davis Inlet)

**nautical mile** (1.853 kilometres) A "**knot**" is the distance in nautical miles covered in an hour. Never write "knots an hour," which is redundant. Generally prefer measuring distances in metres or kilometres, even at sea. But see [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#nautical) for guidelines on when nautical mile is OK.

**Nav Canada** (A private company that provides air traffic control, flight information and other air navigation services in Canada.) When it was created in 1996, Nav Canada took over some responsibilities previously handled by Transport Canada. Instead of relying on government funding, Nav Canada charges airlines and other customers a fee. Do not put the organization's name in all uppercase letters ("NAV CANADA"). See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for general guidelines.

**navy, the Canadian navy, the U.S. navy, the British navy** _but_ the **Royal Navy** because it's a proper name (See [military forces](/home/m/military-forces), which includes details on 2011 name change back to **Royal Canadian Navy**)

**Naypyitaw** (Administrative capital of Myanmar, replacing the much larger commercial centre of Yangon in 2006.) See **[Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar)** for detailed guidelines.

**Nazi** (party supporter); **Nazism** (fascist ideology originally associated with the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, commonly called the **Nazi Party**, translated from "_Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei_"); **neo-Nazism** (post-WW II ideology of ultranationalism, racism, antisemitism, etc., in various places around the world) ; **Nazi Germany** (conventionally refers to Germany between 1933 and 1945, with Adolf Hitler as its chancellor). To distinguish Nazi Germany from modern-day Germany, the modifier "Nazi" should generally be used when referring to the country during this period, at least in first reference. The term **Nazi-occupied** refers to countries invaded by Hitler's armies (e.g., **Nazi-occupied France**, **Nazi-occupied Holland**, and **Nazi-occupied Poland**). Such descriptions are helpful because they place specific events in important historical context. **Avoid the expression "Nazi-occupied Germany,"** since Nazis were, themselves, Germans. Instead, prefer the shorter, entrenched label "Nazi Germany." Although historians agree that the Nazis rose to power through intimidation and abuse of the electoral process, it's misleading to characterize Hitler's dictatorship as an "occupation." Do not refer to **Auschwitz** or any of the other concentration camps in **occupied Poland** as "Polish." They were **Nazi extermination camps** or **Nazi death camps** built in Poland after Hitler's troops invaded. Even camps erected inside Germany (e.g., **Dachau**) are conventionally referred to as "Nazi" rather than as "German" camps. Adjectives such as "death" and "extermination" are considered appropriate, since these facilities were part of the mass murder of Jews, known as **the Holocaust**.

**ne-nn**

**Nebraska (Neb.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**necessaries** (archaic noun) Generally prefer the more common term **necessities**, unless referring specifically to the Criminal Code of Canada charge of failing to provide the "**necessaries of life**" (See [Canadian court terms](/home/c/canadian-court-terms) for details and related guidelines)

**Negro, Negroes** (archaic terms reserved for proper nouns, such as movie and book titles or the names of organizations like the United Negro College Fund) See [racial terms](/home/r/racial-terms)

****neighbour, neighbourhood****

**neither ... nor** (see [nor versus or](/home/n/nor-versus-or))

**neo (prefix)**
The prefix "neo" is generally followed by a hyphen when terms are new or relatively uncommon (e.g., neo-colonialism, neo-paganism). The punctuation is often dropped when terms become widely used (e.g., neoclassical, neonatal). But there are exceptions, based on entrenched usage (e.g., neo-Nazism).
**neo-Christian, neoclassical, neo-colonial, neo-conservative, neo-Darwinian, neo-fascist, neo-Gothic, neo-Georgian, neo-Latin, neo-liberal, neo-McCarthyism, neonatal, neophobic, neo-Nazi, neo-pagan, neo-pantheism, neo-realism
**
**NEP** (OK in second reference to **National Energy Program**) A controversial federal policy that affected the price, supply and tax revenue of domestic oil and gas production between 1980 and 1985. See [program](/home/p#program) for related capitalization guidelines.

**Nepal** (country), **Nepalese** (n. and adj.) Although Nepalese and Nepali are listed as synonyms in many dictionaries, including the Canadian Oxford, the former term is older and more entrenched. For consistency, therefore, we follow CP, AP and many other Western media in preferring Nepalese. It's a singular and plural noun (_1,000 Nepalese_), as well as an adjective (_Nepalese authorities_, the _Nepalese rupee_). Nepal's official language is commonly and acceptably referred to as **Nepali**.

**nerve-racking** (_not_ –wracking) See [rack versus wrack](/home/r/rack-versus-wrack)

**[Netherlands, the](/home/n/netherlands-versus-holland)** (Although Amsterdam is the official capital of the Netherlands, The Hague is the administrative capital and the seat of government. The country is _not_ called "Holland." North and South Holland are only two provinces.) See also [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the)

**Nevada (Nev.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**Nexus** (capitalize first letter only, as in a **Nexus card**) The Nexus program was launched in the fall of 2000 to let eligible, pre-screened travellers cross the Canada-U.S. border more quickly. Despite the typographical style of various government agencies, avoid rendering the proper noun in all caps ("NEXUS") because it's not an abbreviation. The name is based on the Latin term for "binding tie" or "secure connection" (_nexus_). See [capitalization](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/capitalization/ "Capitalization") for general guidelines,

**New Delhi** (capital city of India) New Delhi is one of several districts within the larger territory (state) of Delhi, which includes North Delhi, Central Delhi, West Delhi, and so forth. It's OK to use **Delhi** alone in stories if you mean the entire metropolitan area (e.g., when a major sports competition is held at venues across Delhi, such as the **Delhi Commonwealth Games** in 2010, also known as the **Delhi Games**). This is comparable to referring to the communities around Toronto as the GTA. But just as the capital of Ontario is Toronto (not the GTA), the capital of India is New Delhi (not Delhi).

**New York (N.Y.)** normally refers to the state, also known as **New York state** (lowercase "s"); **New York City** refers to the community, which is technically called "New York" too. (New York is OK in second reference to the city; **NYC** is fine in headlines) See [United States](/home/u/united-states) for general guidelines on U.S. city and state names. Although we usually put periods in [geographical abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) (e.g., N.W.T. and P.E.I.), we write NYC instead of "N.Y.C." for two reasons: The C isn't actually part of the municipality's official name, and dropping periods is a long-standing convention in this case (along the lines of the entrenched exception JFK instead of "J.F.K." for John Fitzgerald Kennedy, despite rules about almost always including periods after initials in people's names).

**[non-confidence vote](/home/n/non-confidence)** (_parliamentary term_) Prefer the prefix "non-" over "no-" in this context. The traditional wording ("no-confidence vote") has been gradually replaced in speech and writing.

**nondescript**

**non-disclosure** (adj.); **non-disclosure agreement** (also commonly called a **confidentiality agreement**) The abbreviation **NDA** is acceptable in headlines and second reference. But it should be spelled out at least once, high in stories. Such legal agreements can cover a wide range of topics, from trade secrets to details about a person's sex life. The colloquial compound [**hush money**](/home/h#hush_money) is generally OK in stories that convey the sense not only of secrecy but of suppression of scandal (e.g., to keep details of an extramarital affair private, or to silence allegations of sexual assault).

**[none is, none are](/home/n/none_is_are)** (plural versus singular)

**non-fiction** (n. and adj.)

**non-fungible token** (**NFT**) A digital artifact — from drawings and photographs to licensed music and video — identified as unique by sophisticated cyber technology that certifies its authenticity and ownership, which can be temporary or permanent. While NFT is fine in headlines, the abbreviation should generally be defined or explained at least once in stories, unless the meaning is clear from context. Like [cryptocurrency](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#cryptocurrency "C"), NFTs rely on a form of blockchain ledger markings.

**no one** (two words)

**NORAD** (In stories, spell out early on as: **North American Aerospace Defence Command**) NOTE: Some news organizations prefer "Norad" to avoid abbreviations with five or more capital letters. CBC News abandoned this approach in the fall of 2019 because NORAD is entrenched and easier for our audience to scan. See also [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms)

**nordic** (lowercase), **nordic skiing**, etc. (see also [alpine](/home/a#Alps))

**normal** (OK to describe ranges, such as "normal hearing," but offensive when used to describe people without physical or mental impairments) See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#normal)

**norovirus** (previously known as "Norwalk-like virus") Noroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. They're named after the original strain, **Norwalk virus**, which broke out at a school in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. At least five norovirus genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV and GV) exist. If specifying, avoid the scientific abbreviation for norovirus (NoV). Instead of "NoV GI," for instance, write norovirus GI (lowercase "n," no hyphen), **norovirus GII**, etc. The Norwalk virus is a strain of norovirus.

(See [country names](/home/g/geography-cities) for general guidelines.) The term North Korea is widely understood and helps distinguish the republic from [South Korea](/home/s#SouthKorea). **North Korean** is both an adjective ("a North Korean plane") and the name of the people ("thousands of North Koreans"). The capital city is Pyongyang. See also [Korean War](/home/k#KoreanWar).

**NT** (Newfoundland time) Avoid specifying NST or NDT. See [time](/home/t/time) for detailed guidelines.

**nucleus, nuclei** (plural)

**nuke, nukes** (n.) Generally avoid this colloquial term for **nuclear weapons**. The tone is usually inappropriate for straightforward news reporting. In particular, avoid using nuke(s) in online headlines, where the informal language takes on extra prominence and affects the overall tone of the website, and where it's less effective as a search engine keyword. Do not use "nukes" to mean nuclear power plants because this can create serious ambiguity — especially when key facts are in dispute (e.g., when it's unclear whether a site is being used for nuclear power generation or for nuclear arms research and weapons production).

**[numbers](/home/n/numbers)** (general guidelines)

**number 1, number 4** (always use figures after the word "number," even for amounts or rankings below 10); or **No. 1, No. 4** (always capitalize the abbreviation "No.") For related guidelines, see [series](/home/n/numbers#series) in the numbers overview.

**numskull** (_not_ numbskull)

**Nunatsiavut** (a region of Labrador controlled by [Inuit](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk))

### Nagorno-Karabakh

**Nagorno-Karabakh** (also known as **Artsakh**)

A landlocked **part of the [South Caucasus](/home/s#SouthCaucasus).
**
It's **generally OK to use Nagorno-Karabakh throughout stories** because it's more familiar to our audience. The name is a blend of several languages, including Azerbaijani, Russian and Persian. When practical, pointing out that it's also known as the Republic of Artsakh (or Artsakh) in Armenian can be helpful in some reports, especially if the latter proper noun surfaces in broadcast clips or verbatim web quotes.

**Call Nagorno-Karabakh a disputed region** to avoid taking sides in a conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The local ethnic Armenian majority has administered political control over the enclave since the late 1980s. Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians continue to campaign for independence, as well as for eventual reunification with Armenia. This has led to disagreements over broad principles, such as the territorial integrity of a UN member state versus the self-determination of a region's citizens.


**Background** (fighting, ceasefire, line of contact)

The **modern conflict began in February of 1988**, when the majority Armenian population of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region asked the central Soviet authorities to transfer authority over the territory from Azerbaijani jurisdiction to Armenian jurisdiction. The move reignited simmering ethnic tensions between Azerbaijanis and Armenians leading to violence. While the majority of Azerbaijanis are Shia Muslim and the majority of Armenians are Orthodox Christians, it is not a religious conflict.

Skirmishes between lightly armed Armenian militia groups, Azerbaijani special police forces and the Soviet military started in early 1990. Full-scale fighting over the enclave erupted after the breakup of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, when both sides inherited the Soviet military equipment left behind on their respective territories.

**A 1994 ceasefire** paused the conflict and created what's called the **line of contact** between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. **Do not call it an "occupation line." Also, avoid referring to the disputed territory as "occupied" or "liberated" unless attributed.** Even then, always put such statements into context. Be aware that Turkey sides with Azerbaijan in the dispute.


### names\_common

**Names (common versus legal)**

**People sometimes adopt pseudonyms for various reasons.** This is **particularly true of public figures** (e.g., **Cary Grant** was born Archibald Alec Leach, **Natalie Wood** was born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenkoand, and **Elton John** was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight). They may or may not legally change their names (e.g., **Woody Allen** was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg but legally changed it to Heywood Allen at age 17).

**Unless an original but obscure** or virtually abandoned **(birth) name is directly relevant to a given story** (e.g., appears prominently in a lawsuit), **it's perfectly acceptable to use the individual's common or publicly known name** throughout our coverage (e.g., **writer George Orwell** instead of Eric Arthur Blair, and porn star [**Stormy Daniels**](/home/d#Daniels_Stormy) instead of Stephanie Clifford). **Preferring familiar names makes our journalism clearer**, and, so, serves our audience best.

**Even when a legal name is an essential detail, it's usually better to stick to the common name** (stage name, pen name) in first and subsequent references, **and simply add an explanation, once, in brackets** (e.g., "whose real name is ...").

It's worth noting that **people sometimes start their careers with invented names and then return to their legal or birth names** (e.g., novelist **Stephen King** wrote several books credited to Richard Bachman). **So never assume the less familiar name is the birth name.** Instead, verify the facts. In King's case, Bachman was actually an early _nom de plume_.


**'Kanye' to 'Ye'**
**We lean toward respecting a person's preference, including the use of new legal names** (e.g., in 2021, rapper Kanye West officially became Ye). **To ensure audience understanding, however, we should include brief background in stories** (e.g., "formerly known as Kanye West"). **Generally continue to use a public figure's most recognizable name in first reference, including in web headlines** (e.g., "Adidas ends partnership with Kanye West over antisemitic remarks"). **After that, the new name is OK as long as it's succinctly explained** ("who has legally changed his name to Ye").

Some old names eventually fall out of circulation and, so, can be dropped. In other cases, **public figures may end up being known by more than one name for many year**s (e.g., Cat Stevens and Yosuf often now rendered as **Cat Stevens/Yosuf** for the artist born as Steven Demetre Georgiou). **Be aware that there are exceptions to the general principle of respecting people's preferences**, from handling names that are highly offensive (e.g., that feature the F-word) to dealing with extremely long names that are unwieldy (e.g., containing dozens of letters and symbols).

See also [transgender](/home/t/transgender#former-names) for handling so-called "dead" (former) names.
See also [nicknames and colloquial names](/home/n/nicknames) (Babe Ruth, Dizzy Gillespie), as well as [family versus first names](/home/q/quotes-overview#second-reference-names) in second reference (e.g., for people under 18)
See also [names](/home/n#names) (for general guidelines on Arabic, Asian, French, German and other non-English names)

### names versus logos

**Names versus logos**

**As cute as they are, we're not obligated to publish or broadcast logos masking as proper nouns,** especially when people or organizations take big liberties with capitalization, symbols and punctuation.

**For example:**

> Bravo! and Yahoo! have no exclamation marks: **Bravo and Yahoo** 
>
> RE/MAX Canada has no slash mark and is not all uppercase: **ReMax Canada**
>
> IKEA and INTERPOL are not all uppercase: **Ikea** and [**Interpol**](/home/i#Interpol)
>
> We don't flip the "R" in **Toys "R" Us.**
>
> We don't add invented umlauts (ö and ü) to **Motley Crue.**
>
> \*NSYNC gets standard punctuation for a contraction: **'N Sync**


**This rule applies to the text of our stories as well as to text in our links, and is generally extended to all proper nouns**, including the names of movies and TV programs (e.g., **MASH** not M\*A\*S\*H or M-A-S-H).

The **main exception** is **when a special character** (e.g., + or &) **is actually PRONOUNCED as part of a proper noun or proper noun equivalent** like a company name, brand name, informal association name or event name (e.g., **Disney+**, **Apple TV+**, [**OPEC+**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/o/#OPEC "O"), **A&E** and **A&W**). But guard against such characters replacing text outside of proper nouns or proper noun equivalents (e.g., we still write "300-plus people" and "the invitation calls for a plus-one," and "their teacher gave them a B-plus").

NOTE: Treat non-standard text commonly found in logos and promos (e.g. "cbcnews" and "cbc radio") as graphical variations of the proper nouns preferred in our journalism (CBC News and CBC Radio).


**Evolving logos, such as Wal-Mart to Walmart**
Companies sometimes change their logos, fiddling with capitalization, punctuation, etc. CBC News does not automatically adopt these changes. Adjustments often depend on whether the organization's actual name has been officially revised, and on how widely entrenched the new version becomes. In addition, our general guidelines on names versus logos still apply (e.g., we would not use a symbol such as an asterisk, regardless of the external preference).

Wal-Mart's move to Walmart in its marketing is a good illustration. When the company was founded in the early 1960s, it was known as "WALMART" on signs but Walmart in news coverage. By the 1970s, it was "WAL-MART" on signs but **Wal-Mart** in news coverage. In the early 1990s, the company replaced the hyphen with a star ("WAL\*MART"), but most major news organizations did not (i.e., they retained the noun Wal-Mart). In 2008, the company moved the star to the end of the word and got rid of all but the initial capital letter ("Walmart\*") in its general branding (e.g., Walmart Canada) but not in its actual legal name (Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.).

By 2010, the company was using Walmart on its signs and in virtually all general news releases but still retained Wal-Mart for some official, legal documents. A few news organizations attempted to reflect this complexity by using a different noun depending on the story (e.g., Walmart for store expansions but Wal-Mart for corporate earnings). This became overly confusing, however. So in 2014, editors at different news organizations came up with competing solutions. The Associated Press reverted to Wal-Mart in all of its journalism because that was still the company's legal name. The New York Times, by contrast, ruled that Walmart should always be used, since this is the company's main preference as well as how the store is known to most people.

**To keep our in-house style as simple as possible, CBC News also prefers one spelling.** In late 2014, we switched from Wal-Mart to **Walmart** for the same reasons outlined by the New York Times: **It's the most common spelling used by Walmart, itself, and, therefore, the most recognized form of the name known to our audience.**

When relevant, of course, nothing prevents us from mentioning the company's longer and slightly different legal name, especially in business stories. But in most of our journalism, the spelling **Walmart** is clearest and preferred, including **Walmart Canada** instead of "Wal-Mart Canada Corp."

### nation versus country

**Nation versus country**

**The word country usually refers to the physical or geographical features of a state** (e.g., "_It's one of the world's largest countries" and "The country's climate is perfect for icewine_"), **as well as to its government** (e.g., "_Canada is a democratic country_").

**The term nation, on the other hand, refers to the language, culture, etc., of people.** In colloquial contexts, the word is sometimes extended to communities informally united by a specific sport (e.g., a hockey nation) or similar passions.

In parts of the world (e.g., Europe), many countries are known as "nation-states" because most citizens within a given set of borders share a common heritage. But in other places on the planet, where immigration has played a key role in a state's growth (e.g., Canada), **the word "nation" is a poor synonym for country.**

This distinction has become particularly important in recent years, as various communities have begun asserting their status as nations within the same country (i.e., emphasizing bonds of common identity and demanding recognition). Some [Indigenous people](/home/i/Indigenous) in Canada, for instance, have adopted the term _First Nations_.

Careful writers do not use the term "nation-state" as another label for "sovereign state." They also **avoid tossing words like "nationwide" into news stories when they simply mean "across the country," "countrywide," or "Canada-wide."**

### Netherlands versus Holland

**the Netherlands versus Holland**

The country in northwestern Europe is called **the Netherlands**.

Adjective: **Dutch** (a Dutch company, the Dutch people).

Noun: **Dutch** (the language as well the citizens). _Dutch_ is preferred over _Netherlanders_ to avoid confusion with Caribbean members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands discussed below.

Official capital: **Amsterdam**

Administrative capital (seat of government): **The Hague**

Currency: euro (formerly the guilder)

**Holland is the name of two large, coastal provinces.** North Holland and South Holland are merely one part of the country in the same way that England is one part of the [United Kingdom](/home/u/united-kingdom). Holland includes the three largest cities in the Netherlands: Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam.

**In news stories, generally prefer the _Netherlands_ over _Holland_** when referring to the entire country. Reserve Holland for historical references (e.g., Second World War military campaigns), entrenched colloquial usage (e.g., in soccer coverage) and other casual contexts.

The **Kingdom of the Netherlands** is a constitutional monarchy. It's made up of the Netherlands as well as two distant states, each with separate, self-government: **the Netherlands Antilles** (which includes several islands in the Caribbean) and Aruba. Their citizens are **Netherlands Antilleans** and **Arubans**, respectively.

See also [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the) for related guidelines (the Netherlands but The Hague)

### Newfoundland and Labrador

**Newfoundland and Labrador**
**N.L. instead of Nfld.**

The official name of the province was changed to Newfoundland and Labrador in late 2001, although the abbreviation Nfld. remained common for several years. **CBC News adopted N.L. during the summer of 2005.** Do not use the old shorthand, Nfld., except in rare cases in web headlines when referring specifically to the island — as outlined below. **Be aware that many stories refer only to "Newfoundland" or only to "Labrador"** (i.e., that **you do not need to use the full, spelled-out name of the province in all coverage**, especially in broadcast scripts).

**Political entity vs. geographical location**
**Newfoundland and Labrador** (abbreviated as **N.L.**) is the compound name of a single province. This means the proper noun constitutes a **pan-regional reference** to a political entity.

**Newfoundland** and **Labrador** on their own **are specific geographical references** within the province (e.g., "central Newfoundland" and "the northern coast of Labrador").

**St. John's**, therefore, is t**he capital of Newfoundland and Labrador** rather than the "capital of Newfoundland." But it's **located on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland** and NOT on the "coast of Newfoundland and Labrador." Anything that happened to be simultaneously on the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador would be newsworthy in its own right.

Be aware that **online and on-air conventions can vary slightly.**

-   **In WEB writing, N.L. is commonly used when specific geographical detail is deemed necessary** in a string of proper nouns (e.g., **Bonavista, N.L.**, and **Red Bay, N.L.**, but St. John's on its own, for [reasons explained below](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador#story)).

-   **In BROADCAST stories, "N.L." is not generally used in the same way.** Instead of spelling out the entire abbreviation, **only one of the components is normally added to a string of proper nouns** (e.g., "Most of the movie was shot in **Bonavista, Newfoundland**," and "The treasure was discovered at the bottom of **Red Bay, Labrador**").

**Web headlines and decks**
**Use N.L. in almost all web headlines:**

> _N.L. demands new deal with Canada_
>
> _Abitibi cuts paper production in Ontario, N.L._
>
> _N.L. fishermen vow to fight cod limits_
>
> _PM slams N.L. premier over flag flap_


**Use Nfld. in web headlines in rare cases when you mean the island only,** as in _central Nfld._ (not "central N.L."). The on-air equivalent would be a headline at the start of a broadcast program that referred to "central Newfoundland." **Spell out Labrador when used alone in web headlines**, however, since there is no conventional abbreviation. Coining shorthand (e.g., "Lbrd.") can confuse our audience and make CBC internet content harder to find through search engines.

**Never drop the periods in geographical shorthand.** Standard abbreviations for provinces and territories include punctuation (e.g., Alta., Ont. and N.L.), according to the Geographical Names Board of Canada (GNBC). Postal code "symbols" (AB, ON and NL), by contrast, do not. (See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#abbreviating) for details)


**Story bodies, photo captions, etc.**
**Use N.L. after community names** to represent the provincial component of geographical locations **IN ONLINE STORIES**. A second comma is always required Unless the abbreviation falls at the end of the sentence:

> _Labrador City, N.L._
>
> _They flew to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, N.L., last March._
>
> _She was born in Swift Current, Sask., but grew up in Pouch Cove, N.L._
>
> _The bus broke down near Witless Bay, N.L._


**The province's capital does not require N.L. after it** (i.e., refer to **St. John's**, not to "St. John's, N.L."), for the same reason we don't write "Edmonton, Alta." or "Regina, Sask." or "Winnipeg, Man." See the [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) overview for comprehensive guidelines.

**Do not use N.L. as an adjective or as a noun on its own**, as you would B.C. or P.E.I. (e.g., "The B.C. town" and "Their trip to P.E.I.") **The test is whether an abbreviation is established in spoken English. N.L. is not**, while B.C. and P.E.I. are as common as UN, RCMP, U.K. and U.S. **Instead, apply the same guidelines to N.L. that you do for N.S. and N.B. Spell out the region's name when using it as an adjective or as a noun** on its own in the main body of a story:

> _A Labrador town ..._
>
> _Their trip to Newfoundland ..._
>
> _The treasure was discovered in southern Newfoundland ..._ (not _"in southern Nfld."_ )
>
> _Newfoundland and Labrador's education system ..._ (not _"N.L.'s education system"_ ) 

**When to add 'and Labrador'**
**When specifically referring to just Newfoundland or to just Labrador, you do not need to use the region's full title:**

> _They're fighting to keep the Labrador mine open._
>
> _Dozens of boats were stolen from six Newfoundland villages._
>
> _Authorities believe the ship sank somewhere along northern Labrador's coastline._
>
> _The planes collided about 30 kilometres southeast of Newfoundland._
>
> _Labrador's economic development was badly hurt by the hydro project's collapse._


**But whenever you're writing about the entire province (or implying a provincial context), use the full name and treat it as a collective singular:**

> _Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams refused to sign the accord._
>
> _They're suing the government of Newfoundland and Labrador for $5 million._
>
> _Newfoundland and Labrador disputes the federal scientists' findings._ (not _"dispute"_ )
>
> _She says Newfoundland and Labrador's deficit is still too high._ (not _"deficits are"_ )
>
> _Newfoundland and Labrador promises to back B.C. at the trade hearing._ (not _"promise"_ )


**This conventionally applies even to provincial references before 2001, when Labrador was officially added to the proper noun.**

> _Former Newfoundland and Labrador premiers Brian Tobin and Clyde Wells both ..._


**NOTE: Follow the traditional "bacon and eggs" exception to the [serial comma](/handy-links/punctuation/commas#serial) rule** and include the punctuation:

> _They talked to prosecutors from Quebec, New Brunswick**,** and Newfoundland and Labrador._

**Newfoundlanders and Labradorians**
Residents of Newfoundland are **Newfoundlanders**.
Residents of Labrador are **Labradorians**.
Reserve **Newfoundlanders and Labradorians** to pan-provincial contexts (i.e., in general references to citizens of the entire province).


> NOTE: **Avoid the colloquial but non-parallel construction "Newfoundland and Labradorians."** Just as we refer to Albertans and Manitobans rather than to "Alberta and Manitobans," we need to add suffixes to both proper noun elements in N.L. (i.e., Newfoundlanders and Labradorians). In English, these words are known as demonyms (Canadians, Albertans, Calgarians, Ontarians, Nova Scotians, New Brunswickers). We get audience complaints when such terms are used inconsistently or improperly.

**Retain proper names**
**Do not invent new names for established nouns.**

It's still the **Royal Newfoundland Constabulary**, even though the force describes itself as Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial police service. (For the record, officers patrol only certain places, such as St. John's, Corner Brook, Labrador City and Churchill Falls. These communities make up about 40 per cent of the province's total population. As in many other parts of Canada, the rest of the policing is handled by the RCMP.)

See [police forces](/home/p/police-forces) for relevant details on capitalization rules, etc.


**Time zones (NT and AT)**
NT stands for **Newfoundland time**. Never call it "Newfoundland and Labrador time."

In fact, most of Labrador is on Atlantic time (30 minutes behind St. John's).

**Always use the relevant local time zone (either NT or AT)**. Avoid the abbreviations NST, AST, NDT or ADT. See [time](/home/t/time) for other relevant style rules.


**Beware of nicknames**
The colloquial term **the Rock** conventionally refers to the island only, not to Labrador. This is the definition given by the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. The label is considered very informal and should be posted only if the piece's tone is appropriately light. In general, we should limit its use to transcribed quotes.

Some other less widely known nicknames are OK but should be defined for readers. For instance, **the Front** (the traditional name of the seal hunt along Newfoundland's northeast coast) and **the Gulf fishery** (a common name for the cod catch along Newfoundland's southwest coast) require brief descriptions.


**N.L. background**
Although some media outlets continued to use Nfld. as their abbreviation for the province for many years, **CBC News adopted N.L. for five reasons:**

**1\. It recognizes the province's official name change.** (When Canada's Constitution was amended on Dec. 6, 2001, "Newfoundland" became "Newfoundland and Labrador.")

**2\. It matches the Government of Canada's official geographical names database** (compiled and updated by Natural Resources Canada). Ottawa now uses N.L. as the preferred abbreviation for Newfoundland and Labrador.

**3\. It's similar to the official Canada Post abbreviation** (NL) embraced by Newfoundland and Labrador's government, although our style requires periods.

**4\. It's a close cousin of many of our other provincial short forms** (N.S., N.B., and B.C.).

**5\. It's much shorter than other proposals**, such as Nfld.-Lab.

**2005 Update: The Canadian Press officially adopted N.L. a few months after CBC News.**

### Nicknames

**Nicknames, colloquial nouns**

[Overuse](/home/n/nicknames#overuse) (Does Red Planet add colour?) 

[Accuracy](/home/n/nicknames#caution) (Beware Big Ben)

**Overview**
**Use initial caps for most entrenched nicknames and colloquial or fanciful names.** For example:

> _Babe Ruth_
>
> _the Big Nickel_  (Sudbury)
>
> _the Big Smoke_
>
> _the Big Three_
>
> _Boat People_
>
> _the Cold War_
>
> _the Deep South_
>
> _Generation Z or Gen Z_
> the _Golden Horseshoe_
>
> _Grits_
>
> _the Industrial Revolution_
>
> _the Iron Curtain_
>
> _Mother Nature_
>
> the _Panhandle_ (in Florida)
>
> _the Quiet Revolution_
>
> _Red Chamber_
>
> _Red Planet_
>
> _the Rust Belt_
>
> _Silicon Valley_
>
> _the Superstack_  (iconic smokestack in Sudbury)
>
> _Tiger Williams_
>
> _Tories_
>
> _the Windsor Hum_


**This includes various names from science, religion, etc., treated as proper noun equivalents:**


> the Ark of the Covenant (Judaism, Christianity)
>
> the Big Bang
>
> the Crown of Thorns
>
> the Holy Grail (but holy water)
>
> the Holy Mantle (Islam)
>
> the Last Supper
>
> the Shroud of Turin


NOTE: Initial caps do not telegraph that something is proven, genuine, etc. The Big Bang is a prevailing theory about how the universe began, but it's still a theory. And pieces of wood said to be from the True Cross are conventionally described as religious relics that some people believe are from the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

For religious names, see [the Deity but the devil](/home/d/the-deity-and-the-devil) (e.g., the Almighty, the Father, the Holy Spirit, the Prophet, the Son, Satan).

**TIP: The primary capitalization tests are whether nouns are unique** (or at the very least apply to a relatively small number of people, places or things), **and reasonably established**. This does not mean they need to be widely known. Sometimes a colloquialism has simply been adopted by a given group (e.g., residents of a community, auto industry analysts, sports writers, historians). In those cases, the key is making sure that the term is understood in the story — either by context or definition.

**If only part of a compound is used in second reference, drop the capitalization:**

> _the Big Three_ becomes _the three_
>
> _the Red Planet_ becomes _the planet_
>
> _the Windsor Hum_ becomes _the hum_ (i.e., "hum" on its own is treated as generic)

**But retain capitalization when an optional proper noun is dropped** in second reference:


> the Florida _Panhandle_ becomes _the Panhandle_ because Florida is not essential to the original compound (e.g., the Panhandle in Florida, Florida's Panhandle)


**Sometimes an entire term is kept lowercase in first reference because it's simply not unique** (e.g., there has been only one _Iron Age_ but several ice ages). See [historical periods](/home/h/historical-periods) for details and more examples.

**Narrow meaning of term 'nickname'**
**The term _nickname_ normally refers to a second, often shorter, name:**

> _The four-engine KC-135 jet, nicknamed the Weightless Wonder, is used to train astronauts._


**If something doesn't have a proper name, it technically can't have a nickname. So avoid using the word as a mere synonym for _named, called, dubbed, known as_, etc.**

> _The shallow depression near the rover’s landing spot is called_ (not nicknamed) _Sleepy Hollow._


This spot on Mars does not have any formal name. It's simply a small depression, about half the length of a bowling alley, within the Gusev crater. Until the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gives it a name, the depression can't have a nickname.

Scientists, by the way, reportedly began calling it Sleepy Hollow in January 2004 because they didn’t get much rest studying all the pictures being transmitted to Earth. It would be misleading to say NASA formally _named_ it Sleepy Hollow, since this would be up to the IAU. But it would also be wrong to say the space agency _nicknamed_ it. Scientists simply dubbed it Sleepy Hollow on their own. So **while it's certainly OK to say that an agency like NASA has informally named something in space, avoid wording that implies the name is official** unless it's been approved by the IAU.

**Brackets optional
****Use brackets, **not** quotations marks, to identify a nickname inserted into a proper noun:**

> _John Birks (Dizzy) Gillespie_
>
> _Joseph (Joey) Smallwood_
>
> _Dave (Tiger) Williams_


**But you can also use a nickname alone in first reference if it's more common than the proper name.**

> _Dizzy Gillespie_
>
> _Joey Smallwood_
>
> _Tiger Williams_
>
> _Cy Young_ (His first name was actually Denton; Cy was short for _The Cyclone_.)



**Reserve quotation marks to mean 'so-called'**
**When a nickname is not widely known, quotation marks can help flag it. But** since inverted commas normally suggest "so-called" in this context, **it's generally best to limit the use of such punctuation for times when you want to convey that added meaning:**

> _There's no doubt Anderson is the new "It Boy" of hip-hop._
>
> _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was the "It Girl" of IT last year._


See [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for general guidelines on when to use single (' ') or double (" ") inverted commas.

**Spelling disputes**
**In general, use CBC News style for generic words in a nickname unless this spelling conflicts with well-established convention or an individual's clear personal preference.**

**Do not rely solely on the dictionary. Check the Language Guide first.** For instance, both CBC News and CP prefer phoney over phony, even though the Canadian Oxford lists phony as its primary spelling:

> _Larry (Phoney Baloney) Brooks_

**An individual's personal preference trumps in-house style.** For instance, while smoky is our usual spelling, with smokey listed as only a variation in the Canadian Oxford, the following Canadian war hero and his family embraced the extra vowel:

> _Ernest (Smokey) Smith_


**Also, retain the original spellings of proper nouns and well-established nicknames:**

> _Smokey Bear_ (this is a noun not a nickname, and there's no "the" in the middle)
>
> _Smokey Robinson_ (a spelling clearly preferred by this U.S. citizen)


**One helpful guide is the absence of brackets.** If the label in question is _not_ in brackets, it's generally either a proper noun or a very well-established nickname that functions as a proper noun.

**Does the 'Red Planet' add colour?**
**Use capital letters for names and nicknames**, such as _the Milky Way_ and _the Rockies_.

Nicknames can help writing. They provide variety and often a welcome dash of colour.

But they can also become tiresome quickly within the same story. For instance, repeatedly calling Mars the Red Planet or Canada's Senate the _Red Chamber_ will probably be considered trite by many readers, listeners or viewers, so it's wise to e_xercise some restraint_.

**Beware Big Ben**
**Colloquial names require care. Make sure they apply.**

For instance, **_Big Ben_ is the name of the massive, 13.5-ton bell in the famous clock on the Houses of Parliament in Britain** that marks the hours. It is not the name of the bells that strike on the quarter-hours. It is also **not the name of the tower or of the clock itself** — which for more than a century was technically known as either the "Westminster Clock Tower" or as "the clock on St. Stephen's Tower at the Palace of Westminster."

In September 2012, the structure was renamed **Elizabeth Tower** in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. Until this name becomes widely used, however, it's acceptable to continue to refer to it as **Big Ben's tower** (lowercase "t"), since this possessive form accurately describes the famous landmark that holds the iconic bell.

### Nobel Prizes

**Nobel Prizes**

**The generic word "prize" is uppercase if it's next to the name Nobel:**

Nobel Prize
Nobel Prizes
Nobel Prize winner
Nobel Prize laureate
Nobel Prize-winning researcher
the prize, the peace prize, the prize for chemistry, the prizes, etc.


**Nobel in always capitalized** because it's a proper noun element:

a Nobel
the Nobel for physics

**Official names of the prizes**
the Nobel Peace Prize
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
the Nobel Prize in Literature
the Nobel Prize in Medicine (or Physiology, whichever applies)
the Nobel Prize in Physics
the Nobel in economics (not the "Nobel Prize in Economics")
or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science (See explanation below)

**Why no "Prize" in economics?**

The economics award is not strictly a Nobel Prize because it’s funded by the Bank of Sweden in memory of Alfred Nobel. It’s known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.

But in news stories it can be called the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science (singular, uppercase), or the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics (plural lowercase), or the Nobel in economics (plural, lowercase).

**A capital C, for consistency
**
The Canadian Press and some other news organization don't capitalize most of the categories (e.g. chemistry or literature). They make an exception for "Peace" because it's in the middle of "Nobel" and "Prize."

CBC News, the New York Times and many other media organizations take a different approach. We capitalize all the words in the name of each award (except economics for reasons outlined above). So in a wire story, you might see "the Nobel Prize in physics" but should write "the Nobel Prize in Physics."

For more information about Nobel Prizes, including past winners, visit the [Nobel Foundation's website.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nobel.se%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2o3uO3lrFIjXHeQiEA023p)

### non-confidence

**Non-confidence vote**

**Canadian governments need the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons to stay in power.**

Governments can fall if they fail to pass an official test of this confidence, but such a loss doesn’t automatically trigger an election. The Governor General might refuse the prime minister’s request for dissolution and, instead, call on the Official Opposition to form the government if there were evidence that this party could secure and maintain the confidence of the House.

**Non-confidence motions come in several forms.** The most common is a vote on a major piece of legislation (such as a throne speech, which sets out the direction the government plans to take), or a money bill (including the budget). The government can also attach confidence motions to any measures, no matter how minor. And opposition parties can table non-confidence motions on certain days.


**Non-confidence versus no-confidence**
The term "no-confidence" was used for years. Authoritative manuals such as _Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms_ backed it. This was also the language found in the 1985 Report of the Special Committee on Reform of the House of Commons (known as "the McGrath report"), and in the old House Standing Orders, when all supply motions were considered matters of confidence in the government.

But more recent guides, such as the _House of Commons Procedure and Practice_ by Robert Marleau and Camille Montpetit (first published in 2000), have featured "no-confidence" and "non-confidence" interchangeably. And several books, including _The Language of Canadian Politics and The House of Commons at Work_, use only "non-confidence." In November 2005, the head of communications for the Speaker’s office told CBC News that both labels were considered acceptable. By the end of the decade, however, there had been a noticeable shift toward "non-confidence" as the preferred choice off and on Parliament Hill.


**Use non-confidence**
Language evolves. Although the traditional term "no-confidence" still crops up from time to time, **non-confidence** is the much more widely used adjective and noun. That's why it was adopted as the **CBC News preference** at the end of April 2010:

> a non-confidence motion
>
> a non-confidence vote
>
> a motion of non-confidence
>
> a vote of non-confidence
>
> a confidence motion
>
> a confidence vote


The only exceptions are directly transcribed quotes that feature the older phrase "no-confidence." Such verbatim quotes should not be changed.

**When there are different approaches to certain words, it's important to be consistent.** Our writers and editors don't need to waste time debating which version to go with, and our audience isn't left bouncing between different forms on a whim. That's why we pick the adverb [backward](/home/w/ward-versus-wards), for instance, instead of "backwards" (e.g., "They walked backward"), and spellings such as colour and skeptic (instead of "color" and "sceptic").

For more background on minority governments and non-confidence motions in Canada, see the feature: [When the majority doesn’t rule](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fwhen-the-majority-doesn-t-rule-1.728726&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2XF0RDQ7g9TsJ5Ks1735kT).

### non-consensual-sex

**Non-consensual sex**

This entrenched **expression requires care.**

**1\. The first issue is whether consent can actually be granted.
**

> **Children**
>
> The **term "non-consensual sex" is inappropriate in stories about minors** who've been allegedly assaulted by adults. **So are expressions like "underage sex partners,"** which imply something far different from the accusations of abuse and exploitation that are at the heart of such criminal cases.
>
>
> **Adults**
>
> **Even when the alleged victims are 18 and older, it's possible that consent cannot be lawfully given** — e.g., because someone is impaired by alcohol or drugs, by a cognitive condition, etc. So be sure the facts fit before referring to "non-consensual" sex. Be aware, too, that the age of consent may vary from country to country.


**2\. The second issue is whether more direct wording is better** because it's clearer.

In our adversarial legal system, "non-consensual" is commonly used to contest a person's claim that a given act was "consensual." This includes various federal Justice Department documents and Supreme Court of Canada rulings that refer to "non-consensual sex."

However, **the term "non-consensual sex" can be a roundabout, almost bureaucratic, way of saying "sexual assault."** So while it's OK to report that "the accused says the sex was consensual," it's often best to balance the story with the language actually used by the alleged victim (e.g., "She says he sexually assaulted her despite being repeatedly told to stop").

See also [child, teen, young adult, etc.](/home/c/child_teen) (for guidelines on age ranges)


### none\_is\_are

**None is and none are**

**BOTH are OK in virtually all contexts:
**

> _None is ...
> None are ..._


**ALL major English grammar authorities surveyed agree on this point** — from Fowler and Bernstein to Gowers and Partridge.

Some people cling to the idea that "none" is an abbreviation for "not one." But this is simplistic. "None" also conventionally means "not any" and "no people or things." In his classic 1984 treasury, _A Dictionary of Troublesome Words_, Bill Bryson starts his entry bluntly:


> "The widely held belief that none must be singular is a myth.... "


**The key is to be consistent within the same web article, broadcast script, etc.** So pick one (none is/none are) and stick to it throughout a given story.

The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage points out that **the only time we're required to use the singular verb with "none" is when we mean "no part of a mass or whole,"** as in:


> _None of it MAKES sense._ (SINGULAR CORRECT)
> _None of it MAKE sense._ (PLURAL WRONG)


See [grammar](/handy-links/grammar) for an alphabetical list of various guidelines

### nor versus or

**Nor versus or**

**Neither ... nor, either ... or**
**There's usually no confusion when pairing these conjunctions with their correlatives** (_neither ... nor_ on the one hand, and _either ... or_ on the other).

> They can have **either** beer **or** wine. (correct and conversational)
>
> He **neither** sings **nor** dances. (correct but formal)
>
> He **doesn't** sing **or** dance. (correct and conversational)


But a few structural weaknesses are common. Always remember:

**1\. Sentences should be parallel**, especially when written for the eye (the web) rather than for the ear.

> They can have **either** sugar **or** honey. (balanced; _either_ refers to nouns)
>
> They can either have sugar or honey. (unbalanced; _either_ refers to verb _have_)
>
> She's **either in** Saskatoon **or in** Regina. (prepositional form is balanced)
>
> She's either in Saskatoon or Regina. (unbalanced; a second preposition is usually recommended)
>
> He will **neither do** this **nor do** that. (clauses balanced)
>
> He will neither do this nor that. (unbalanced; a second verb is usually recommended)


**2\. When singular subjects are connected by nor/or, the verb should generally be kept singular.**

> **Neither** Burton nor Kashinato **supports** the proposal. (not "support")
>
> **Either** French or English **is** fine. (not "are")


**3\. When any subjects are plural, however, the rules of disjunctive conjunctions kick in**, which means that the elements being linked to by nor/or are considered separately, depending on sentence construction. **In formal writing, one custom is to match the verb with the nearest subject:**

> Either several cards or just one **is** chosen.
>
> Either just one or several cards **are** chosen.

**But such constructions can wind up being needlessly stilted**. As a result, **many good editors recommend either recasting so that the plural comes last, or simply using a plural verb, regardless of word order:**

> Neither the team's owner nor players **agree**.
> Neither the players nor the team's owner **agree**.

**Not ... or, not ... nor**
**When the word "not" refers to two or more verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc., we normally connect these parts of the sentence with "or."**

> He **didn't** laugh **or** cry.
>
> The bicycle is **not** in the garage **or** in the basement.


**It's perfectly acceptable to use "nor" after a pause, however, if we want to emphasize a second verb, noun, adjective, etc.** This can be at the start of a new fragment, clause or an entirely new sentence.

> The players **couldn't** stand the coach's pep talks. **Nor** could they put up with his wild mood swings.
>
> His grandmother **didn't** call that weekend, **nor** the next. He knew something was wrong.
>
> The typographical error **did not create** ambiguity **nor alter** the sentence's meaning.


**But using a negative conjunction this way has its limits.** The most common mistake is to use "nor" for "or" when there's no need to separate a sentence's parts in a special way for emphasis:

> They **weren't** buying necklaces **or** bracelets. (correct)
>
> They weren't buying necklaces nor bracelets. (poor; non-standard)


**As with a lot of writing, of course, the choice between "or" and "nor" is often subjective. Sometimes it largely depends on whether you want to underscore a certain word or idea.**

> Their immediate problem is **neither** food **nor** shelter. It's water. (correct)
>
> Their immediate problem is **not** food **or** shelter. It's water. (correct)
>
> Their immediate problem is **not** food, **nor** is it shelter. It's water. (correct)

### normality

**Normality versus normalcy**

For consistency, generally **prefer the noun normality over normalcy** (e.g., "return to normality").

**Both terms refer to a common or usual state.** They're used with roughly equal frequency across the country, according to the Oxford Guide to Canadian English.

**Normality is the older word**, coined in the 1830s. **Normalcy**, which surfaced a few decades later, **gained popularity in the United States in the 1920s**, according to lexicographers.

**Some grammarians initially derided normalcy**, saying the -acy suffix is typically found only in nouns tied to adjectives ending in "t" or "te" (e.g., _accuracy, complacency, hesitancy_ and _pregnancy_ are linked to the modifiers _accurate, complacent, hesitant_ and _pregnant_). However, **normalcy gradually became entrenched as an acceptable synonym**.

### North, South, East and West

**North, South, East and West**

**Capitalize recognized regions** (whether a local neighbourhood, such as _Vancouver's Downtown Eastside_, a group of communities, such as _Upstate New York,_ a section of a country or continent, such as the _Eastern Seaboard_, or a large part of the globe, such as the _Western Hemisphere_). **But do not generally capitalize mere derivatives** (_Western Canada_ but a _western Canadian_, and the _East Coast_ but the _eastern provinces_).

Sometimes this can lead to debates. _Southern California_ is uppercase because it's frequently referred to this way while _southern Oregon_ and _northern France_ are not. When deciding whether to use initial caps, survey a few large Western news organizations, such as CP and AP, to see if consistent usage has become entrenched. Keep in mind that logic can help determine style. For instance, _western Sudan_ has always been lowercase as a generic reference. By contrast, _Southern Sudan_ was given initial capital letters after winning limited autonomy as a region. The latter eventually became the independent country of _South Sudan_ in 2011.

For consistency **we write _eastern Quebec, southern Ontario, western Saskatchewan, northern Alberta_, etc. But regions, such _the B.C. Interior_, are uppercase, as are terms such as _Western governments_ and _Western leaders_ and _Western media_** when referring to the _Western Hemisphere_. This is also the approach taken by most wire services.

**In plural constructions, common noun elements become lowercase** (e.g., _the Northern and Southern hemispheres_).
**The points of the compass** (mere direction or position) **are lowercase** (the North but a _northern city_, the West Coast but the _west coast of Vancouver Island_, Quebec's Eastern Townships but the _east end of Montreal_).

Although cardinal direction (N, S, E, W) can help our audience pinpoint a geographical location, **be aware that entrenched terminology preferred in a given region can sometimes be confusing to a national audience.** For example, Ontario is traditionally divided into two broad halves: north and south. Since the city of Ottawa is in the south, it's technically (and accurately) part of [**southern Ontario**](/home/s#southernOntario) — as noted by numerous authorities, from official government of Ontario road maps to Elections Canada riding maps. However, **Ottawa** is also conventionally referred to as being in **eastern Ontario** rather than to being in **southern Ontario** or **southeastern Ontario**. In cases like this, generally prefer the established, local convention as long as the meaning is clear (e.g., "Lockdown restrictions have been extended to eastern Ontario"). Another option is to use a specific community's name (e.g., "Pandemic lockdown restrictions in parts of southern Ontario have been extended to Ottawa and neighbouring communities").

### Numbers

**Numbers**
The following rules apply to the main text of web stories, most TV graphics, etc. A separate section on headlines appears at the bottom of the page.

[One to nine](/home/n/numbers#general) (general)
[1 to 9](/home/n/numbers#exceptions) (exceptions)

[Symbols](/home/n/numbers#symbols) ($, %, etc.)
[Series](/home/n/numbers#series) (page 2 but Chapter 8)
[Alphanumeric designations](/home/n/numbers#alphanumeric) (M-16 versus M16; DC-10 but J50)
[Figures written out](/home/n/numbers#figures) (Grade 9 but ninth grade)
[10 and up](/home/n/numbers#10andup) (general)
[Ten and up](/home/n/numbers#tenandup) (exceptions)

[Combinations](/home/n/numbers#combinations) (two and 11)
[Heights, weights, etc.](/home/n/numbers#heightsandweights) (imperial versus metric)
[Dimensions](/home/n/numbers#dimensions) (a 4-by-6 photo, the room is 12 by 9 feet)
Generally use [arabic not roman](/home/n/numbers#arabicroman) numerals
[Ordinals](/home/n/numbers#ordinals) (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Use of "[per cent](/home/n/numbers#percent)"


[Miscellaneous](/home/n/numbers#miscellaneous) (three degrees or 3 C, 1950s or '50s, .22-calibre rifle, addresses, phone numbers, etc.)

See also the [**imperial versus metric**](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) overview

**One to nine** **(general)**
**In most cases, write out numbers between one and nine:**

> _The report was written by six people. It included seven recommendations._
>
> _The truck was carrying more than four million litres of fuel._
>
> _The Detroit Three and the Big Five banks refused to comment._
>
> _CBC Radio One will broadcast the event live._


**This includes common names of vehicles** (four-by-four), **types of lumber**, etc., unless in [headlines](/home/n/numbers#inheadlines) (4x4).The four-by-four drove over a two-by-four about one-third into the race. **But convention plays a role, including in how standard dimensions are reported** (e.g., four-by-four lumber versus a photo that's 4 by 6).


**1 to 9** **(common exceptions)**
5-4 ruling, 6-2 odds, a ratio of 3.5 to 1, the quake had a magnitude of 7.2, Grade 6, Highway 3, they met at 5 o'clock (also known as 5 p.m.), it was 9 C outside, Act 2, Scene 3, page 4, paragraph 5, line 6, verse 7, Chapter 8, Day 1, Type 2 diabetes, Level 3 charger, Category 4 hurricane, 5G wireless network, Treaty 7, Article 8, Cloud 9, Phase 2, a 3D film, a glossy 8 by 10, Round 5, Room 6, size 7 shoes, a V-8 engine, an 8-mm camera, a 9-mm pistol, Channel 6, a Dash 7, behind the 8-ball, Apollo 9, they're No. 1, back to Square 1, a Leopard 1 tank, aboard the QE2, listening to CBC Radio 3, drinking 7Up, 1 MB, 2 GB, RR3, the 4-H club, Lotto 6/49, [9/11](/home/s#Sept11) (for informal references to Sept. 11, 2001), and [911](/home/p/phone-numbers) (the phone number).

**Generally maintain exceptions, even when this results in a blend of figures and words** within the same sentence or story. **When reporting measurements, however, avoid combining spelled-out numbers with figures. Instead, generally prefer figures across the board**, especially when they apply to the same units (inches, metres):

> _She worked for CBC Radio One before joining CBC Radio 3._
>
> _At least six people died in the Category 3 hurricane._
>
> _They fought over an autographed 8 by 10._
>
> _A 16-by-9 aspect ratio means 16 units wide by 9 units high._


See [single-sentence combinations](/home/n/numbers#combinations) (two and 11) for related guidelines.

See also [ages](/home/n/numbers#ages) and [symbols](/home/n/numbers#symbols) below, as well as the [capitalization overview](/home/c/capitalization) (for details on distinctions such as "Category 5 hurricane" versus "Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 storm").

**For guidelines on handling two-digit numbers and higher, see [10 and up](/home/n/numbers#10andup)** below, which covers general principles as well as exceptions (e.g., when a figure like 10 is written as ten, such as at the start of a sentence).


**Ages**
**Use figures for all ages that stand alone immediately after a name. Otherwise, spell out numbers under 10:**

> _Elizabeth, 4, has a sister, six, and a brother, nine._
>
> _Danny, five months old, stopped crying as soon as the taxi began moving._


**Don't bother adding "years" or "years old" when the context makes it obvious:**

> _She was 63 at the time._
>
> _His granddaughter was seven._

**Hyphenate ages in adjectives as well as nouns:**

> _The eight-year-old girl laughed._
>
> _The 16-year-old scoffed._

**TIP –** **Cumbersome compounds can be avoided if ages are set off by commas:**

> _Wilson, 22, is studying chemistry_ (instead of _The 22-year-old chemistry student ..._)

See also [child, teen, young adult, etc.](/home/c/child_teen), for general guidelines on labelling age groups.


**Symbols**
**Use figures, **not** words, when the number under 10 is tied directly to a symbol:**

> _$2_ or _two dollars_ but never 2 dollars. (See also [money](/home/n/numbers#money))
>
> _5 C_ or _five degrees_ but never 5 degrees. (See also [temperatures](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#temperatures))
>
> _3%_ or _three per cent_ but never 3 per cent. (See also [per cent](/home/n/numbers#percent))


**But figures are OK when the number under 10 that's tied to a symbol is a fraction:**

> Four francs, but _4.5 francs_.
>
> Three percentage points but _3.5 percentage points_.


(See also [common fractions](/home/n/numbers#fractions))


**Series**
**Generally capitalize nouns before figures if the units represent one part of a numbered series** (Act 3, Article 4, Bill C-5, Block 6, Channel 7, Chapter 8, Cloud 9, Figure 10, Grade 11, Part 2, Phase 3, Room 404, Section 50, Square 1, Round 2, Volume 11, Ward 6). But **words after the figure generally remain lowercase** (e.g., a [Category 5 hurricane](/home/w/weather-words#category), Level 3 chargers, Type 2 diabetes). This typography is different from colour-based shorthand, which is lowercase (e.g., [code red, code blue](/home/c#codecolours)).

**Use lowercase for plural constructions** (articles 14 and 15, chapters 5-6, grades 8-12), **as well as for a smattering of nouns** (almost all tied to publishing) **that are rarely capitalized based on convention** (number 1, page 2, paragraph 3, sentence 4, size 5, verse 6, line 7). This includes subjective groupings that are common only within certain communities (e.g., references by some Canadian police officers to level 1 sexual assault, level 2 sexual assault, etc., even though these rankings do not appear in the Criminal Code).

**Although a few words can be abbreviated before a figure** (page 2 or p. 2, Section 50 or Sec. 50, Volume 11 or Vol. 11), **it's generally best to spell them out in news stories.** The term **"number" is a common exception worth noting.** When abbreviated, the word takes on an initial capital (number 1, number 2, number 3 becomes No. 1, No. 2, No. 3).

Unlike in boxing, the term **Round of 16** doesn't refer to a sequence (the "sixteenth round"). Rather, it describes the number of teams remaining (16 out of 32) in the second phase of the [FIFA World Cup](/home/f/fifa-world-cup-2010).


**Alphanumeric designations**
**There's no single alphanumeric naming system.** For instance, **M-16** (with a hyphen) commonly refers to a rifle, while **M16** (fused) is a "deep space object" that astronomer's also call the Eagle nebula.

We **normally follow established industry letter-number naming conventions, including typography**, unless there's an editorial reason to diverge (e.g., if a given set of numbers and letters is too difficult to read without the aid of punctuation, or if unorthodox capitalization clashes with our own general style).

For instance, some types of aircraft feature hyphens (e.g., **DC-10, MD-11**) while others don't (**A340, CS300**). Punctuation depends on various factors, including whether the letters represent true abbreviations or merely spots in a sequence. Regardless, when used, we usually place the hyphens before figures rather than after them (**747B**), based on traditional publishing style. See [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names) for details and other examples.

**It's generally OK to adopt widely followed naming conventions we encounter during routine newsgathering**, unless a specific exception is listed in the Language Guide. **If you have doubts about a proper noun, nickname, letter-number combination, etc., consult a reputable authority.** In marine biology, for instance, scientists track individual **orcas** by giving them unique alphanumeric labels (e.g., **J50** and **L123**). These designations traditionally have no hyphens or spaces. The letter represents an identified group of whales (e.g., **J pod** and **L pod**), while the number represents a specific orca within that population. And in the case of air quality measurements, scientists tend to fuse terms such as **PM2.5** to underscore that the fine "particulate matter" is 2.5 microns or less in diameter, versus say **PM5** or **PM10** pollutants.

Be aware that **there's no universal approach to typography even within the same field.** In astronomy, for instance, various cataloguing systems are used, so the same galaxy, nebula, globular cluster, etc., is sometimes known by more than one label — e.g., the "Owl nebula" is referred to as both **M97** (M fused to the numerical designation) as well as **NGC 3587** (with a space between the letters and numbers).

**For serial numbers, manufacturing codes, etc., it's normally quickest and clearest to render the sequence verbatim**, including hyphens or other characters (e.g., in a web story about a product recall).

**Figures written out**
**Sometimes an abbreviation that uses a figure** (the G8) **can also be written out** (the Group of Eight countries).

**Figures are almost always used in headlines** (a "rugby 7s" team) **even when normally spelled out in the main body of storie**s (the sport "rugby sevens"). See [numbers in headlines](/home/n/numbers#inheadlines) below for more details.

**In many cases, uppercase terms that use figures** (Grade 6, Act 2, Round 3, Scene 4, 7 C) **are written out using lowercase versions** (the sixth grade, the second act, the third round, the fourth scene, seven degrees, etc.)

See also [starting sentences](/home/n/numbers#starting) below


**10 and up (general)**
**In most cases, use figures for 10 and up:**

> _The convoy included 23 trucks, 16 jeeps and 10 tanks._
>
> _Did Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, actually write all 154 sonnets?_
>
> _The 21st century began with security concerns along the 49th parallel._
>
> _The Sept. 11 attacks against the United States changed everything._
>
> _How many 30-somethings like the latest films from 20th Century Fox?_


**Ten and up** **(exceptions)**
**But there are some exceptions** (e.g., ten-pin bowling, not 10-pin, the Ten Commandments, not 10, and the Twelve Apostles, not 12).


**Starting sentences**
**Generally write out figures at the start of sentences:**

> _Eleven tanks rumbled up the hill._ (**NOT** 11 _tanks rumbled up the hill._)
>
> _Thirty people were on the boat._ (**NOT** 30 _people were on the boat._)


**It's usually best to rewrite sentences that include long numbers at the start:**

> _Medals were given to 99 soldiers._ (**NOT** _Ninety-nine soldiers received medals._)


**Ages are handled the same way.** Instead of starting a sentence with a figure, recast whenever practical:


> _Twenty-seven-year-old Jane Smith and 58-year-old John Doe both died in the crash._ (Traditional publishing style)
>
> _27-year-old Jane Smith and 58-year-old John Doe both died in the crash._ (**NOT** recommended)
>
> _Jane Smith, 27, and John Doe, 58, both died in the crash._ (Preferred)



**NOTE: Broadcast journalists** accustomed to writing scripts for the ear **sometimes overlook the value of subordinate clauses in text written for the eye.** Inserting a detail, such as an age, between commas can help keep sentences shorter.


See [ages](/home/n/numbers#ages) above for related guidelines.

**In rare cases, it's acceptable to begin sentences with figures** if spelling out would be jarring or much harder to read. **For instance, years and numbers in addresses do not have to be written out**, although it's usually best to try to rewrite whenever possible:

> _1995 was a good year for wine._
>
> _24 Sussex Drive is not far from Parliament Hill._


**Never change proper nouns to avoid figures** at the start of sentences:

> _20th Century Fox plans to release ..._ (**NOT** _Twentieth Century Fox ..._)


**Combinations (two and 11)**
**Sentences sometimes include combinations of figures and words that represent numbers:**

> _"In two minutes we'll see all 12 jurors," the guard predicted._
>
> _About 100 inmates watched Channel 7's coverage of the trial on three large TVs._


When reporting [dimensions](/home/n/numbers#dimensions), however, generally use figures across the board (e.g., 8 by 10).

**Heights, weights, etc.**
**For people, use imperial units** (feet, inches, pounds and ounces). **Otherwise, generally use metric units** (e.g., "_The dog weighed 40 kilograms_") **unless an industry standard has been entrenched** (e.g., "_The average price of gold last year was $850 per ounce_").

**We normally spell out numbers under 10.** Commas are not necessary:


> _He's six feet three inches tall and weighs 200 pounds._
>
> _She's five feet 11 inches._
>
> _The baby is nine pounds 10 ounces._


**Include hyphens when the numbers are part of an adjective:**


> _The five-foot-three-inch woman._
>
> _The seven-foot-two-inch shooting guard._


**Heights can also be expressed less formally using figures** instead of words:


> _She stands 5-10._
>
> _Half of the team is over 6-11._


Although this shorthand is sometimes expressed using an apostrophe and quotation marks (e.g., _She stands 5'10"_), **prefer a single hyphen rather than ' and " marks**, as long as the context makes the meaning (feet and inches) clear.

**Use imperial for real estate** (_2,100 square feet_), **but metric for most land size, including farms and forests**. See [imperial versus metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for more details, including when to add a metric conversion in brackets to an established imperial standard.


**Dimensions**
While details about height and weight may involve more than one unit (e.g., feet and inches), the total in each case represents a single measurement. By contrast, **the plural term "dimensions" refers to at least two separate measurements** (e.g., width and height). **Generally use the preposition "by" when reporting dimensions**, rather than symbols such as "x" or ":" _(the ratio is 16 by 9_). This is standard publishing style. It's also in line with effective broadcast script writing, since words are easier to read on air than symbols. **The main exception is web headline writing** (e.g., 8x10 is OK instead of 8 by 10 in headlines, graphics, etc.), as [outlined below](/home/n/numbers#inheadlines). Although traditional race descriptions, such as the 4x100 relay, commonly feature the "x" symbol, these are not dimensions (i.e., the first figure refers to the number of athletes each team has in the race, and the second figure refers to the distance each sprinter runs). See our [Olympics overview](/home/o/olympic-games#distance) for relevant guidelines.

**Prefer figures except in rare cases when spelled-out numbers have been established by convention**, such as lumber sizes (e.g., _the old Graflex used 4 by 5 film, but he smashed the camera with a two-by-four_).

**The relevant unit of measurement** (inch, foot, metre) **normally appears at the end** of the "by" string of figures (e.g., _the maximum size is 20 by 14 by 6 inches_), **unless it's easier to read as a series of units without the preposition "by"** (e.g., _the subway cars are roughly 23 metres long, 3 metres wide, and 4 metres high_). **Prefer words over symbols** (e.g., inches instead of ").

**Hyphens are usually added only when dimensions directly modify a noun** (_a 4-by-3 format_ versus a _ratio of 4 to 3_, an image _4 units wide by 3 units high_, etc.)

Examples of preferred ways to report common dimensions:


> _The room was 12 by 9 feet._
>
> _A 12-by-9 foot room._
>
> _The standard size is roughly 60 by 30 by 15 centimetres._
>
> _The vehicles are roughly 13 by 2.5 metres._
>
> _The new buses are 12.8 metres long, 2.6 metres wide, and 4.2 metres high._
>
> _They used four-by-fours to replace the rotting fence posts._


**In rare cases, it's unnecessary to specify units of measurement** when this detail is clearly implied:


> _She had a stack of signed 8 by 10s._
>
> _The standard printer paper is 8½ by 11._


**When adding imperial units in brackets, generally round to the nearest half unit** (e.g., 0.5 inches), unless a more precise measurement is deemed necessary for the story (e.g., in medical or scientific reporting).


> _The Mona Lisa is relatively small, at 77 by 53 centimetres (30 by 21 inches)._
>
> _The maximum size of carry-on luggage is 55 by 35 by 20 centimetres (21.5 by 13.5 by 7.5 inches)._


See **[industry standards](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#keyexceptions)** for details about building materials (e.g., **lumber is conventionally spelled out in imperial units**, such as two-by-fours), as well as certain real estate dimensions (e.g., **structure and room sizes are still commonly reported in feet** rather than metres). See [imperial versus metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for general guidelines.


**Arabic versus roman**
**Use arabic, **not** roman, numerals except in rare cases** (e.g., when referring to popes, the monarchy, and some other nouns widely assigned such sequential designation):

> _Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Pope John XXIII, Australia II_ (yacht), _LAV III_ (armoured vehicle), _The Godfather, Part II_ (film), _SALT II_ (strategic arms limitation talks), _Vatican II_ (Second Vatican Council)


Although _WW I_ and _WW II_ are allowed in stories that feature these common abbreviations in their web headlines, we generally prefer [First World War and Second World War](/home/w#WW1WW2) in all other cases.
**Do not assume a proper noun includes roman numerals.** While the official names of some vessels and films do, for instance, most feature standard arabic numerals:

> _Bluenose II_ **but** _QE2_ (Queen Elizabeth 2)
>
> _Rocky IV_ **but** _Stuart Little 3_


**Ordinal figures (1st, 2nd, 3rd)**
**In most cases, ordinal numbers below 10 are spelled out:**

> _It was the **first** time she flew in a plane._
>
> _He groaned after the **second** strike was called._
>
> _He placed **third** in the men's 1,500 metres._


**Common exceptions** are proper nouns, such as book or film titles, as well as certain nouns traditionally treated as names, such as military units:

> _The **2nd** Field Artillery Regiment_
>
> _The U.S. **7th** Fleet_


**For most ordinals above nine, use figures:**

> _Not a bad way to begin her **18th** year._
>
> _They're members of the **47th** Highlanders of Canada_


**Common exceptions** are extremely large figures (e.g., a millionth, billionth) and proper nouns, such as book and film titles:

> _He borrowed a copy of Graham Green's The **Tenth** Man._
>
> _They watched a Miracle on **34th** Street for the **millionth** time._


When abbreviating, leave out the ordinal notation (st, nd, rd, th) in [standard date constructions](/home/a/abbreviations#dates): 

> _July 2, 2011_
>
> _Oct. 8, 2013_


The exception for dates is when a sentence's syntax requires this additional detail, such as in a prepositional clause:

> _Before the 2nd of July..._
>
> _On the 8th of October..._


See also [addresses](/home/a/addresses) (11th Street not Eleventh Street), [numbers in headlines](/home/n/numbers#inheadlines) (8th not eighth), and "uncommon [fractions](/home/n/numbers#fractions)" (33/100ths).

**Fractions**
**Decimal points are a convenient way to express many fractions. Use them unless English convention calls for a solidus (/) or a written-out form.**

> _5.5 million bushels_ (instead of 5½ or five-and-a-half)
>
> _$8.25 billion_ (instead of 8¼ or eight-and-a-quarter)
>
> _2½-year-old_ girl (instead of 2.5-year-old)
>
> _three-quarters complete_ (instead of 0.75 complete)


Bear in mind that a decimal is read as "point" when scanned, which can strongly influence which form to pick (e.g., we don't say a "two-point-five-year-old"). **So prefer decimals, even when both forms are commonly used** (as in the case of bushels and dollars above). **But avoid imposing decimals if they clash with entrenched conversational usage.**

Decimal constructions always feature figures. Other forms of fractions are sometimes written out. **In general, use figures for fractions when the total amount is above one.** Keep these numbers flush (i.e., do not add spaces):

> _4¾ days_ (no hyphen)
>
> _3½-year-old boy_ (hyphens needed in adjectives, but only after the flush figures)


**Write out most other common fractions, such as one-third and one-half:**

> _two-thirds of the carton_
>
> _three-quarters finished_


NOTE: It's common to write "a" instead of "one" in some fractions (e.g., _one-third_ or a _third_ are equally acceptable in many cases). It's also common and OK to drop "a" or "one" in some fractions involving the word "half" (e.g., _half of the delegates, half a cup of flour_).

**Use figures for uncommon fractions, even when the total amount is below one:**

> _5/8ths_ (numbers flush to letters)
>
> _33/100ths_ (numbers flush to letters)


**Use figures if established by convention or part of a typographically acceptable proper noun:**

> _24/7_ (for 24 hours a day, seven days a week)
>
> _Lotto 6/49_



**Per cent**
**Write per cent** (two words, never percent) Use % only in headlines

> _They sell more than 40 per cent of their products over the internet._
>
> _They're expecting a 10 per cent increase._ (No hyphens required. See [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens))


**Write words, not figures, for percentages under 10, unless these are fractions:**

> _Interest rates rose by three percentage points._
>
> _Support grew by 5.5 percentage points._


(See also [symbols](/home/n/numbers#symbols))

**Since the term per cent indicates a collective amount, use "less" not "fewer" when referring to quantity:**

> _Less than 40 per cent of students finished the exam. Fewer than two in 10 passed._


(See also [fewer versus less](/home/f/fewer-versus-less))

**Be sure to observe the difference between** [**per cent** and **percentage**](/home/p/per-cent-versus-percentage)


**Large numbers**
In broadcast journalism, we often write out all big numbers in scripts because these are easier to read on-air: "_ten thousand dollars._" **Online, we spell out the words million, billion and trillion, but not thousand, based on established publishing conventions designed to make scanning text easier:**

_15,000 fans, 10 million records, six million litres, $2.5 billion_

**Use commas to indicate thousands, except in years, page numbers or sets of figures used solely for identification** (such as serial numbers, [phone numbers](/home/p/phone-numbers) and street [addresses](/home/a/addresses)):

> _1,000_
>
> _2004_ (year)
>
> _1582 Inukshuk Ave._
>
> _She ran along the 3600 block of Centre Street._
>
> _416-205-2464_ (phone number)
>
> page _1103_


**Do not use unfamiliar terms, such as "quintillion" or even "quadrillion."** Instead, write a million billion, a billion billion, etc. to make it clear to our readers what we're talking about.


**Money**
Here are some main points. A link to more detailed guidelines appears below.

**In online journalism, use figures (not words like "thousand" or "hundred thousand") for amounts up to $999,999:** _$5, $123.50, $70,000, $1 million, $12 billion
_
**On the web, generally use the $ sign instead of writing out "dollar."** But small amounts (under $10) can be written as either _$2_ or _two dollars_. (See [symbols](/home/n/numbers#symbols) for other examples.) **Include the abbreviation US** (with no periods) **at the end when you want to indicate American currency** (_$250 US_).

**Canadian currency is normally implied. When a story mentions other countries' dollars** (U.S., Australian, etc.) **specify "Canadian dollars" by using the abbreviation "Cdn"** (with no period except at the end of a sentence).

For specific examples, as well as tips on everything from monetary conversions to the use of words such as euro or franc, see [**money**](/home/m/money)


**Miscellaneous**
Occasionally numbers can represent something on their own without related words providing context. For instance, while calling 911 is a synonym for requesting help, and batting 1,000 is a synonym for having a perfect record, the meanings are clarified by the verbs "call" and "bat." But in an expression such as a [420 rally](/home/f#420) the jargon "420" on its own might not automatically convey the meaning ("marijuana use") to our entire audience. In such cases, a definition or additional context may be required to ensure the story is clear.

For some other uses of numbers, see [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) (dates and addresses), [aircraft names](/home/a/aircraft-names), [chemical names](/home/c/chemical-names) (CO2), [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial), [military forces](/home/m/military-forces), [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks), [phone numbers](/home/p/phone-numbers) (0, 911, etc.), [temperatures](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#temperatures) (3 C, etc.), [time](/home/t/time#1950s) (1950s, etc.), and [weapons](/home/w/weapons) (.22-calibre rifle, 9-mm pistol, etc.)


**Numbers in headlines**
The following guidelines apply to web headlines, subheads, graphics, bulleted lists, and so forth:

**Generally use figures** (even under 10 or when normally spelled out in common terms, such as four-by-four vehicle). **The numbers can be placed anywhere** (beginning, middle or end) **and be cardinal** (1, 2, 3) **or ordinal** (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

> _3 die in Via train crash_
>
> _China confirms 8th SARS death_
>
> _Why a 2nd wave of COVID-19 is more dangerous than it looks_
>
> _Sabres hand Leafs 1st loss at ACC in 13 games_
>
> _Rugby 7s team set for Commonwealth Games_
>
> _Halifax police scour 4x4 for murder clues_


**Writers and editors do have a degree of discretion when handling numbers in headlines**, subheads, decks, etc. For instance, **sometimes it's either clearer or less jarring to spell them out**:

> _one of the reasons_
>
> _two-state solution_
>
> _one-two punch_

Such **exceptions are rare**, however. **Factors to consider are headline length, clarity, tone and conversational flow.** For instance, the word "one" in an expression such as "one of the reasons" instead of "1 of the reasons" is arguably a more natural choice in a headline based on conventional usage. And going with a "one-two punch" rather than a 1-2 punch avoids the possibility of the figures being misread as a "12" punch. In the case of ordinals, **spelled-out numbers occasionally better convey specific or unique meanings** (e.g., Second Amendment refers to gun rights in the U.S. rather than to a designated "2nd" spot within a numerical sequence).


**Familiar symbols are often OK** to save space. For instance, **always use %** for "per cent" and **sometimes use x** for "by" if context is clear:

> _Inflation falls to 1% in March_
>
> _Signed 8x10 Apollo 11 photo sells for $50K_
>
> _Did a 2x4 save B.C. man from bear?_


(For general guidelines on two-by-four versus 2x4, see [dimensions](/home/n/numbers#dimensions) above)


**Use K** (for thousand) **for racing distances when entrenched as a label. Keep the figure and the capital letter flush:**

> _Bekele breaks Olympic record in 5K win_


(See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#sports) for more details on related sports style)

**Use K** (for thousand), **M** (for million), **B** (for billion) and **T** (for trillion) **after financial figures. Leave out the spaces between the currency sign** ($, €), **the number, the uppercase letter:**

> _No small change: From surplus to $85B deficit_
>
> _Nortel projects $175M loss_
>
> _NFL fines player $10K for uniform violation_
>
> _Canada's population tops 35 million_


**In business headlines, use Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 to specify a fiscal year's quarter:**

> _Inco stuns analysts with Q3 profits_

**ob-gyn** (obstetrics and gynecology), as in ob-gyn groups, ob-gyn research; **ob-gyns** (obstetricians and gynecologists), as in "ob-gyns disagree." Generally avoid both short forms except when space is at a premium (e.g., in web headlines or in TV graphics), since they're neither conversational nor widely used. The "o" is capitalized only at the start of sentences of headlines ("Ob-gyns back over-the-counter birth control" but "Pap tests at age 25 too late say ob-gyns").

**off (as a suffix)**
**When "off" falls at the end of a compound, a space turns the noun into a verb:** blastoff (n.), blast off (v.), cutoff (n.), cut off (v.), layoff (n.), lay off (v.), payoff (n.), pay off (v.), playoff (n.), play off (v.), sendoff (n.), send off (v.), standoff (n.), stand off (v.), stopoff (n.), stop off (v.), takeoff (n.), take off (v.)

**off of** – _Avoid this construction_, unless you're transcribing a direct quote. There is no need for the second preposition. So write **off the coast** (_not_ "off of") and **off her wrist** (_not_ "off of"). Sometimes, **from** is better than "off." For instance, "stole (or borrowed or took) it from him" (_not_ "off of him" or "off him").

[offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language) guidelines (fuck versus f--k, etc.)

**office, government office**, _but_ **Home Office** and **Foreign Office** (both in the [U.K.](/home/u/united-kingdom)) In long proper nouns, it's OK to move or drop the word "Office"  to keep writing tight (e.g., the **Manitoba Office of the Fire Commissioner** can be shortened to the Manitoba Fire Commissioner Office or simply the **Manitoba Fire Commissioner**), as long as the original meaning remains clear.

**oilfield, oilpatch, oilsands** (one word) Use the term [**oilsands** instead of tarsands](/home/o/oilsands-versus-tarsands)

**Ojibway** (singular and plural) For consistency, prefer this increasingly common [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) over variants, including "-wa" and "-we" endings. "Ojibway" is the most common spelling found in the First Nations Gazette. It's also recommended by several Ojibway colleagues who suggested the CBC abandon CP's "-wa" version. We shifted to the "y" spelling in the summer of 2017, after consulting the CBC Indigenous unit.

**OK** (_not_ okay), **OK's** (v.) **OK'd, OK'ing** (The noun "OKs," without an apostrophe, is an archaic synonym for "endorsements." When writing the verb OK's — which means "approves" — follow the Canadian Oxford and add an apostrophe, as in the following headline: "PM OK's plan to cut taxes") Although the slang expression **okey dokey** is spelled in various ways, use two y's and no hyphen for consistency.

*Old Testament****

**old-time, old-timer**

**oligarch, oligarchs** (n.) Members of a small number of extremely wealthy people with significant political influence in a country (e.g., **Russian oligarchs**). Usually does not need to be explained in stories because the term is entrenched and widely understood. The related and older word **oligarchy**, coined in the 1500s, was originally defined as government by a small number of people. But the terms oligarchy and oligarch have since evolved to include the more figurative sense of colossal political influence and power by a wealthy elite, often operating behind the scenes.

**Olympic Games**
the Olympic Games, the Olympics, the Winter Olympic Games, the Summer Olympic Games, the Winter Olympics, the Summer Olympics; in second reference: the Games, the Winter Games, the Summer Games (See also [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games) for detailed style points, such as abbreviations for race distances and athletes' final times.)

**Olympus, Greece** (not "Olympos," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**ombudsman, ombudsmen, ombudsperson**, Canadian taxpayers' **ombudsman** Sherra Profit, etc. Lowercase because it's treated as a [job title](/home/t/titles) rather than as a proper noun, along the lines of a company president or a university professor. The word means "people's representative" in Scandinavian. Although various gender-neutral forms have been proposed in English over the years (e.g., **ombud,** ombuds and **ombudsperson**), there's no consensus on the best approach and, so, the original term remains relatively entrenched: **Canada Post's ombudsman**, the **Canadian Forces ombudsman**. When reporting on specific people or offices, generally prefer the official title used (e.g., the **B.C. ombudsperson** versus the **New Brunswick ombud**). Capitalize proper nouns when used in full (e.g., the **Association of Canadian College and University Ombudspersons,** the **Organization of News Ombudsmen**, the **International Ombudsman Institute**). In generic references, a gender-neutral form is OK (e.g., Northern Ireland's **police ombud** rather than its police ombudsman), along the lines of the word "chair" instead of chairman or chairwoman. For clarity and consistency in such cases, distinguish between **ombud** (singular) and **ombuds** (plural), as in "the ombud said" and an "ombud complaint," but "both provinces' ombuds endorsed the report").

**omelette** (_not_ omelet)

**on-demand** (adj.) on-demand content, on-demand viewing; **on demand** (adverbial phrase) the content is available on demand; viewing it on demand

**OneBC** A political party created in British Columbia in 2025.

**one-hitter** (see also [baseball terms](/home/b/baseball))

**one-time** (hyphen) The adjective can mean "former" (a one-time jazz singer) as well as "only once" (a one-time payment)

**online** (always one word when referring to the internet) Unlike the adverb "on air" ("They went on air") and the adjective "on-air" (an "on-air report), the compound online is fused ("They went online" and "online news") See [dropping hyphens in compounds](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#compounds) for details.

**online shaming** (no hyphen) See [shaming](/home/s#shaming)

**on-camera, on-screen** (adj., adv.) _An off-camera kiss. They fought off-camera. An on-screen romance. Their love affair blossomed on-screen._ But when "on" is functioning as a preposition before a noun like camera or screen, leave out the hyphen (e.g., "_The performance was better live than on screen_").

**on-site, off-site** (adj.)

**onstage, offstage** (adj. and adverb) These words almost always take fused forms. See [onstage versus on stage](/home/o/onstage) for details.

**Ontario (Ont.), Ontarian** (resident of Ontario); Using the abbreviation Ont. in web headlines is optional (See [provinces, territories and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities))
**Ontario Health Insurance Plan** (_avoid_ the regional abbreviation OHIP in stories because it's not widely known outside the province)
**
Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation** (_not_ Corp.) **OLG** is fine in second reference, but prefer more recognizable wording (e.g., **Ontario Lottery**) in headlines. See also [Corp. versus Corporation](/home/c/corporation) for general guidelines.

**Ontario Provincial Parliament** (also known as the **Legislative Assembly of Ontario**) Neither of these longer names is necessary in news coverage. **Ontario Legislature** is fine, even in first reference. The nickname **Queen's Park** is fine in second reference, as long as the story's context is clear for people outside Ontario. (See also [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies) for related guidelines, including capitalization style)

**Ontario Provincial Police** (**OPP** fine in headlines and leads as long as the abbreviation is clearly defined in the next few paragraphs, but _prefer_ "the provincial police" in stories written for a national audience) See [police forces](/home/p/police-forces)

**Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan** (includes apostrophe), **the pension plan, the teachers' plan**, etc. See also [false possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for general guidelines on why the apostrophe is dropped in certain constructions.

**OPEC** (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) _Avoid writing "OPEC countries," which is redundant._ Try "OPEC members," "the world's big oil exporters," "the cartel," etc. OPEC had five members when founded in 1960, including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. As of 2022, it had 13 members. The cartel's head office has been in Vienna since 1965, even though Austria is not part of organization. Distinguish between **OPEC** and **non-OPEC oil producers** when relevant to a given story. For instance, Canada and the U.S. are non-OPEC producers. In 2016, the name **OPEC+** (pronounced "OPEC plus") was coined. OPEC+ refers to a loose alliance of roughly two dozen OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, including Russia and Mexico. They formally work together to control world oil prices by setting and meeting production quotas. It's OK to use the term OPEC+, but the name should be briefly explained (e.g., "OPEC and OPEC allies") if the meaning is not already clear from context.  (See also [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms))

**opening ceremony, opening ceremonies, opening night**, etc. (lowercase)

****openness****

**out (as a prefix)**
outbid, outboard, outbox, outfield, outpatient, outtake (film)


**out (as a suffix)**
**When "out" falls at the end of a compound, a space turns the noun into a verb:** fadeout (n.), fade out (v.), fallout (n.), fall out (v.), hideout (n.), hide out (v.), pullout (n.), pull out (v.), shootout (n.), shoot out (v.), shutout (n.), shut out (v.), takeout (n.), take out (v.), walkout (n.), walk out (v.), etc.

**WARNING: THIS ENTRY CONTAINS COARSE CONTENT**

**Overview**

Our Journalistic Standards and Practices (JSP) policy governing language and taste is broad. It reflects shifting societal mores, evolving English usage, etc.

**We generally:**

-   **Discourage gratuitous use of language that's likely to offend large segments of our audience.**

-   **Mask the most objectionable words with bleeps on air and with hyphens online.**

**"Gratuitous"** in this context doesn't merely mean casual or vacuous vulgarity. It also means language that's unnecessary if a paraphrase or alternative wording conveys virtually the same detail as effectively. For instance, it's normally sufficient to report that an athlete has been suspended for yelling "a homophobic slur" during a game without actually specifying that he said "[faggot](/home/l/lgbt#homophobic-slurs)," or that the N-word was painted on a door without spelling out the racist epithet.

**"Most objectionable"** is subjective but certainly includes what are euphemistically known as the F-word and the N-word.

When making decisions about coarse or explicit language, we:

-   **Take into account society's overall tolerance levels for certain words**, which tends to shift over time. In the 1950s, for instance, our news service's Directives and Style Guide told staff to avoid profane language, including "bloody," "damn" and "hell." A few decades later, such words were considered only mildly offensive, at most.

-   **Consider whether controversial remarks can be dropped altogether by paraphrasing, by picking a different clip or transcribed quote or by editing** (e.g., choosing a different start or ending). Transparently excising web text is straightforward using ellipses ("…"). By contrast, removing brief chunks of audio or video from the middle of broadcast clips can be more challenging.

-   **Acknowledge that even the most offensive language is occasionally broadcast or published uncensored** when it's editorially justified. **In these rare cases, audience warnings are required**, based on our JSP policy governing "words that shock."

-   **Recognize both broadcast and online journalism have unique properties** that are considered when we make decisions about offensive language. On-air reports, for instance, usually zip by the listeners or viewers once while online text is comparatively permanent and easily retrieved through keyword searches.
    **At the end of the day, however, the same rudimentary editorial principles apply across all of our platforms, including the need for audience warnings when necessary.** So while a broadcast report or a web article might handle, say, the use of the F-word differently from time to time, the journalists involved will have all weighed whether the language was gratuitous, and whether broadcasting or publishing in full was justified in a particular case. (See the [unique nature of each medium](/home/o/offensive-language#medium-properties) below.)

**The rest of this entry expands on the decision-making process** — from assessing how offensive certain language is from society's standpoint (mildly, moderately and highly) to handling proper nouns (e.g., the titles of films and books). **A detailed section on censoring words with hyphens is included** to address various typographical questions that have led to inconsistency in the past.


**NOTE: The verb "censor" should not be confused with the noun.** The former is commonly defined as "to make deletions or revisions," while the latter can imply something political rather than editorial (e.g., a war censor, a government censor). **In these guidelines, "censor" and "censoring" refer to bleeping audio, masking text and blurring images for journalistic reasons.**



**No list of banned words**

**Choice and tone of language is enormously important in all of the corporation's journalism because it reflects the character of CBC News.** While the Canadian Oxford Dictionary tells us how to spell, say, "motherfucker" (i.e., as a fused compound), we decide whether the word should ever appear on our website or airwaves — and, if so, under what conditions.

Vulgarity is defined as "likely to offend." Deciding what falls into that category can be subjective. **Individuals have different views about certain language.** Furthermore, **community standards change over time,** which means that there can be regional, cultural and generational divides about various expressions.

**It's not practical to proscribe a list of words and phrases that are off limits.** The relevant [Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on good taste](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Flanguage-langue-1.4523261&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw00j0MyNt5WClLhwDOEulcB) points out that we **generally avoid profanity and other coarse or explicit language "except where its omission would alter the nature and meaning of the information reported."**

**Two key questions**
When deciding whether to broadcast or publish potentially offensive material, two questions should be asked:


**1\. Is the language essential to the journalism?**

The first step in the decision-making process is determining whether the language is even necessary. Since all words should serve an editorial purpose in stories, gratuitous profanity should be axed whenever practical (e.g., by editing, paraphrasing, choosing a different clip or quote).


**2\. Is bleeping/masking required?**

**Unsuitable or problematic language falls across a spectrum.** So slightly different approaches are adopted, depending on whether the language is considered mild, moderate or extreme. A senior journalist is often involved in the decision. **Here is some general direction:**


> **MILDLY OFFENSIVE** words (e.g., **crap, piss off**), including some religious oaths (e.g., **God damn, Jesus, Christ**), should not be used indiscriminately but can be left intact when published or broadcast. When in doubt about whether a term falls into this category, check with your supervisor.
>
> **MODERATELY OFFENSIVE** words (e.g., **shit, bullshit, asshole**) normally require approval by a supervisor (senior producer or higher) before being published or broadcast. When considered important enough to a story to be used, the language is commonly spelled out in full rather than censored on the web because renderings like "s--t" can appear preciously prudish to the eye. In broadcast stories, however, programmers may decide to bleep moderately offensive content depending on various factors, including when it's being aired. Audience warnings for moderately offensive content are optional, and depend in large part on the overall impact of specific wording (e.g., a single expletive versus repeated profanity).
>
> **EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE** words (e.g., **f--k, c--t, c--ksucker, n----r**) should almost never be broadcast or published in full. When considered important enough to a story to be used, the language should generally be expurgated with hyphens online or bleeps on air. Approval for an uncensored version hinges on criteria outlined in "rare cases" below, and must be accompanied by audience warnings. Be aware that some slurs aimed at specific ethnic groups, religious groups, etc., now make many in our audience cringe (e.g., "chink" and "kike"). When in doubt about whether a term falls into this category, check with your supervisor.


**Deciding which of the above categories applies in any particular case is the first step a senior journalist takes when ruling on whether such language should be published or broadcast.**


**CASE STUDY 1:** In May 2020, the word "asshole" was used three times by a protester in Washington during live CBC News Network coverage of anti-racism demonstrations. **[Our response to an ombudsman complaint](/media/ow3hrc3o/cbcnews_coarse-language-in-tv-coverage-of-protests_reply-to-ombud-complaint_june-2020.pdf)** underscores the need to determine whether coarse or explicit language is gratuitous. It also illustrates some practical ways to assess possible shifts in society's overall tolerance for certain words.



**CASE STUDY 2:** In October 2019, we censored the word "c--t" in one story but reported the word "faggot" in another. **[Our response to an ombudsman complaint](/media/14pfs2m3/cbcnews_handling-offensive-terms-like-faggot_reply-to-ombud-complaint_nov-2019.pdf)** outlines factors we consider when bleeping or masking various words, as well as the need to include an audience warning if an [anti-2SLGBTQ+](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#preferspecific "2SLGBTQ+") slur is used.



**Censoring with hyphens**

While objectionable audio can be bleeped out in broadcast coverage, we use hyphens to mask most text (aside from photographs of signs, graffiti, etc., which are usually blurred).

As outlined above, **mildly and moderately offensive terms** (e.g., God damn, shit, asshole) **considered important to a web story should generally be used as is or not at all.**


> Jack Rabinovitch said his late wife, Doris Giller, was an unabashedly frank writer and editor. "When she saw shit, she said shit."


**But words such as fuck and cunt are almost always censored with hyphens when included in our web journalism:**


> "You all heard him. He called me a c--t," the mayor said.
>
> "If those assholes in Ottawa think they're going to take away my fishing rights with this f--ked up legislation, they're crazy."



**Proper nouns**
**This includes censoring extremely offensive words in some proper nouns,** from movie titles to the names of bands, pets and website domains, **as well as excerpts from books, lyrics, poems, etc.**, which can be communicated clearly with hyphens. Remember: Just because some person or organization has decided to use certain language for shock value doesn't mean we're required to follow suit in our coverage. This matches the spirit of cropping an explicit photo from a gallery exhibit when reporting on a particular work.


> His first film, Young People F--king, debuted at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival

> Holy F--k's second album, LP, was nominated for a Juno in 2008.


In the case of website names — including URLs that contain highly offensive language but which are deemed editorially valuable to overall coverage — the hidden HTML reference code must be left untouched in order for the link to work. The **visible hypertext** posted by CBCNews.ca, however, **can be masked with hyphens:**


> F--kingdumbpoliticians.net (_Text displayed in a story_)



> <a href="http://www.fuckingdumbpoliticians.net/"></a> (_HTML code hidden in story_)



**Clear, consistent and accurate punctuation**
**When censoring text, be sure to:**

-   **Avoid confusing readers.** Insert **one hyphen for every missing vowel or consonant** being transcribed verbatim. Do not use long dashes, asterisks or other symbols. Normally, retain only the first and last letter of root words (**e.g., f--k** rather than "f—k" or "f-ck" or "f---" or "----," **and n----r** rather than "n--ger" or
    "n---er" or "n-----" or "------"). It's OK to include one or two additional letters for clarity in some cases (e.g., "**ch--k**" instead of "c---k" for the anti-Chinese slur), but be aware that removing too many hyphens defeats the purpose. Keep prefixes or suffixes intact (e.g., **motherf--king idiot** rather than "------f--k--- idiot") because excessive omissions are harder to scan.

-   **Adopt entrenched abbreviations** (e.g., the "N-word" rather than "n-----r") if it's the most common and conversational way to refer to highly offensive language we've decided not to spell out, and which we're not quoting directly.

-   **Transcribe accurately.** If someone actually says "effing," for instance, spell out the euphemism in full rather than implying the person swore (i.e., rather than inaccurately censoring the comment as "f--king"). The same applies to terms such as "BS," "the N-word," "the F-word," and "an F-bomb."

If the offensive language being censored is transcribed from signs, placards, etc., follow relevant CBCNews.ca guidelines on [using quotation marks and capitalizing principal words](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#slogans).


**Abbreviations and euphemisms**

Mildly and moderately offensive abbreviations (e.g., SOB) do not need to be censored when spelled out ("son of a bitch"). Treat potentially offensive shorthand as already censored (e.g., snafu, WTF). Add hyphens only when spelling out the abbreviations ("Situation normal: all f--ked up" and "What the f--k?)."

Keep in mind that some euphemisms ("effing") and acronyms ("snafu") may be considered entirely inoffensive because of widespread usage (e.g., the "fu" in "snafu" has also come to mean "fouled up" over the years). By contrast, terms that are likely to offend even in the condensed (censored) form should not be used indiscriminately. And relatively obscure abbreviations (e.g., FFS and STFW) may need to be defined to aid the average reader (e.g., "For f--k's sake" and "Search the f--king web").


**Rare cases: Uncensored but extremely offensive words**

**A higher threshold must be met to justify broadcasting or publishing extremely offensive language in full.** Merely portraying a colourful scene or conveying strong emotion is not sufficient. There must also be **an identifiable public good** behind using this type of raw language, such as putting accusations against a high-ranking official into fuller context to give our audience a better understanding of key facts.


> **Example 1:** Uncensored, highly offensive language might be needed in **thorough reporting of a public inquiry if the language, itself, is central to the story** (e.g., [former Ontario premier Mike Harris repeatedly denying claims](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ipperwash-inquiry-spreads-blame-for-george-s-death-1.666937) that he said, "I want the fucking Indians out of the park," just hours before an Indigenous protester died during a clash with police in 1995).
>
> **Example 2:** Uncensored, highly offensive language might be needed **to capture the complete record of an important, historic event** (e.g., the sexually explicit descriptions in documents submitted by an independent counsel recommending the impeachment of a U.S. president). See also [lengthy transcripts](/home/o/offensive-language#transcripts) below for related guidelines on verbatim renderings.
>
> **Example 3:** Uncensored, highly offensive language might be needed **for comprehensive coverage of an important public policy debate, or for a frank conversation about a societal problem**, especially if a high-ranking political leader has uttered or written unvarnished language to convey a particular message (e.g., [U.S. President Barack Obama's use of the word "nigger" in a June 2015 interview about racism](https://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/obama-uses-n-word-to-argue-racism-is-alive-in-america-1.3123070) in his country), or if a government is being asked to revise maps or other official documents (**e.g., the debate over changing geographical names** like "Nigger Rapids" in Quebec).


**IMPORTANT: When a senior journalist authorizes publication of uncensored, highly offensive language, an audience warning must be included** (i.e., in a broadcast report's intro or at the top of an online article). This means we should **avoid including such language in headlines** or other places where advance warning cannot be incorporated effectively.


**Lengthy transcripts** (verbatim renderings)

Sometimes transcripts are published as separate documents to supplement our journalism (e.g., court proceedings and taped interviews). If the excerpts are lengthy and contain a lot of highly offensive language, it may be impractical to censor the text.

In such cases, the files can be treated as PDFs or scanned excerpts of original material. But they should be:

-   Clearly identified as verbatim transcripts.

-   Self-contained (i.e., on pages linked to but separate from CBCNews.ca stories).

-   Flagged with a warning at the top about explicit language.

**Audio and video captions**

**When we post audio or video files online that are known to contain uncensored offensive language, an effort should be made to warn our web audience about the content.** Since there are sometimes technical limitations placed on the number of characters permitted in such captions (which often function as web page promos), **the notices should be kept brief** (e.g., "WARNING: Explicit audio"). To save space, a small but clear graphical warning should be considered instead of text when possible. **The original radio or television intros should also be retained in the encoded audio or video files** if these include warnings about explicit language.


**Text inside photos**

**Sometimes offensive language can be seen in an image** (e.g., on a sign at a demonstration). **Just because this text has appeared in a video report does not automatically mean it should be posted as a photo in on CBCNews.ca**, where still pictures take on special weight.

Each case is different, and a senior journalist should be involved in the final decision. Factors to consider include:

-   The wording itself (i.e., whether it's mildly, moderately or extremely offensive).

-   How clear and prominent the text is (e.g., if it's in the background or centre stage).

-   How central the text is to the story (e.g., if removing this part of the image would make the journalism poorer).

**Cropping pictures or blurring pixels should be considered in extreme cases.**

NOTE: These guidelines deal with offensive language only. Censoring may also be called for when handling images that are graphic and disturbing (e.g., particularly violent, gruesome). Relevant Journalistic Standards and Practices policies should be followed. In the case of explicit nudity, it's also a good idea to consult with CBC legal counsel, since laws governing obscenity, pornography, etc., may apply.


**Explicit details** (e.g., sexual assault allegations)

**Sometimes the specific nature of a description can be offensive**, even when the words, themselves, are not actually crude or profane. **Particular care is needed when reporting allegations of sexual assault, obscene acts, etc.**

Once again, **the first hurdles are determining what's essential** versus what's gratuitous, **as well as what's shocking or highly offensive** (requiring an audience warning). In general, **we should avoid overly detailed accounts when virtually the same information can be conveyed by a general statement** (e.g., "She says he then reached under her dress"), **and we should limit references to specific sexual acts, body parts, body fluids, etc.** (e.g., "He's accused of unzipping his pants and masturbating"). While clinical terminology (penis, vagina) is normally considered less crude than colloquialisms, such details can sometimes be dispensed with altogether without sacrificing any meaning.

**The benefit of providing a complete picture should be weighed against the harm of graphic and disturbing details** — upsetting not only to our audience but also to the victims and their families. So **while we don't necessarily need to reduce everything to vague generalities** (e.g., "brutal physical attacks"), **we also don't need to catalogue all the horrors alleged**. Instead, we can consider defining what's meant by "brutal physical attacks" with a bit more information when it's deemed editorially necessary (e.g., "The jury was told that he videotaped many of the assaults, which included mutilation and sodomy"). But even in those cases, **always exercise restraint**. And remember to **add an audience warning** whenever specific language collides with the public's boundaries of tolerance and taste.


**CASE STUDY 3:** In May 2020, former U.S. vice-president Joe Biden denied allegations of sexual assault by a woman who worked for him in the Senate in 1993. Our coverage included the sentence, "She says … he pinned her up against the wall, started kissing her, put his hands under her clothing, and penetrated her with his fingers." **[Our response to an ombudsman complaint](/media/srdle4sf/cbcnews_description-of-allege-faca8ce400cf4067.pdf)** underscores why we felt such explicit language was necessary to tell the story. It also illustrates the nuances that are sometimes required when assessing relevance and clarity.



**Unique nature of each medium**

As pointed out in the overview, electronic publishing has introduced some unique challenges at CBC News. Posting an uncensored word such as "fuck" on the web can be different from putting it into broadcast journalism. **Senior journalists should take into account the unique nature of a given medium (TV, radio and online) when making decisions about airing or publishing offensive language.** In particular:

1\. The written word can carry a weight that is different from on-air clips (i.e., the way the text is processed by readers). Offensive language remains on the screen after the eye scans it, rather than disappearing as soon as the ear hears it.

2\. There's no blanket rule about the spoken versus written words. The impact of certain audio may depend on context, phrasing, the emotion in the voice, etc. Once stripped of a specific person's voice, transcribed quotes on the web are more closely identified with CBCNews.ca than with the original speaker. At the same time, hearing a CBC journalist utter even moderately offensive language verbatim in a broadcast script can be more jarring than reading the same words on a screen.

3\. Published text is invariably considered a deliberate editorial decision rather than as an inadvertent act. In live news broadcasting, by contrast, certain words may sometimes be spoken on the fly before it's technically possible to bleep them out.

4\. Profanity on a website is virtually permanent, and can be found quickly through word searches 24 hours a day. By contrast, broadcast reports are comparatively ephemeral. Furthermore, unlike conventional broadcasting, there is no practical way to differentiate between traditional "daytime" and "late-night" audiences, including when children are reading our online content.

5\. Bleeps are a blunt instrument in broadcast journalism. The sound can sometimes lead viewers and listeners to assume that something far worse than, say, "shitty" or "ass" was said. Unless given language is highly offensive, therefore, it's sometimes better to either pick a different clip or to leave the audio as is. Be fair to the person speaking and consider whether bleeping might actually be misleading.


**External partners**

Other websites and digital platforms displaying CBC News content may have their own standards in place for handling profanity. In general, external partners are encouraged to either post CBC News text as is or to remove the stories from their lineups. This avoids audience misunderstandings about an outside organization's decision to edit CBC News content and then publish the material as though the CBC actually deleted/altered certain wording. When in doubt about an external partner's use of CBC material, Business Affairs and/or the Law Department should be consulted to confirm the conditions of existing agreements.

### oilsands versus tarsands

**Oilsands versus tarsands**

**Use oilsands when referring to the energy deposits in northern Alberta. Reserve tarsands for directly transcribed clips.**

The word **oilsands** is considered **more neutral and more accurate** because the substance eventually refined from the extracted bitumen is oil. The word tarsands, by contrast, is founded on a simile (i.e., that the heavy, viscous oil trapped in the sand, clay and water is "tar-like"). Tar comes mainly from trees and coal.

Although oilsands and tarsands were used interchangeably for decades, the term tarsands has become closely associated with critics of the bitumen development, who consider it an environmentally harmful project as well as a dirty form of energy.

CBC News must not take sides in such disputes, and always balance coverage with as many viewpoints as possible. But our language also needs to be neutral and accurate. Just as we refer to the offspring of seals as "pups" rather than as "babies" — regardless of the wording preferred by critics of seal hunting — we refer to the bitumen reserves in Alberta as oilsands rather than tarsands, unless "tarsands" is directly attributed to a specific person or organization.

See also [**bitumen**](/home/b#bitumen), which includes a caution about the need to define the obscure term "**dilbit**" (as **diluted bitumen**).


**Spelling (oilsands but sometimes 'Oil Sands')**

The **generic term** oilsands is **one word**, along the lines of **oilfield** and **oilpatch**. This has become the standard in Canada, adopted by many news organizations, including the CBC, CP and Alberta's biggest papers.

**But the compound may or may not be fused in names**, depending on the organization's preference (e.g., **Sunshine Oilsands Ltd.** and **Alberta Oilsands Inc.** versus **Athabasca Oil Sands Corp.** and the **Oil Sands Developers Group**). When in doubt, always double-check proper nouns.

### Olympic Games

**Olympic Games**
[Overview](/home/o/olympic-games#overview) (including caveat about editorial vs. non-editorial usage)









[Miscellaneous style](/home/o/olympic-games#miscellaneous) (opening ceremony, flag-bearer, etc.)

**Overview**
**This entry is focused on our journalism. It covers a range of editorial and stylistic points that have surfaced over the years. For guidance on copyright issues, including something as basic as the use of the word "Olympics" in web addresses (URLs) and filenames when the CBC is not the official broadcaster, check with your supervisor and/or [the Law Department](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Flegal-juridique-1.3096749&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2C6aikrr0IlVx2eKzOPjfy).**

**Certain proper nouns tied to the Olympics are closely guarded by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).** Adhere to relevant first-reference and second-reference guidelines outlined below.

**Stories about specific competitions should identify winners and include relevant details early on** (e.g., top results and comparisons to Olympic or world records). Always mention Canadian participants, and look for Canadian angles.
**
Limit the number of figures you cram into a single sentence or paragraph.** When possible, feature a large group of results in a graphic.

**Avoid jargon.** If you include terms such as snowboard "chatter" (vibration) or biathlon "clicks" (small adjustments to a rifle's sights), a cycling "peloton" (group of main riders) or a rowing rig's "skeg" (stabilizing fin), be sure to define these words.


**EDITORIAL VS. NON-EDITORIAL:** Be aware that certain usage permitted in our journalism may not be allowed elsewhere. For example, while the conversational compounds '**Summer Olympics**' and '**Winter Olympics**' are OK **in second reference in news stories** based on entrenched convention (see below), the same shorthand is NOT permitted by the IOC in graphics, logos, banners, promotional material, etc. Stringent, separate guidelines cover non-editorial usage. When in doubt, ask your supervisor.


**Olympic, Olympics, Olympiad**
**In first reference** (not including headlines), **stories should generally use one of the following constructions:
**

the 2024 Olympic Games
the 2024 Paris Olympic Games
the 2024 Paris Games
the 2024 Paris Olympics
the Summer Olympics in Paris
the Summer Games in Paris

the 2022 Olympic Games
the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games
the 2022 Beijing Games
the 2022 Beijing Olympics
the Winter Olympics in Beijing
the Winter Games in Beijing

the 2020 Tokyo Olympics ([see 2021 anomaly](/home/o/olympic-games#Tokyo-2020) below)
the 2014 Olympic Games
the 2014 Sochi Olympics
the Winter Olympics in Sochi
the 2014 Sochi Olympics
the 2012 Olympic Games
the 2012 London Olympics
the Summer Olympics in London
the 2010 Vancouver Olympics
the Winter Olympics in Vancouver
the 2006 Torino Games (the event, held in [Turin](/home/t#Turin) the city)


**In plural constructions, keep all proper noun elements capitalized:**



the Summer and Winter Olympics
the Summer and Winter Games


**In some cases, a city's full name is clipped** based on entrenched usage:


the 2016 Rio Games (rather than Rio de Janeiro Games)
the Summer Olympics in Rio (rather than in Rio de Janeiro)


**In rare cases, a country's name may also be used when a** **city's name is not widely known:**



the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games
the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics
the Winter Olympics in South Korea (rather than always writing Pyeongchang)
the Winter Games in South Korea (rather than always writing Pyeongchang)



**THE 2021 ANOMALY:** Although the **2020 Summer Olympics** were postponed for a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee said the event's name would remain the same:


> the 2020 Olympic Games
>
> the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games
>
> the 2020 Tokyo Games
>
> the 2020 Tokyo Olympics


When relevant, we can briefly explain to audiences why the 2020 Games were held in 2021. But **it's inaccurate to call the Games of the 32nd Olympiad the "2021 Games."** So AVOID wording that implies an official name change.

**Keep in mind that some cities have hosted more than one Olympics** (e.g., Athens in 1896 and 2004, Lake Placid in 1932 and 1980, and Paris in 1900 and 1924). In these cases, it's often important to specify the year to ensure that the historical reference is clear. But there's no need to worry about confusion between a recent or current Olympics (e.g., the Paris Games in 2024) and an event held in the same city a century ago (e.g., the Paris Games in 1924). In other words, the **Paris Games** implies the 2024 Games. It's not considered a historical reference but, rather, is instantly identified by our audience as the name of the most recent Olympics in that city. Even when the Games are held in the same location less than a decade or two apart (e.g., the **Beijing Games**), there's rarely any danger of confusion when one was a Summer Olympics (e.g., Beijing 2008) and the other a Winter Olympics (Beijing 2022).

**While more than one community may have venues** (e.g., Vancouver and Whistler, B.C.), **the Games are almost always officially linked to a single host city by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).** Exceptions feature two city names in IOC documentation (e.g., Italy's 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics held in Milan and the Cortina d'Ampezzo ski resort several hundred kilometres away). The host city's name (Tokyo, Sochi, Vancouver, London, Athens, Calgary, Beijing) is normally straightforward. When more than one form is common (e.g., Turin and Torino, Milan and Milano), consult and follow in-house style for consistency. The use of Torino for the name of the Games and Turin for the city was adopted by CBC News and CBC Sports in 2004, as explained in a [Words: Woe & Wonder column](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fkiev-or-kyiv.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NAvZSqCruI4DyZUlkwCwM), and has been used in our journalism since. When there are competing spellings, including different approaches to capitalization, consult and follow in-house style for consistency (e.g., [Pyeongchang](/home/p#Pyeongchang)).

**In second and subsequent references**, journalists writing news stories have several options, including:

the Olympics
the Summer Olympics
the Paris Olympics
the Summer Games
the Paris Games
the Winter Olympics
the Beijing Olympics
the Winter Games
the Beijing Games
the Games

**
Headlines can be reduced further as long as the context is clear.** Here are some options:


Olympics
2020 Games
Tokyo
Beijing
Vancouver
London
Torino (refers to Games)
Turin (refers to geographical location)


See **[editorial vs. non-editorial](/home/o/olympic-games#editorial)** above for caveat about non-journalistic usage.

**Do not use the word Olympiad to mean the Games.** The term refers to a four-year period that wraps up with the Olympic Games. Use arabic not roman numerals for all olympiads (e.g., _the 21st Winter Olympiad, the Games of the 30th Olympiad_).

**The word "Olympic"** (singular) **is an adjective** (e.g., Olympic athlete, Olympic accreditation, Olympic Charter, Olympic event, Olympic Games, Olympic Organizing Committee, Olympic sites, Olympic story, Olympic Village, Olympic writers). **It's sometimes part of a compound modifier** (e.g., Olympic-size pool).

**The word "Olympics"** (plural) **is short for Olympic Games. It's normally a noun not an adjective.**


_At the Olympics, all Olympic writers in the Olympic unit had Olympic accreditation._


The **International Olympic Committee** should be spelled out once in first reference. **IOC** is fine in headlines and second reference.

**Paralympics**
**Use the same first-reference format above for the Paralympics**, such as:


> the 2022 Beijing Paralympic Games
>
> the 2022 Winter Paralympic Games
>
> the Beijing Paralympic Games
>
> the 2022 Paralympic Games


**Use the same approach to second-reference capitalization** as well:



the Paralympic Games
the Summer Paralympics
the Winter Paralympics
the Paralympics
the Games


**Capitalize the word Para on its own**, such as:


> Para archery
>
> Para badminton
>
> Para canoe
>
> Para ice hockey
>
> Para powerlifting
>
> Para snowboard
>
> Para rowing
>
> Para triathlon


This includes references to competitors (e.g., **Para judo athlete**, **Para judoka**, **Para snowboarder**, **Para swimmer**).

**Keep sports featuring more than one word all lowercase**:


> cross-country skiing
>
> wheelchair basketball
>
> wheelchair curling
>
> sitting volleyball


**Bans against countries, boycotts, etc.**
**When a country is banned from taking part in the Olympics as a nation but some of its athletes are still permitted to compete, be accurate but as conversational as possible** (e.g., "Russian athletes" rather than "Russia," and the "Russian medal count" rather than "Russia's medal count"). Include explanatory context whenever practical. For instance, at the 2022 Beijing Games and 2020 Tokyo Games, Russians competed as members of the **Russian Olympic Committee (ROC)**, and at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics they represented a group known as **Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR)**. They were not allowed to use Russia's flag or national anthem because of a punishment handed down by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

**Distinguish between different types of boycotts.** If one or more countries refuse to send anyone, including athletes, the word "boycott" on its own is fine as long as context is clear (e.g., the U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, and the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles). By contrast, the 2022 Olympics involved a **diplomatic boycott**, with Canada, the U.S., and several other countries, including the U.K. and Australia, refusing to send government representatives to the Winter Games as part of a human rights protest.


**Medals**
**Medals are always lowercase** (gold, silver and bronze).

The word **medallist has two l's.**


_She's an Olympic gold medallist._

**
Avoid using medal as a verb** (i.e., people are not _expected to medal_).

**Placements**
**When reporting results, some phrases or terms can be abbreviated.** For instance: _Canadians finished **first and second**_ or _Canadians finished **1-2**. They're now **number 1** in the world_ or _They're now **No. 1** in the world._


_Canadians finished 1-2 in the race, less than four seconds apart and more than half a minute ahead of the bronze medallist.

If the rowing team could knock three seconds off its time, it would become No. 1 in the world.

The Canadian men's volleyball team was eliminated from medal contention after being swept 3-0 by Venezuela (26-24, 25-16, 29-27)._


CBCNews.ca general guidelines governing numbers apply to sports stories on the web.

**Distance**
**Always spell out the metric measurement in first reference. Do not add hyphens unless it's a compound adjective.**


_He placed fourth in the men's 1,500 metres.

After the false start, she walked 20 metres down the track before turning around.

He sprinted past the leader about 10 metres before the finish line.

The wind was 0.7 metres per second.

_

**Adjectives**


_She won the 100-metre hurdles.

He's better known as a 200-metre runner.

Both swimmers also won bronze in the 4x100-metre medley relay.
_

**Implied measurement**
**Do not bother repeating a distance unit, such as metre, if it's implied by an earlier reference** in the story:


_Germany is favoured to win the men's 4x100 relay. She placed fifth in the women's 1,500 at the Sydney Olympics.

Canadian Lefty Lifter came in fifth in the men's shot put, throwing a personal best of 19.96 metres. Ambi Dextrous of France won with a toss of 21.74.

Canadian Marty Short placed fourth in the men's high jump, clearing 2.14 metres. Frank Tower of Australia jumped 2.4 to win the gold._

**
Do not add zeros to decimal places when the ciphers are implied** (e.g., use _2.4_ not _2.40 metres_) **except in rare cases when established by convention** (e.g., _"Under the old judging system, a perfect score was 6.0"_).

**Metric terms**
**In first reference, measurements are normally spelled out** (metres, kilometres, kilograms, etc.). **Metric abbreviations do not include periods or an "s"** (matching our style for other common shorthand, such as 20 _km/h_ and 8_\-mm_ film). **Always add a space between the figure and the abbreviation:**


_Olympic welterweight boxers (63.5-67 kg) will begin competing Thursday._

or

_Olympic welterweight boxers weigh between 63.5 and 67 kilograms._

**
Letters representing short metric distances, such as "m," are optional but generally unnecessary for a Canadian audience.**They're often found in wire stories written for a U.S. market, which is more accustomed to imperial measurements. (But compare to 5K, 10K below.)

**First reference**

> _He also competed in the men's 4x100-metre relay at the 2000 Olympics._

**Second and subsequent references**

> _Both men also ran in the 4x100 relay at the 2000 Olympics._


**Leave out the abbreviation "m"** (e.g., 4x100 m relay) in second reference because it's implied.

**Headline shorthand**

******In headline writing, the metric unit is also generally dropped** to save space:

****

> _4x100 relay: The fear of screwing it up_

****
**50K, 10K, 5K**
When referring to long-distance events, **a capital K is often used to represent kilometres**. Type it flush to the figure**** (an exception to the general rule, based on long-established convention).

> _10,000-metre race
> __10-kilometre race
> __10K_

****
**Height and weight (of athletes)**
Although **boxing categories are measured in kilograms** (see metric terms above), **use imperial terms when describing other athletes:**

****

_Broder stood six foot three and weighed 198 pounds._

****
Or if it's clear from the context:

****

_Broder, 6-3, weighed 198 pounds_

****
Or, using an adjective:

****

_The six-foot-three swimmer weighed 198 pounds._

******Avoid mixing imperial and metric measurements in one sentence****** (e.g., T_he six-foot-three swimmer splashed into the lead in the last 15 metres of the race._)******Instead, recast into two sentences.**

**Time**
**0:27.55**  (_represents 27.55 seconds_)
**3:37.23** (_represents three minutes 37.23 seconds_)
**1:48:24.02** (_represents one hour 48 minutes 24.02 seconds_)

**When the duration of a sports event first appears in a story, spell out hours, minutes and seconds. Do not include commas** between the various time elements.

****

_Wong crossed the finish line in one hour 44 minutes 23.05 seconds._

******
Subsequent time references can be abbreviated******, with colons signalling hours and minutes and a decimal point indicating tenths and hundredths of a second. If you end a sentence with a figure, be sure to include the period.

_She won a silver medal in the women's 5,000 metres, finishing in 14 minutes 29.11 seconds, less than five seconds behind the world record of 14:24.68.

He placed fifth in the men's 1,500 metres with a time of 3:46.72.

Mary Thon of Kelowna, B.C., came in fourth in the women's 800 with a time of 1:59.99. McKee came in second, with a time of 1:48:24.02.

She ran the 100 metres in 11.46 seconds._

******
It's often more natural to spell out all times under one minute****** (e.g., 13.52 seconds_instead of 0:13.52_, and 8-100ths of a second_instead of 0:08_), ****unless one paragraph contains a cluster of results.****See also [sports](/home/s/sports-overview) (for links to terms not tied to the Olympics, such as football and golf).
******Opening ceremony, flag-bearer, etc.**
CBCSports.ca writers follow the same guidelines for [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization), [numbers](/home/n/numbers), [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation), [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations), [metric abbreviations](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial), [spelling](/home/s/spelling),**** etc., as other CBC journalists working online. This means, for example, that **_flag-bearer_** has a hyphen; that **_opening ceremony_** is lowercase; and that **_figure skating_** and **_speed skating_** are two words as nouns but hyphenated as adjectives, as in a **_figure-skating jump_**.

### oilsands versus tarsands

**One of the**

There are **three common pitfalls with "one of the"** constructions:

**1\. Verbosity.** A sentence such as "One of the reasons for her departure" is usually clearer and stronger when shortened (e.g., "One reason for her departure …").

**2\. Subject-verb disagreement** when the writer or speaker wrongly assumes that the singular "one" governs a later clause. **Examples of CORRECT usage:** "**He is one of the few people over 60 who have** \[not has\] **climbed Mount Everest,"** and "**She is one of the tenants in the building who love** \[not loves\] **taking the stairs."** The quick test is to reverse the order of each sentence: "Of the few people over 60 who have climbed Mount Everest, he is one," and, "Of the tenants in the building who love taking the stairs, she is one." In each case, the subject governing the verb in question is plural (people and tenants).

**3\. Lack of parallel structure when a subordinate clause** **is added.** **Example of a TYPICAL ERROR**, especially in spoken English: **"She is one of the best, if not the best, singers in the choir."** The flaw here is that the clause "if not the best" requires a singular noun (i.e., "if not the best singer"). At the same time, "one of the best" demands a plural noun (i.e., "one of the best singers"). **The quickest solution is either to remove the subordinate clause or to recast** (e.g., **"She is one of the best, if not the best, of the singers in the choir,"** or "**She is one of the best singers in the choir, if not the best**," or "She is possibly the best singer in the choir").


**One of the only**

**No entry on "one of the" is complete without addressing "one of the only," a common construction that's much maligned and yet demonstrably OK.** While some writers and editors prefer alternative phrasing, such as **"one of the few,"** it really boils down to a stylistic choice rather than a matter of grammar.

**It's a myth that the word "only" must automatically be tied to the figure "one"** (i.e., to a single person, a single object, etc.). For instance, if only three people show up to a party — despite dozens of invitations — then the word "only" refers to the three guests who came. In that case, the phrasing **"one of the only people"** as well as "**one of the few people**" would both mean "**one of the three people**" who attended.

It's worth noting that talking and writing conversationally can include something known as "scalar implicature" in linguistics. This jargon refers to the implicit rather than the literal meaning of various numbers, sizes, etc., as well as to the intentional use of an ambiguous term (e.g., "some") instead of more specific phrasing. It's also worth remembering that **"one of only"** (sans the definite article "the") is frequently used without comment or complaint (e.g., **"One of only three skaters"**). Revising this wording slightly (e.g., **"One of the only skaters,"** which simply means "**One of the few skaters**") is neither jarring nor problematic.

At the end of the day, **"one of the only" is deeply entrenched,** dating back centuries, **widely understood, and violates no rules of standard English.**


**One of the finest, one of the best**

Related "superlative" constructions (e.g., finest, best) are not inherently at odds with the word "one," either. The 2015 New Fowler's Modern English Usage cites **"one of the finest poems"** and **"one of the best books"** as examples of common, acceptable usage. Yes, such sentences could be recast as "one of the finer" and "one of the better." But such rewrites are optional. They also come at a cost in some writers' eyes, since the comparative adjectives "finer" and "better" do not stress the stellar nature of the poems or books in the same way.

### onstage

**Onstage versus on stage**

The word onstage is both an adjective and an adverb. For this reason, it's almost always the correct choice:


**ONSTAGE (adjective)**

> _The onstage performance included dry ice and pyrotechnics._
>
> _She is still recovering from an onstage accident in Calgary last month._
>
> _"Let's keep onstage nudity above the waist," he warned._


**ONSTAGE (adverb)**

> _They stumbled onstage 15 minutes late._
>
> _"Onstage, everyone!" shouted the director._
>
> _The band was onstage when the fire started._


Adverbs wear many hats. In the above case, they're indicating place. In the first sentence, there's a specific action. "Where did they stumble?" Onstage. In the second sentence, the verb "go" is implied but missing. "\[Go\] onstage, everyone!" In the third sentence, there's additional information supplied about a "to be" verb (i.e., "was"). "Where was the band when the fire started?" Onstage.


**ONSTAGE, OFFSTAGE, BACKSTAGE**
Since offstage and backstage are also adjectives and adverbs, a good rule of thumb is to substitute them in your head to confirm that the fused word "onstage" works:

_They were onstage when gunshots rang out.
They were offstage when gunshots rang out.
They were backstage when gunshots rang out._

_
The booing began as they walked onstage.
The booing began as they walked offstage.
The booing began as they walked backstage._


**ON STAGE (two words)
**
In some sentences, "on" can function as a preposition before the noun "stage." It's generally a more wordy construction, such as:

> _They were on the small, cramped stage when the fire started._


Unless the preposition "onto" is chosen, however, you normally have the option to treat onstage as a fused word:

> _They ran onto the stage._
>
> _They ran on the stage._
>
> _They ran onstage._ (cleanest and preferred)


Compare with [on-camera, on-screen](/home/o#on-screen)
For related guidelines, see also [onto versus on to](/home/o/onto-versus-on-to)

### onto versus on to

**Onto versus on to**

Some writers always use "on to," but they're ignoring a useful distinction that many language authorities encourage observing.


**ONTO**
**When "on" functions as a preposition immediately in front of "to," the words should be joined into a single, fused preposition. This is usually the case with movement that puts people or things on top of a specific physical location.**

_"We walked onto the runway,"_ for instance, means that we stepped on the runway.

A quick test reveals both words are needed in this construction. If you drop either ("on" or "to"), the sentence's meaning changes.

_"We walked to the runway"_ says nothing about being on it.
_"We walked on the runway"_ says nothing about how you got there.


**ON TO**
**When "on" functions as an adverb, it should be kept separate from "to."** In these cases, "to" alone is the preposition introducing the next phrase.

_"We walked on to the runway,"_ for instance, means that we kept walking up to the runway but didn't necessarily step onto the tarmac.

Dropping "on" in this case changes the meaning only slightly. ("We walked to the runway.") Although the notion of walking farther is lost, the essence of the sentence remains — a good indication that "on" and "to" should be kept separate.

Note: **If the words "on to" are not fused, "on" frequently means something other than a physical location.** It could, **for example**, suggest **awareness**: "We're on (wise) to your tricks." Or, it could mean **continuation**: "We drove on (farther) to the next town."

It's now time to move on to something else.

### Opposition

**Opposition versus opposition**

**Capitalize “opposition” only when referring to the Official Opposition in Parliament, a provincial legislature, etc.** (i.e., the non-governing party with the most number of seats).

the Official Opposition
the Opposition party
the Opposition leader
Opposition leader Jill Wong
Conservative Leader Jill Wong (See [Leader versus leader](/home/l/leader))

**Otherwise, keep the generic word “opposition” lowercase:**

the opposition parties
the opposition is growing

_The MP spent her career in **opposition**, but she was never actually a member of the **Official Opposition**._

### Order of Canada

**Order of Canada**

The awards were first handed out on Canada’s 100th birthday (July 1, 1967).

**There are three levels. All of them are lowercase when spelled out.** In descending (highest to lowest) order these are:

**companion of the Order of Canada** (do _not_ use abbreviation CC)
**officer of the Order of Canada** (do _not_ use abbreviation OC)
**member of the Order of Canada** (do _not_ use abbreviation CM)


The above abbreviations frequently appear in people’s biographical blurbs. _When mentioning a specific level of the Order of Canada in a news story, spell it out._ Note: CM was chosen for “member” because MC (Military Cross) was already in use.

Only so many people can be appointed to each category in a given year. The highest level has an additional limit. There can be no more than a total of 165 living companions at any time.

**Order of Canada is uppercase only when written in full.**

Order of Canada medal
companion of the order
the order


**Other common constructions in news stories:**


They've been appointed to the _Order of Canada._
He was made an officer of the _Order of Canada._
She was elevated to the highest level, a _companion of the order._
_The order’s medal_ is in the shape of a snowflake.


Twice a year, the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada meets to consider nominations for these honours. The council then passes its recommendations on to the Governor General, who actually makes the appointments.

The Governor General's website has more information about the [Order of Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gg.ca%2Fdocument.aspx%3Fid%3D14940&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ZCGd-WawYzI9h6Kvvw-ca), including the names of members, officers and companions.

**P**

**[ph-pq](/home/p#ph)**

**[pr-py](/home/p#pr)**

**p-pg**
**Pablum** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a soft baby cereal); **pablum** (anything bland over oversimplified); **pabulum** (food, especially "nourishment for the mind")

****Pacific Ocean, Pacific****

**pacifism, pacifist** (opposed to violence, war, etc.) The word **pacify** refers to peace. Do _not_ confuse with [passive](/home/p#passive), which refers to inaction or lack of emotion.

**pact** (lowercase except with proper names) **Munich Pact, Warsaw Pact, Pact of Paris,** _but_ **auto pact** (which was officially called the 1965 Canada-U.S. Automotive Products Trade Agreement)

**paddy wagon** (do not use; considered offensive to some Irish people) Prefer **police van** or **police wagon**. For details and related guidelines, see: [gyp, Indian summer, paddy wagon, etc.](/home/g/gyp)

**page 5, pages 7-9** (For related guidelines, see [series](/home/n/numbers#series) in the numbers overview) Generally limit use of abbreviation (**pp. 7-9**) to graphics, etc.

**Pakistan Peoples Party** (no apostrophe in this proper noun) See also [false possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for related guidelines

**paleontologist, paleontology** (_not_ palae-)

**Palestinian Authority** (includes administrative and legislative body, based out of Ramallah); **Palestinian Legislative Council**, also known as the **Palestinian parliament** (See [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies) for related capitalization style guidelines); **Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)**. The [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority) includes relevant background and guidelines, including why we continue to use the noun "Palestinian Authority," despite a potentially confusing name change adopted by the PA, itself, in January 2013.

**Palestinian territories** (see the [**Middle East glossary**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestine) for guidelines on limited use of the noun "Palestine" versus the descriptive compound "Palestinian territories").

**pallbearer** (one word)

**Palm Pilot>**

**Palma de Mallorca** (Spanish city on an island in the western Mediterranean) The clipped form, **Palma**, is OK, even in first reference, if the context makes the meaning clear. Be aware that the resort's official name has flipped between Palma de Mallorca and Palma several times. Local residents prefer Palma. But the longer version is entrenched in English, and helps distinguish the city from similar proper nouns (e.g., La Palma, which is part of the Canary Islands). Palma de Mallorca is a fusion of the city name (Palma) and the geographical location (the island of Mallorca, which is spelled "Majorca" in Spanish). Mallorca, in turn, is part of a Spanish archipelago called the Balearic Islands.

****panacea****

**Panama Canal** but **panama hat**

**panda** (a noun that describes a few different species) Some pandas are considered bears. Others are viewed more like raccoons. Part of the zoological complexity stems from whether scientists are focused on bone structure, DNA, behaviour, etc. Be aware, therefore, that the construction "**panda bear**" can be problematic outside of directly transcribed clips, depending on the animal in question. For this reason, it's often simpler to use a specific modifier in first reference (e.g., **giant panda, red panda**), depending on the facts, and then to use the word **panda** alone in second reference.

**pandemic** (See [endemic, epidemic, pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic))

**panel, panellist, panelling** (note the double l) The generic word panel is virtually always lowercase, even when governments, private companies and others mint fancy names for advisory groups. The publishing convention is to treat these as descriptive compounds rather than as proper nouns (e.g., Ontario's **autism advisory panel**, B.C.'s **expert money-laundering panel**, Ottawa's **panel on sustainable finance**). Quotation marks are sometimes used to flag a given government's branding (e.g., **Alberta's "fair deal" panel** was set up in 2019 to to examine whether the province should move toward a more independent role within Canada).

Pangnirtung (a hamlet in Nunavut)

**Panjwaii** (an area in the province of Kandahar, Afghanistan, known as **Panjwaii district**) For consistency, do not use any of the alternative spellings, such as Panjwaye, Panjway, or Panjwayi. (See also [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations))

****pantyhose****

**papal, papacy** (see [Pope versus pope](/home/p/pope))

**paparazzi** (plural), **paparazzo** (singular) It's clearer to say _a member of the paparazzi rather than a paparazzo_.

****paper, paperback, paper clip, paperweight****

**paper-boy, paper-girl** (_Avoid these terms_ unless you're referring to a boy or girl. _Prefer_ **paper carrier**, especially since the person may actually be an adult of either sex.)

****Pap smear, Pap test****

**Papua New Guinea** (no hyphen)

**parachute jumping** (no hyphen) See also [BASE jumping](/home/b#BASEjumping)

**parade, Santa Claus parade, Calgary Stampede parade, Toronto Pride parade**, etc.

**paragraph 6** (for related guidelines, see [series](/home/n/numbers#series) in the numbers overview)

****parallel, paralleled, 49th parallel****

**Paralympic Games, the Paralympics** (**the Games** OK in second reference) See also [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games)

**paralyze** (_not_ -se), **paralyzing**; _but_ **paralysis**

****paranoia, paranoiac, paranoid****

**paraphernalia** (plural)

**parenthesis, parentheses** (For guidelines on using see [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

**parimutuel** (_no_ hyphen, _not_ -tual) A form of betting

**pare** (to trim, to cut thinly); **pear** (fruit); **pair** (two)

**pairing** (put in twos); **paring** (cutting), **a paring knife**

**park-and-ride** (n. and adj.), as in: "They plan to build another park-and-ride near the train station," and "The transit system's first park-and-ride service started 20 years ago."

**Parker Bowles, Camilla** (became the Duchess of Cornwall in 2005 when she married then Prince Charles) Refer to her as **Camilla**, the **Queen Consort** or, by convention in conversational contexts, the Queen (e.g., King Charles and Queen Camilla). See [**royal titles**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-titles/#camilla "Royal titles") for details.

****Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism*

*Parks Canada****

**Parliament** (use a capital P only when referring to national legislative assemblies of English-speaking countries that use this term, such as Canada and Britain); **parliament** (as a generic term or in translations, such as Russia's parliament); **parliament** (provincial or regional assemblies) See also [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies)

**Parliament Buildings, Parliament Hill** (Ottawa), but **parliamentary** and **parliamentarian** (even in federal references) See also [MP](/home/m#MP) (member of Parliament)

****part time, a part-time job, a part-timer****

**Parti Québécois** (PQ), **Parti Québécois's** (possessive, but prefer PQ's or the party's), **Péquiste** (but _prefer_ "**PQ member,**" "party supporter," etc.) See also [Party versus party](/home/p/party)

[**Party** versus **party**](/home/p/party) (Conservative Party _or_ Conservative Party of Canada, as proper names and close abridgments; but Tory party, as a nickname; and political party, environmental party, etc., as generic usage)

****partier, party animal, party crasher, partygoer, party-pooper****

**Pashtun** (ethnic group in Afghanistan and Pakistan)

**Passchendaele, Battle of** (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) A First World War battle in Belgium in 1917 that left more than 15,000 Canadians dead and wounded. (See the [CBC Digital Archives feature](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Farchives.cbc.ca%2FIDC-1-71-979-5567-20%2Fthat_was_then%2Fconflict_war%2Fpasschendaele&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0LjrpLiHrG6L2If1V28BTZ) for more background)

**passed away, passed on** (generally _avoid_ these euphemisms in routine news reporting) See [death reporting guidelines](/home/d/death-general-guidelines)

**passerby, passersby**

**passive, passiveness, passivity** (inactive; not emotional; offering no resistance) Do not confuse with [pacifism](/home/p#pacifism), which refers to peace.

**passport** (n.) Commonly refers to a government-issued document for global travel. However, the definition of passport has expanded over the centuries to include more figurative meanings, from "a passport to heaven" and "a passport to fame" to a special events passport to enjoy, say, diverse food kiosks at a summer fair. Given such entrenched usage, the compounds **vaccine passport** and **vaccination passport** are instantly recognized and perfectly acceptable terms for an official **vaccine certificate** or **vaccine card** or other **proof of vaccination** document issued by public health authorities. Be aware that some governments, groups and individuals specifically avoid using the term "vaccine passport" for various reasons. While we should report this detail when it's directly relevant to a story, we do not have to adopt an external source's style ourselves. If one noun is more common in a given province or territory (e.g., "card" instead of "passport"), it can make editorial sense to prefer that language in local coverage because it's more familiar. Use your own judgment.

**Penetanguishene, Ont.** (The site of large provincial jail that can hold 1,200 inmates. It opened in 2001, and was privately run until the government of Ontario took control in November 2006. The official name is the Central North Correctional Centre. In headlines and second reference, the more common label "super-jail" is OK.)

**pension, Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**

**PepperBall** A registered trademark in the United States and the marketing name of a variety of products created and sold by American company United Tactical Systems. Perhaps the best known PepperBall products are projectiles containing irritants similar to pepper spray. As is the case with Taser, since **the word is proprietary**, it must be uppercase (“Police fired PepperBalls at the protesters”). **Be aware that other companies sell similar products**, so accuracy when reporting on PepperBalls outside of quotations requires certainty that the projectiles in question are actually PepperBall brand. **Consider other common generic alternatives**, such as pepper projectiles, or whether audiences may simply require more detailed explanation (“Officers shot ammunition similar to paintballs filled with pepper spray in an effort to disperse the crowds”). See also [trade names](/home/t/trade-names).

**Peshmerga** (name of Kurdish fighters backed by the Kurdistan regional government in northern Iraq) The Kurdish word, originally from Persian, literally means "ready to confront death." Our former style (lowercase and italics) was changed to regular type with a capital "P" in June 2014, based on evolving conventions in English news coverage. The term has become synonymous with Kurdistan's army: ****Peshmerga troops, Peshmerga forces****

**Petro-Canada** (hyphen)

**petrochemical** (no hyphen)

**PFAS** (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) OK in headlines and first reference, such as "a group of synthetic chemicals known as PFAS," but the abbreviation should be spelled out once high in stories. They've been dubbed **forever chemicals** because some of more than 4,700 substances don't degrade naturally, according to scientists, and, so, might be capable of remaining in the environment indefinitely. PFAS are found in a wide range of manufacturing processes and consumer products (e.g., clothing, cosmetics, food packaging, non-stick cookware, firefighting foam), and have been detected in humans and animals. It's accurate to describe them as potentially harmful chemicals, but experts say more research is needed to better understand health risks, including to organs, the nervous system and the immune system. Often plural as a noun or adjective (e.g., "PFAS were developed in the late 1930s"), but can be singular ("PFAS was found in the water"), particularly when a specific substance is meant. When spelling out PFAS, the clipped version **per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances** is a common and conversational alternative to **perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances**, especially in broadcast scripts. If using this shorthand, note the hyphen after per- before the conjunction. (See [hyphens](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens/#various "Hyphens") for related punctuation guidelines involving orphaned prefixes in compound sequences.)

**PGA** (Usually OK as an abbreviation, even in first reference) When spelled out, include the possessive apostrophe: **the Professional Golfers' Association**. Be aware that there are separate organizations around the globe, such as the **PGA of America** and the **PGA of Canada**, formerly known as the Canadian Professional Golfers’ Association (CPGA) until 2011. These groups are part of an international PGA alliance called **the Confederation of Professional Golf** (the CPG). See also [golf](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/g/golf/ "Golf") for various style preferences.

**Pheu Thai Party** (Thailand) For consistency, avoid other [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), including "Puea" and "Phuea"

**Prince Philip** (See [Royal titles](/home/r/royal-titles))

**Philippines, the** (country); **Philippine** (generic adj. for inanimate nouns, as in a Philippine company, Philippine law, the Philippine peso); [**Filipinos**](/home/f#Filipino) (the people) NOTE: It's not wrong to use "Philippine" to refer to citizens in various contexts, especially when the individuals are representing the country in an official capacity (e.g., the Philippine delegation, the Philippine president). Although this can be extended to broader usage (e.g., the Philippine people), Filipino/Filipina tend to be more common choices for individuals (e.g., Filipino doctors)

**philistine** (_only one l_) Keep lowercase to describe a person lacking or uninterested in culture. Use a capital P only for historical references to people opposing Israelites in ancient Palestine.

**Phnom Penh, Cambodia**

**phone booth, phone call** (two words), but **[payphone](/home/p#payphone)**  (fused)

**photobomb, photobomber, photobombing** (fused)

**photocopy** (n. and v.), **photocopier** (n.)

****photo-engraver, photo-engraving****

**photo gallery, photo galleries** (two words)

**Photoshop, Photoshopped, Photoshopping** (requires a capital P because it's a proprietary name, like Google) See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names) for details and other examples. When referring to general doctoring of digital images, generic alternatives include photo-editing software, altered image, touched-up photo and manipulated picture. If specific changes are known, narrower terms are clearest (e.g., cropped photo, air-brushed picture).

**phys ed** (n.), an acceptable but less common noun than the full term **physical education**, as in _phys ed and recess_; **phys-ed** (adj.), an acceptable and very common adjective, as in _phys-ed instructor_ and **phys-ed class** (See also [sex ed versus sex-ed](/home/s#sexed))

**piastre** (_not_ -er) A coin used in several countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria

****piccolo, piccolos****

**picket** (_not_ picketer), **picketed, picketing** (_"Hundreds of pickets marched outside the main gates." "The strikers stopped picketing at dusk."_) See also [strike versus lockout](/home/s#strike)

**Pickton, Robert William** (B.C. serial killer, charged in 2002 and convicted in 2007) Because of his notoriety, it's usually sufficient to refer to him as **Robert Pickton** in first reference. During coverage of his trial and various appeals, CBC News generally called him Robert William Pickton in first reference to match court documents. When context is required, it's OK to mention that Pickton also went by the name of Wille (e.g., to explain a specific quote or clip). But this background is rarely necessary. In web stories, the optional detail is easiest to add in brackets: **Robert William (Willie) Pickton**. For consistency, avoid the alternative spelling of Willy.

**pick up** (v.), **pickup** (n. or adj.) _"They used a pickup truck to pick up a new pickup for his electric guitar."_

****picnic, picnicker****

**piecemeal** (gradually, piece by piece; also unsystematic)

**pigeonhole** (no hyphen)

**the pill** (birth control pill)

**pileup** (n.), **pile up** (v.)

**pinch hit** (v. and n.), **pinch-hitter** (n.) See also [baseball terms](/home/b/baseball)

**Ping-Pong** (proprietary), as in a **Ping-Pong ball**, a **Ping-Pong match**, a **Ping-Pong table**. Generally prefer **table tennis** as a generic alternative (e.g.," Table tennis was added to the Summer Olympics in 1988"). Sometimes, however, Ping-Pong is a more conversational alternative, as in "Ping-Pong ball-size hail" rather than "table tennis ball-size hail" — along the lines of a "Band-Aid solution" or a game of Frisbee. See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names) for more details and examples, as well as [\-size instead of -sized](/home/s#size) for related guidelines.

**PIN** (fine in first reference; no need to define as "personal identification number") _Avoid_ redundancy "PIN number"

**pin up** (v.), **pin-up** (n.)

**pipeline** (But note the spelling of proper nouns, such as TransCanada PipeLines)

**pistol** (a handgun but not necessarily a revolver) See [weapons](/home/w/weapons)

**pixel** (n.) common and acceptable shorthand for "picture element"; does _not_ need to be spelled out or defined in stories as a tiny unit of uniform illumination; **pixelate** (v.) to divide an electronic image, screen, etc., into pixels.

**pizzazz**

**PKK** (**Kurdistan Workers' Party**) Abbreviation OK in headlines, but spell out in full at least once high in a story. Prefer this entrenched English translation over alternatives, such as "People's Worker Party," because it's clearer. The PKK can be described as an outlawed rebel group fighting for an independent Kurdish state in eastern Turkey. The militants began their armed insurgency decades ago (in 1984). The group is classified as a [terrorist group](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) by Turkey and a number of other countries, including Canada, the U.S. and Germany, as well as by NATO. Be aware that Turkey considers a Kurdish-led militia in neighbouring Syria known as the **People's Protection Units (YPG)** to be a terrorist group. The YPG can be accurately called the armed wing of the **Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD)**. The government in Ankara says the YPG in Syria is an offshoot of the PKK in Turkey. Avoid using too many obscure abbreviations, especially in broadcast scripts, which can quickly become incomprehensible. (See also **[Kurds](/home/k#Kurds)**)

[**place names**](/home/g/geography-cities) (two words, no hyphen)

**plagiarism, plagiarize**

**plainclothes police, a plainclothes officer** (_not_ –plainclothed) On duty but not in uniform, as in _"The plainclothes constable wore plain clothes."_

**planet, the planet Mars,** but **the Red Planet** (See also [space terms](/home/s/space-terms))

****plaster of paris*

*plateau, plateaus****

**platoon sergeant (Platoon Sgt.)** See also [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**play off** (v.), **playoff** (n.)

**PlayStation; PlayStation Portable** (**PSP** fine for PlayStation Portable as long as context is clear.)

**playwright** (person), but **playwriting** (process of writing, not wrighting, plays)

**plead, pleading, pleaded** (never pled) _"He pleaded not guilty,"_ and _"She pleaded with the kidnappers, begging them to free her children."_

**PLC** (A common abbreviation for "public limited company") No need to spell out in business stories. If you're adding this detail to a story, use all uppercase lettering and insert immediately after company's name, without periods, commas, etc., in first reference (e.g., **Vodafone Group PLC** and **Barclays PLC**, with **Vodafone** and **Barclays** sufficient in headlines and later references). When referring to such nouns in general news stories, PLC can be dropped (e.g., "BP PLC" becomes [BP](/home/b#BP)). This is based on a long-standing journalism convention. It serves our audience by communicating key information without adding peripheral jargon, and avoids awkward pileups such as "BP PLC CEO Tony Hayward." (See also [LLP](/home/l#LLP) and [LP](/home/l#LP))

**Plexiglas** (a capital "P" and only one "s") for a specific, brand name acrylic plastic; but **plexiglass** (lowercase, extra "s") for the generic product. See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names) for related guidelines.

**PLO** (Palestine Liberation Organization) See [Middle East Glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#palestinianauthority).

**plow** (_not_ plough) for all uses, from nouns (a **plow**) to verbs (**plow back, plow through, plow under**) and compound forms (**[plow wind](/home/w/weather-words#plowwind), snowplow**)

**plug-in** (n.) _"Adobe Photoshop offers a variety of plug-ins that work as digital darkroom filters,"_ and _"The garage has only one plug-in."_ (adj.) _"The plug-in device stopped working last week."_ **plug in** (v.) _"They told her to plug in the charger and wait an hour."_

****plummet, plummeted****

**[plurals](/home/p/plurals)** (an overview)

**plus, pluses** and minuses

**p.m., a.m.** (lowercase) 3 p.m. ET, 7:45 a.m. PT, etc. (See also [time](/home/t/time))

**podcast, podcasting** (lowercase; not proprietary) Although often associated with Apple's iPod, the word podcast is generic. The term describes various media files — long or short, free or purchased — that are available for playback on computers and mobile devices. Podcast is commonly used as a noun and verb.

**poet laureate** (lowercase), **poets laureate** (See [plural compounds](/home/c/courts-martial-and-other-plural-compounds))

**pogey** (slang for employment insurance)

****poinsettia****

**point-of-sale (POS) terminal** (Spell out in first reference, with POS in brackets) This is the equipment retailers use to debit bank accounts or to add charges to credit cards. Some terminals are wireless (e.g., they can be brought directly to a restaurant table). Others are attached to data lines next to cashiers. In either case, don't assume that customers have "swiped" their cards. Newer technology features "data chip" rather than "card-swiping" readers. The former involves inserting a card into the bottom of a POS, in the same way you insert a card into an [ABM](/home/a#ABM). In many stories, a generic term such as "debit card terminal" or "credit card reader" or even "[PIN](/home/p#PIN) pad" is often sufficient.

**Pokemon, Pokemon Go** (no accents, no quotation marks; initial caps only) The original Nintendo video game was created in the 1990s. A smartphone version, **Pokemon Go**, was released in 2016. For related guidelines, see [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words) and [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization).

**Polaroid** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for camera, sunglasses)

**the Pole; North Pole, South Pole; but the North and South poles; the poles, poles apart, polar** (See also [North, South, East, West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west))

[**Police** versus **police**](/home/p/police-forces) (See also [police ranks](/home/p/police-ranks))

**policymaker** (one word; hyphen dropped in 2022)

**polio** (short for poliomyelitis, but unnecessary to spell it out)

**Polish concentration camps** (_Inaccurate, misleading phrase. Avoid._) When referring to the Second World War facilities set up by Hitler's army in occupied Poland, use **Nazi concentration camps** or [**Nazi death camps**](/home/n#Nazi).

**Politburo** (See [Kremlin](/home/k/kremlin))

**polka-dot** (hyphen)

[polls](/home/p/polls) (general guidelines when reporting)

**Pollyanna** (a blindly or foolishly cheerful optimist) The word is based on a character in a novel by Eleanor Porter published in 1913.

**polygamist** (n.), **polygamous** (adj.), **polygamy** (n.) Having more than one wife or husband at the same time. Avoid the related but obscure term "polygyny," which simply refers to a specific type of polygamy (i.e., men who have more than one wife).

****pompom****

**pontiff** (for [Pope](/home/p/pope))

**Ponzi scheme** (capital P; named after 1920s fraudster Charles Ponzi) No need to define in news stories as long as the context makes the nature of the fraud clear. See [Ponzi versus pyramid](/home/p/ponzi-versus-pyramid-scheme)

**Pope Francis** (**Francis** OK in second reference and headlines) Do not add roman numerals. Pope Francis won't become Francis I until there's actually a Francis II. The preferred possessive is **Francis's** (e.g., "Pope Francis's inaugural homily," along the lines of "the witness's testimony" and "a business's profit"). **Pope** is capitalized on its own for the current pontiff only (e.g., "They met with the Pope for an hour"). Otherwise, use **pope** for general references (e.g., "Only cardinals under 80 can pick the next pope"). Pope is still capitalized in historical references to former popes as long as the word appears directly in front of a papal name (e.g., "Pope John Paul II" but "John Paul II became pope in 1978). See [**Pope versus pope**](/home/p/pope) for more details, including how to handle **pope emeritus** and related terms.

**poppyseed** (n. and adj.)

**Popsicle** (It's a [trademark](/home/t/trade-names) so the capital "P" remains frozen)

**Popular Party** (Spanish political party) For consistency, use this entrenched English translation of **_Partido Popular_**, rather than the alternative version "People's Party." The latter name is fine when attributed to others, as long as the context makes the meaning of the proper noun clear. It's OK to say "**also known as the People's Party**" in stories when both versions appear in clips or quotes.

**pore** (to study), **pored, poring** (e.g., over books); _Do not confuse with_ **pour** (as in rain, a jug of beer, etc) or **poor** (as in poverty)

**porta-potty** (hyphen) **porta-potties** (plural) Portable toilets are commonly called portable potties. The abridged form conventionally features a hyphen (porta-potty). Spell the less common compound **porta-john** (plural, **porta-johns**) the same way.

****porterhouse steak****

**portland cement** (lowercase) This cement's name was originally inspired by its colour, which is similar to limestone from the Isle of Portland.

**Portuguese** (the language spoken in Portugal as well as Brazil)

**POS** (see [point-of-sale terminal](/home/p#POS))

**possessive apostrophes** (See [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

**post (versus post-)** Many words are fused, including: **postdate** (v.), **postdated** cheque; **postelection; postgraduate; postmark; postmaster general, postmasters general** (see also [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix)); **postscript; postwar;** Others have hyphens, depending on convention: **post-game; post-mortem; post-production; post-season; post-secondary.**

**postal** (related to the post office or mail delivery); **go postal, went postal** (avoid) These informal terms refer to uncontrollable anger and violence, often set off by stress. They do not mean mere annoyance and have no place in hackneyed puns (e.g., we should not report on people "going postal" over crummy mail service). The colloquialisms were coined after a series of fatal shootings at U.S. post offices in the 1980s. They're considered offensive generalizations since they directly link postal workers with deranged behaviour — implying that these employees commit more acts of violence than others. The terms are acceptable when attributed (i.e., in clips and transcribed quotes). Otherwise, use a synonym (e.g., berserk, crazy, nuts) that matches the story's facts and tone.

**Post-it notes** (See [trade names](/home/t/trade-names))

**pot** Believed to be derived from a Spanish term related to cannabis leaves, "_potiguaya,_" pot is a common and generally acceptable synonym for cannabis or marijuana. However, **be aware that colloquialisms like "pot," or other similar terms such as “weed,” can affect the tone of stories**. So consider that when choosing which words are best suited to the story. See [marijuana](/home/m#marijuana).

**PotashCorp** (OK in web headlines and second reference) Generally use **Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan** in first reference whenever practical, since that's the official name and because it provides helpful geographical background. The fused abbreviation PotashCorp (two capital letters, no period) rather than Potash Corp., has become standard in recent years and is now preferred. (See also Corp. versus Corporation for related guidelines)

**potato, potatoes**

**potlatch** (an [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) ceremony)

**potshot**

**Poundmaker, Chief** (Cree leader, born in what is now central Saskatchewan in 1842) If referred to by his traditional name, **Pîhtokahanapiwiyin**, include his entrenched English name once in brackets in first reference for clarity (e.g., "widely known as Chief Poundmaker"). See also [Indigenous language spellings](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/indigenous/#spellings "Indigenous") and [transliterations](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transliterations/ "Transliterations")

**poutine** (french fries topped with cheese curds and gravy)

**PoW** (prisoner of war), **PoWs** (See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations))

**power line, power pole** (two words) See also [hydro versus power](/home/h/hydro-versus-power)

**power of attorney** (no hyphens)

**PowerPoint** (proprietary computer software) See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for related guidelines

**powwow** (_avoid using to describe brief meetings_) The word should be applied only to [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) cultural exchanges designated as powwows by organizers.

**PPP** (avoid this abbreviation except in directly transcribed quotes) See [public-private partnerships](/home/p#publicprivate) below


**[p-pg](/home/p#p) - [ph-pq](/home/p#ph) - [pr-py](/home/p#pr) - [bottom](/home/p#bottom)**

**pr-py**

**PR** (for public relations)

**practicable** (can be done, workable); **practical** (useful, sensible)

**practice** (n. or adj.), as in "late for practice" and a "practice rink"; **practise** (v.), as in "practise harder" and "practise with your eyes closed." Since the participle **practising** is formed from a verb it has an "s," as in "practising hockey." The modifier **practising** also has an "s" because it's a participle functioning as what some grammarians call a "verbal adjective" (e.g., a "practising Muslim," a "practising midwife").

**Prague** (not "Praha," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**pre (prefix)** prearrange, Precambrian shield, pre-Christian, precondition, predate, pre-election, pre-empt, pre-flight, pre-game, preheat, prejudge, premarital, preoccupy, prepaid, preschool, preschooler, pre-season, pre-show, presuppose, pre-symptomatic, presynaptic, pre-tax, preteen, prewar (See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens) for general guidelines)

**précis** (See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for general guidelines)

**prefer, preferred; preferable, preferably; preference** (_not_ -ance), **preferential**

**Premier** Kate Munro, **former premier** Clyde Wells, **deputy premier** Natasha Bezmozgis (an informal position), **the premier of Manitoba**, etc. In Canada, "premier" is now conventionally assigned to the leader of the governing party in provinces as well as territories: **Nunavut Premier** Paul Okalik, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. Avoid the expression "premiers and territorial leaders," which is redundant. (See also [titles](/home/t/titles) for general guidelines)

**premiers' conference** (_apostrophe_ added in 2020) See [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for details

**premier-designate, incoming premier** (but _never_ premier-elect) See [\-designate versus -elect](/home/p/pm-designate)

**premiere** (no accent required) first performance; but **premier** (first in rank or importance) _"The premium wine was the premier attraction at the play's premiere."_

**prerogative** (_not_ perog-)

**Presbyterian Church in Canada** (_not_ of Canada)

**President** versus **president** (See [titles](/home/t/titles)) Always include the country in first reference, such as U.S. President George W. Bush, Russian President Vladimir Putin, etc.

**Presidents Day** (_no_ possessive apostrophe) U.S. federal holiday; third Monday in February.

press conference (_use_ **news conference**)

**press gallery, press gallery dinner**, _but_ the **Parliamentary Press Gallery Association**

**pre-tax** (hyphen), **pre-tax income**

****pretence

[](/updates/2025/2025-06-03-pretendian)[pretendian](/updates/2025/2025-06-03-pretendian)**** Similar to [the word it is based on](/home/i/Indigenous#limituse), and for all the same reasons, the word pretendian should be treated with caution and consideration. Even with attribution, it should only be used when its inclusion is important to the public interest and the audience’s understanding of the story. Consider alternatives such as Indigenous identity fraud, questions about identity claims etc.

**pretrial** (pretrial evidence, pretrial motion, pretrial publicity, etc.)

****prevalence, prevalent****

**prevent, preventable, preventer** (_not_ -or), preventive (prefer over preventative, which is less conversational) See also [interpretive versus interpretative](/home/i#interpretive)

**price tag** (two words)

****pricey****

**PricewaterhouseCoopers** (Do _not_ add spaces or hyphens). The formal name of this accounting firm is "PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP." It was created in 1998 by the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand. **In headlines, Pricewaterhouse** on its own is fine. Use **PricewaterhouseCoopers in first reference** in the main body of a story. Either **Pricewaterhouse** or **PwC** is OK in second reference. The Canadian division is **Pricewaterhouse Coopers Canada**. Second reference is **Pricewaterhouse Canada** or **PwC Canada**. (See also LLP for general guidelines)

**Pride** (in the context of 2SLGBT+ events) **Pride Week**, a **Pride festival**, **Pride flag**, the **Pride parade**; retain lowercase only in generic expressions (e.g., "Embrace gay pride not gay shame," she said). See [**2SLGBTQ+**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#miscellaneous "2SLGBTQ+")

**priest** (lowercase) The word has a broad meaning. In some religions, it refers to an ordained minister with specific authority to perform certain rites and to administer various sacraments. In other religions, there's no formal hierarchy and the word priest is a common descriptive term (e.g., Hindu priest Pandit Roopnauth Sharma and Sikh priest Punjab Singh.) The title Rev. is used before full names of many priests, including Roman Catholics. See [**Rev.**](/home/r#Rev) for details.

**Prime Minister** Tom Haliburton, **the prime minister** spoke for an hour, **the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Deputy Prime Minister** Sam Slick, **the deputy prime minister** told reporters, **former prime minister** Brian Mulroney, etc. (See [titles](/home/t/titles) for more guidelines)

[**prime minister-designate**](/home/p/pm-designate) (_not_ prime minister-elect)

**prime time, prime-time program**

**prince and princess** Keep lowercase (she met the **prince**, Diana was not actually a **princess**) unless as a title before royalty (**Prince William**) or as part of a noun (the **Prince of Wales** spoke for 10 minutes; **Diana, the late Princess of Wales**). Prefer the person's name in second reference (**WIlliam** has championed the cause for decades; **Anne**'s official title is _Princess Royal_, although it's clearer and acceptable to call her **Princess Anne**) See [**royal titles**](/home/r/royal-titles) for detailed guidelines, including background on the informal use of "Princess Diana."

**Prince Edward Island, the Island (P.E.I.)** See [provinces, territories and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities)

**principal** (main, most important) as in "principal complaint," the "principal actor" and "principal payments" (a banking term for amounts applied to the original sum borrowed); **school principal** (lowercase, even before a name, as outlined in the [titles overview](/home/t/titles))

**principle** (a fundamental belief, rule of conduct, scientific law, etc., as in "the uncertainty principle" in physics); often appears in the plural, **principles** (a person of "high principles," our "guiding principles," etc.)

**prison** (keep lowercase except in proper name) See also [jail versus prison](/home/j/jail-versus-prison)

**prison guard, jail guard** (see [jail versus prison](/home/j/jail-versus-prison) for related guidelines) When writing about Canadian penitentiaries, be aware that the Correctional Service of Canada uses the term "correctional officer" instead of guard. Generally prefer either **correctional officer** or **prison officer** when referring to these employees in first reference, along the lines of parole officer. The term **guard** remains common and acceptable, however, including in second reference to correctional officers.

**prognosis** (a forecast) See [diagnosis versus prognosis](/home/d/diagnosis-versus-prognosis)

**program** (_not_ -mme), **programmer, programming;** But use a capital P when the generic word "program" is part of a proper noun (e.g., **Canada Small Business Financing Program**, the [**Food Mail Program**](/home/f#FoodMailProgram), the [**National Energy Program**](/home/n#NEP)). This sometimes means differentiating between a formal name (the **Canada Student Loans Program**) and a common description (the federal **student loan program**).

**Progressive Conservative (PC)** In national political stories, always include the word "Progressive" when distinguishing between the new federal Conservative Party and the old Progressive Conservatives. Be aware that the name PC continues to be used in a number of provincial parties. (See [Party versus party](/home/p/party) for details)

**public servants** (public sector employees) The term **civil servants**, coined in Britain in the 1790s, has been widely used in Canada since Confederation and remains OK as a synonym. "Civil" in this context means "civilian." The Canadian Oxford defines civil servants as the "permanent professional branches of government administration, excluding military and judicial branches and elected politicians." **Be aware that some workers want to be called public servants**. While the entrenched compound civil servant is not inherently pejorative, respect known preferences in stories about specific individuals whenever practical.

**Public Service Alliance of Canada** (one of the largest unions in the country) **PSAC** is OK in headlines and second reference, but the full name should be spelled out once high in stories. The public sector union was formed in 1966 after the **Civil Service Federation of Canada** and the **Civil Service Association of Canada** merged.

In Pakistan, Punjab is the country's most populous province.** AVOID USING A DEFINITE ARTICLE before the proper noun Punjab on its own (i.e., **do NOT say or write "the Punjab"**). See ["the" in geographical names](/home/t/the-versus-the#geographical) for related guidelines (e.g., it's The Hague, with a capitalized "The," but the West Indies, with a lowercase "the," and always Ukraine instead of "the Ukraine").

### particles de du van von

**Particles (de, du, von, van, etc.) in names**

Most particles found in proper names in Europe originally functioned as what we would think of as prepositions (of, at) — linking someone to a geographical place (a _sobriquet de terre_). Centuries ago, the rules were relatively simple. In French names, for instance, when the surname was used alone the particle was virtually always dropped: _Alexis de Tocqueville_ became **Tocqueville**, not de Tocqueville. But then the small words became a big deal if associated with rank or nobility (a _particule nobiliaire_), and they started hanging around certain surnames like aristocrats around court: **Marquis de Sade** became **de Sade**, not just Sade. At this point, only a masochist would try offering tips. But here goes.

**There's no convenient, universal rule about when to retain particles in surnames in second reference.** (Vincent van Gogh becomes **van Gogh** but Ludwig van Beethoven becomes just **Beethoven**.) There is, however, an important guideline: **When deciding whether to drop or retain particles in news stories, find out if there's either an established usage** (e.g., a historical figure) **or an expressed personal preference.** Since some patterns have been linked to different nationalities, additional broad direction appears below:

**1\. French names
2\. Spanish names
3\. Dutch names
4\. Other European names
5\. Fused particles
6\. Vietnamese names
7\. Arabic names**

**1\. In French names, particles are generally dropped after first reference** (**Alfred de Musset** becomes **Musset** and **Dominique de Villepin** becomes **Villepin**). **But there are exceptions, usually based on a person's specific preference or historical usage** (Charles de Gaulle becomes **de Gaulle**). Personal preferences vary in different parts of the world. **Many but not all people with French names who are citizens of English-speaking countries tend to retain the particle** (Thomas De Quincey becomes **De Quincey**). This is **also true in Canada** (retired general John de Chastelain becomes **de Chastelain**). Note: **When two particles appear, especially in French names, the trend is to keep only the second one** (Jean de La Fontaine becomes **La Fontaine**), **but there are exceptions** (Walter de la Mare becomes **de la Mare**). If a lowercase particle is retained, it's always capitalized at the start of a sentence or headline: De Gaulle, De la Mare.

**2\. Particles in Spanish names follow a similar pattern:** Manuel de Falla becomes Falla and Miguel de Cervantes becomes Cervantes. If the particle is in the middle of what's considered the surname, however, it's kept: Félix Lope de Vega becomes Lope de Vega.

**3\. In Dutch names, the particles are generally retained** (Vincent van Gogh becomes van Gogh, Gerard ter Borch becomes ter Borch and Janwillem Lincoln van de Wetering becomes van de Wetering). Again, if a lowercase particle is retained, it's always capitalized at the start of a sentence or headline. Van Gogh, Ter Borch, Van de Wetering.

**4\. In other European languages such as German, Austrian, Italian and Portuguese, the particles are often but not always dropped**, depending on a person's specific preference or historical usage (Ludwig van Beethoven becomes Beethoven, but Josef von Sternberg is conventionally written as von Sternberg and members of Georg von Trapp's family in _The Sound of Music_ are known as the von Trapps). In the case of some famous figures, the first name is commonly used in second reference (Leonardo da Vinci becomes Leonardo, except in popular phrases such as _The Da Vinci Code_). If a lowercase particle is retained, it's always capitalized at the start of a sentence or headline: Von Sternbeg, Von Trapps.

**5\. A particle actually fused to a last name is considered part of a single unit and is always retained** in second reference (**D'Armato, duBois, d'Hervilly, Debussy, Demers**). If lowercase, it's always capitalized at the start of a sentence or headline: DuBois, D'Hervilly.

**6\. In Vietnamese names, Van is normally uppercase in the full name and frequently dropped in second reference** (Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai becomes Khai, and Nguyen Van Thanh becomes Thanh). See also [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) for related guidelines.

**7\. Particles in Arabic names** are somewhat different. Since they're frequently tied to another person (e.g., bin = "son of") rather than to a specific geographic location, they're **often retained** (**Osama bin Laden** becomes **bin Laden** in second reference). See [Arabic names](/home/a/arabic-names) for related guidelines.

### Party

**Party versus party**

**Keep the generic word "party" lowercase unless (a) it’s part of an official name** or **(b) a common abridgment** that retains most of the official name:


> He helped found the country's first socialist **party**.
>
> Before becoming a Liberal premier, he led the old federal Tory **party** for three years.
>
> She joined the New Democratic **Party** in 2005.
>
> He supported John Turner at the Liberal **Party**'s leadership convention.


NOTE: Using "Party" in common abridgments was adopted by CBCNews.ca in September 2009. We decided that CP's more formal approach (Liberal party but Liberal Party of Canada) is not as easy for readers to scan, harder for journalists to remember and sometimes leads to inconsistent treatment of parties in the same story (e.g., the Liberal _party_ policy but the New Democratic _Party_ policy).

The word "party" should be **lowercase in plural** constructions, even when proper nouns are used:


> The Conservative and Liberal **parties** are holding fundraising dinners the same night.


Here are **some common uses of "Party" in news stories**, including acceptable short forms of official names:

**Conservative Party** (_common name of federal party founded in 2003_)
Conservative Party of Canada (_formal name of federal party_)
**Democratic Party
Green Party** (_common name of federal party founded in 1983_)
Green Party of Canada (_formal name of federal party_)
**Labor Party** (_Australia_) but **Labour Party** (_Britain_) See [defence, labour, centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for relevant guidelines
**Liberal Party** (_common name of federal party_)
Liberal Party of Canada (_formal name_)
**New Democratic Party** (**NDP**, _but never "NDP Party"_)
Progressive Conservative Party (_common name of old PC Party_)
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (_formal name of old PC Party_)
**Republican Party**
Saskatchewan Party
[**United Conservative Party**](/home/u#UCP) (in Alberta)

**When reporting on political parties in other countries, make certain the location is clear.** Sometimes the proper noun includes this information (e.g., the **Sri Lankan Freedom Party**). In other cases, adjectives or other descriptive detail should be added (e.g., **Britain's Labour Party**) unless the story's context already makes the party's identity clear (e.g., the Democratic Party in an article about politics in Washington or the **Baath Party** in a story about Iraq).


**Federal Conservative Party**

In the fall of 2003, the Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the new federal **Conservative Party of Canada**, which we usually call the **Conservative Party** for short. Its members are _Conservatives_. In second reference, we can use the term Tory (Tories) sparingly for variety, but the longer word _Conservatives_ should appear more often. _Tory and Tories are fine in headlines_. When referring to the **old Progressive Conservative Party**, be sure to include the word "Progressive." It can also be called the **old PC Party** or the old Tory party. **This generally includes historical references to former politicians, especially when they, themselves, make a point of distinguishing between specific party affiliations** (e.g., prefer Joe Clark was a Progressive Conservative MP over a "Conservative MP").


**Provincial PC parties**

Although the letters PC are no longer in the federal Conservative Party's name, **the words "Progressive Conservative" remain in the names of numerous provincial parties across the country.** This detail can be reported in spelled-out long form (e.g., Ontario Progressive Conservatives, the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia) or in short form (e.g., PCs in Ontario and Nova Scotia's PCs).


**Other usage notes**
**Canadian Alliance** (The word party is already implied by the noun Alliance. If it's added, keep it lowercase: the **old Canadian Alliance party**.) The official name of that federal party was the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance, although this was almost always shortened to Canadian Alliance. See [Conservative Party](/home/p/party#ConservativeParty) above

**Bloc Québécois** (Party is already implied; no need to add). Prefer **the Bloc** in second reference, although BQ is fine in headlines. The possessive is spelled Bloc Québécois’s (but prefer **the Bloc’s**). The extra "s" is not spoken on air.
**Parti Québécois** ("Parti" is "Party" in French; do not add "Party" again, or it becomes the Quebec Party Party). **PQ** is fine in second reference or headlines. The possessive is spelled Parti Québécois’s (but prefer **PQ’s** instead). The extra "s" is not spoken on air. Prefer **PQ membe**r to Péquiste.

Use English capitalization for the names of French political parties (e.g., **Action Démocratique du Québec** not _Action démocratique du Québec_, **Coalition Avenir Québec** not _Coalition avenir Québec_, and **Québec Solidaire** not _Québec solidaire_.) This is an extension of a well-established convention. In French, for example, the PQ’s official name should technically be half lowercase (_Parti québécois_), according to _Le guide du rédacteur_, a style manual published by the federal government’s official translation bureau. But Parti Québécois is much more common. See [French words and accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#capitalization) for more detailed guidelines, as well as [separatist and sovereigntist](/home/s/separatist-sovereigntist) for a related editorial note.

Use terms such as **left-wing** and **right-wing** with care when describing political parties or people. See [left-wing versus right-wing](/home/l/left-wing-versus-right-wing) for more details.

### pedal versus peddle

**Pedal versus peddle**

The verb pedal means moving a pedal (e.g., riding a bicyle). The verb peddle means to sell. But a seller is called a pedlar, which leaves some spellers’ brains spinning.


**cycling**
**pedal, pedaller, pedalling**


**selling**
**peddle, pedlar, peddling**

**Common slips**
1\. A pedlar (seller) is wrongly referred to as a pedaller (cyclist).

2\. The words pedaller and pedalling are given only one “l” each (the American spellings).

3\. When describing a seller, a variant spelling (“peddler”) is used instead of the traditional one (“pedlar”).


**softpedal**
The word “softpedal,” by the way, can be applied to selling (to describe a person who doesn’t push a product or service too hard).

But the spelling shouldn’t be changed. The term comes from the world of pianos (referring to the pedal that makes the sound softer).

### pedophile

**Pedophile**

Pedophilia is not a crime. It's a psychiatric condition. **Never imply that people have been convicted of pedophilia** (e.g., "Convicted pedophile John Smith ..."). **Instead, specify the crime they've pleaded guilty to or have been found guilty of** (e.g., sexual assault, distributing child pornography, etc.).

**The terms "pedophilia" and "pedophile" can be used to describe people who are sexually attracted to YOUNG children as long as this sexual attraction is not in doubt.** There's no universally accepted age range, but **the word commonly implies prepubescent children** (normally under 12).

**When stories involve older children,** the label pedophilia in considered inaccurate. While other jargon exists (e.g., "pederasty" traditionally refers to men having sexual relations with boys between roughly 12 and 17), it's too obscure for routine news reporting. So instead of using confusing or imprecise labels, **prefer meaningful, conversational descriptions** (e.g., "sex with underage boys").

**While the word pedophile requires editorial judgment, it doesn't require a psychiatric assessment or legal finding** before we adopt it (unlike terms such as "mentally fit" or "insane"). We should have no qualms about using pedophile when it's applicable.


> EXAMPLE: A Quebec man, Richard Reber, sexually assaulted a four-year-old girl and videotaped the crime. After his guilty plea, there was nothing wrong with describing him as a pedophile, or with using this word high in our court coverage, including in the headline: "Quebec pedophile sentenced to 10 years." To ensure that our audience fully understood the story, we also needed to specify what he had actually confessed to (i.e., sexual assault and distribution of child pornography). But referring to him as a "convicted pedophile" would have been inaccurate, since pedophilia is not a crime.


 For the [preferred way to say pedophile](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D35460&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3qpsLJ8AG028yQEmseL2o3), see the CBC Pronunciation Database.

### per

**Per versus a/an**

**Although English is full of Latin** (caveat, [percentage](/home/p/per-cent-versus-percentage)), **using too much Latin on its own can give the impression of being full of oneself**. For example, saying "caveat emptor" instead of "buyer beware" serves little purpose in a news story. If you don't explain it, you risk confusing members of our audience unfamiliar with the expression. And if you do explain it, you make a story longer than it needed to be.

**The word "per" has become so common it's worth special mention.** In the past, many editors discouraged its use as a preposition ("per person") or as an adverb or adjective outside of bona fide Latin compounds ("per annum," "per capita"). However, **using "per" instead of an indefinite article ("a" or "an") is now largely stylistic**:


> $25 an hour / $25 per hour
> $100 a person / $100 per person
> $75,000 a year / $75,000 per year


This **more relaxed approach to incorporating the Latin "per"** into English syntax **is primarily based on a growing number of increasingly common expressions**, such as:


> kilometres per hour 
> megabytes per second
> miles per gallon
> parts per million
> pixels per inch
> as per usual

### per cent versus percentage

**Per cent versus percentage**

If there's any math in your stories, be sure the calculations are correct. For starters, double-check additions and subtractions. If a legislature has 103 seats, for instance, then the number of winners on election night should add up correctly.

When dealing with large numbers, you don't have to balance to the penny. In a story about proposed government spending, for example, figures can be rounded (e.g., about $115 million instead of $113,985,671). But make certain that the breakdown makes sense. Too much rounding can leave readers puzzled if the figures listed in one paragraph don't add up to the total given in another part of the story.

**One of the most common traps journalists fall into is using the wrong language when comparing figures.** We claim that something has risen or dropped by, say, "five per cent," when in fact the change may be a lot larger. What we generally mean is that something has moved up or down "five percentage points."


**Per cent**
The term "percentage point" can sound too technical in some stories. It may also hide the true extent of a shift. But **if we want to express a "percentage point" change as a specific "per cent" of the original amount, _we can't simply switch words_. We need to perform a calculation first.**

Example 1: A political party's popularity goes from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, according to the latest public opinion poll. This is a five percentage point decrease, but a 25 per cent plunge. (15 – 20 = -5, and -5 represents a drop of one-fourth, or - 25 per cent, of the original 20, because 5 x 4 = 20.)

Example 2: A political leader's popularity goes from 12 per cent to 16 per cent, according to the latest public opinion poll. This is a four percentage point increase, but a 33 per cent leap (16 – 12 = 4, and four represents a jump of one-third, of 33.3 per cent, of the original 12, because 4 x 3 = 12.)


**Percentage point**
**"Percentage points" are a convenient way of looking at a change in a figure already expressed as a fraction of 100 (a percentage)**, such as the inflation rate, unemployment rate, [GDP](/home/g/gdp-versus-gnp) or central  [bank rate](/home/b/bank-rate).

The smaller the original number, the more volatile the same change will be when expressed as a "per cent" of it.

Example1: If short-term interest rates go from five to 7.5 over one year, they've risen 2.5 percentage points but have actually jumped 50 per cent. (2.5 is half of the original 5.0).

Example 2: If short-term interest rates go from 7.5 to five per cent over one year, they've dropped 2.5 percentage points but have actually fallen 33.3 per cent (2.5 is one-third of the original 7.5).

**To compare percentages, use simple subtraction:**

7.5 – 5.0 = 2.5 percentage points

**To calculate a "per cent" change, use subtraction, division and multiplication:**

( New Number – Original Number ) ÷ Original Number X 100 = %
( 7.5 – 5.0 ) ÷ 5.0 x 100 = 50 % increase

### Persian Gulf

**Persian Gulf**

For consistency, call the arm of the Arabian Sea that borders the coast of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia (and a few other countries) "**the Persian Gulf.**" In second reference, "**the Gulf**" is fine.

**Do _not_ refer to this body of water as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia**, which can confuse Canadians unfamiliar with the region. (It's a bit like suddenly calling the Gulf of Mexico the Florida Gulf or the Gulf of Texas).

The official name of the Persian Gulf is disputed in the region. Arab countries prefer Arabian Gulf. Iran insists on Persian Gulf. CBCNews.ca isn't interested in taking sides but does want to be accurate and consistent.

Persian Gulf is the long-established term in western Europe, a translation of various Latin terms (including Sinus Persicus and Mare Persicum) that date back to the days when Iran was known as Persia.

The 2003 Globe and Mail Style Book also recommends calling it the Persian Gulf. The 2009 Associated Press manual agrees: "Use Arabian Gulf only in direct quotations," AP advises, "And explain in the text that the body of water is more commonly known as the Persian Gulf."

To sum up: CBCNews.ca prefers the term Persian Gulf (the Gulf in second reference).

**Continue to refer to the Arabian Sea by its name, of course.** (This is the large body of water along the coast of Oman, Pakistan and India.) The Arabian Sea is part of the Indian Ocean, and stretches through the Gulf of Oman, past the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf.

See also [Persian Gulf War](/home/p/persian-gulf-war)

### Persian Gulf War

**Persian Gulf War**

Do _not_ use terms like the First Persian Gulf War or Gulf War I.

Instead, call the first military clash between Saddam Hussein and U.S.-led coalition forces **the 1991 Persian Gulf War.**

The 1991 war was by no means the “first” war in the Persian Gulf.

See also [Persian Gulf](/home/p/persian-gulf) versus Gulf of Arabia.

### phone numbers

**Phone numbers**

**Prefer a standard publishing style for phone numbers.** This means **hyphens between** **clusters,** including area codes (e.g., 604- and 403-) **but NOT between individual numbers that make up clusters** (e.g., 416- rather than 4-1-6), including within traditional groupings of three or four characters after area codes:

> 416-205-3311
>
> 514-597-6000
>
> 867-920-5400

**
Maintain this style for abridged phone numbers used as nouns and adjectives**, including the term 911:

> She dialed **0** by mistake.
>
> The **911** dispatcher phoned him back.
>
> They live in what's known as the **905** region near Toronto.
>
> He disputed the $2 charge for using **411**.


Note: A solidus (/) rather than a hyphen is generally used for dates, such as 9/11 for [Sept. 11, 2001](/home/s#Sept11).

**Be aware that punctuation is highly subjective.** For instance, SOS (our style) will sometimes appear elsewhere as S.O.S., S-O-S, etc. The same applies to numbers, such as 911, which some organizations write as 9-1-1. **There's no single correct approach. For consistency, however, we prefer to use the standard publishing conventions outlined above.** Text is easier for our audience to scan when it's uncluttered by unnecessary hyphens, periods, etc. Also, it's faster and easier for us to rewrite wire copy under deadline pressure because our style matches the approach taken by CP, AP and most other major news organizations in North America.

### Plants

**Plants**

**Generally capitalize only the proper noun components of plant names** (e.g., maple trees but Italian parsley), keeping generic words lowercase:


> **Alberta red winter
> basil
> dandelion
> dogwood
> Douglas fir
> Fraser fir
> Italian parsley
> Japanese primrose
> Kentucky blue grass
> maple tree
> McIntosh apples
> Meyer lemons**
> **poinsettia** (entrenched lowercase, even though originally based on a man's name: Joel Roberts Poinsett)
> **Scotch pine
> Selkirk wheat
> white Dutch clove**r


**Common exceptions are specific varieties of fruits, vegetables and other plants with colloquial names that are treated as proper noun equivalents** (Royal Gala apples, Afghan Kush marijuana) based on convention:


> **Cabernet Sauvignon** grapes (see wines and spirits)
> **Delicious** (apples)
> **Golden Russet** (pears)
> **Granny Smith** (apples)
> **Purple Haze** (cannabis)
> **Pure Sativa** (cannabis)
> **Yukon Gold** (potatoes)

### Plurals

**Plurals**

**In most cases, you add an "s"** (_writer_ becomes _writers_) **or "es"** (_lens_ becomes _lenses_).

**But there are irregular forms to watch for,** and they're not easily explained (_ox_ becomes _oxen_, but _box_ does not turn into _boxen_):

1.  **Sometimes** you use **a different word** (_child_ becomes _children_) 2.  **Sometimes** you stick with **the same word** (one _aircraft_, five _aircraft_; _one deer, five deer; one moose, four moose_) 3.  **Sometimes you have the option to tack on an s** (_one beer, five beer_ or _five beers_) and it comes down to internal style (i.e., CBC News prefers "beers" for the plural, as in "He had a few beers" and "Some beers have a much higher malt content").
4.  **Sometimes you change a vowel or other letter**, based on old Greek forms (_crisis_ become _crises_, _basis_ becomes _bases_, _thesis_ becomes _theses_, etc.).
5.  **Sometimes old Latin rules apply** (_medium, media_) while **in other cases they're ignored** (_referendums, aquariums, stadiums, insurance premiums,_ etc.).
6.  **Sometimes old Latin rules** (_larva, larvae_) **are applied to the same word differently**, depending on context (_antennae_ for insects, but _antennas_ for broadcasting).
7.  **Sometimes an "f" turns into a "v"** (_calves, knives, shelves_ and _scarves_) **but not always** (_handkerchiefs, hoofs, roofs_ and _wharfs_). In several cases, more than one option exists, which means the CBC needs a preference (_dwarfs_, not _dwarves_).
8.  **Sometimes it's "oes"** (_buffaloes, dominoes, echoes, embargoes, frescoes, heroes, innuendoes, mosquitoes, potatoes, salvoes, tomatoes, tornadoes, volcanoes_) and **sometimes it's "os"** (_avocados, concertos, dynamos, Eskimos, Filipinos, ghettos, lassos, pianos, silos, solos, sopranos, zeros,_ etc.) In several cases, more than one option exists, which means the CBC needs a preference (_banjos_, not _banjoes_).
9.  **Sometimes you change "y" to "ies"** (_cherry, cherries_ and _mommy, mommies_) even in the case of certain names (_Johnny, Johnnies_ and _Rocky Mountains, Rockies_), **but often you use "ys" with such proper nouns** (many _Little Italys_, unification of the _two Germanys_, she knew _three Kennedys_, the room was full of _Marys_, they all had _BlackBerrys_) based largely on convention. 

**If you're not sure about a plural form, check this site's alphabetical directory. If it's not there, consult the Canadian Oxford Dictionary dictionary.**

### PM designate

**\-designate versus -elect**

**When someone is named to a position but hasn't actually begun working in an official capacity yet, the qualifier "designate" is often used.** In these cases, add only one hyphen and keep the label lowercase, even before a full name.

> UN secretary general-designate Ban Ki-moon


Other less formal options exist, of course, including generic descriptions such as "next" or "incoming."

**Avoid using the term "elect" in a temporary title unless it actually applies** (e.g., president-elect but prime minister-designate). The difference is outlined below.



[president-elect, senator-elect, etc.](/home/p/pm-designate#president) (U.S.)

**prime minister-designate**
**_Never_ use the term prime minister-elect** in stories about Ottawa. It is wrong.

In our parliamentary system, **Canadians do not pick prime ministers in general elections.** They vote for candidates who represent parties. **Parties form governments** (minority or majority). **Political parties choose their own leaders.
**
If the person who was PM in the previous Parliament wins the election and forms the next government, we simply continue to call the person prime minister. The same convention applies to premiers. For details, see: [titles during elections](/home/e/election-titles).

**When someone new is waiting to enter 24 Sussex Drive** (after an election, for instance, or following a leadership convention), **we refer to this person as the "next prime minister"** or the **"incoming prime minister"** (lowercase).

She or he can also be called **"prime minister-designate"** (lowercase, with one hyphen, even before the name) before they're officially sworn in. This is both CBC News and CP style:

> Prime Minister John Thompson sat down with prime minister-designate Mackenzie Bowell to talk about the transition of power.


**The title "prime minister-designate" is the official term used by the Prime Minister's Office** (e.g., in news releases after a leadership convention or a general election). Avoid uppercase letters or extra hyphens, however, which are sometimes tossed in at random in news releases.

So in November 2003, when the Liberals picked a new leader (Paul Martin) to replace retiring MP Jean Chrétien, Martin became the prime minister-designate until he was officially sworn in one month later. And in January 2006, when Stephen Harper's Conservatives defeated Martin's Liberals, Harper became prime minister-designate until he officially took office in early February.

In this context, "designated" means "appointed to a position but not yet occupying it," as defined in the Canadian Oxford. In the same way that a cabinet minister is named to a job, Canada's "first" or "prime" minister is also technically selected by the Crown based on that MP's position as leader of a federal political party chosen to form the government. **Based on convention, we can begin using the term "prime minister-designate" immediately, even though it generally takes time for the King's representative to sign the necessary papers.**

When a minority government falls, Canadians normally face a general election. But under certain circumstances it's possible for the Governor General to pick a different federal party leader if it's felt that this person could secure and maintain the confidence of the House of Commons (e.g., through a coalition with another party, depending on the overall seat distribution). This is a clear example of how MPs are "named" or "designated" rather than "elected" as prime minister.

Generally avoid the label **prime-minister-in-waiting** (lowercase with three hyphens). The term _in-waiting_ originally meant royal _servant_ (e.g., a lady-in-waiting), although it's now sometimes applied to political figures preparing to assume power. CBC News prefers **prime minister-designate**.

**The title "prime minister" is capitalized only when it's followed by the name of the current head of government. This is true regardless of the country** (Canada, Britain, etc.)

> Prime Minister Namof Aperson ...
>
> The prime minister met with her cabinet ...
>
> Former prime minister John Turner ...


**premier-designate**
The above guidelines also apply to premiers before they're officially sworn in. We use words such as **"incoming premier"** and **"next premier"** and **"premier-designate"** (but _never_ "premier-elect").

**Based on convention, we can begin using the term "premier-designate" immediately, even though it generally takes time for the King's representative to sign the necessary papers.**


**governor general-designate**
This is the official term used for the individual chosen to become the monarch's next representative in Canada. Although government officials tend to use uppercase letters and no punctuation, CBC News (and CP) style is **governor general-designate** (lowercase with one hyphen).

Only the current Governor General gets capital letters, and there is no hyphen. For more details, see [governor general versus Governor General](/home/g/governor-general)


**president-elect, senator-elect, etc. (U.S)**
**For stories about political change in the United States, which has a different electoral system, we use the term "president-elect"** (lowercase with a hyphen).

> U.S. president-elect Norm Reynolds wrote to CBC.ca requesting a photograph of Mr. Dressup.

The same approach is taken with other American political figures before they're officially sworn in (e.g., a senator-elect or a representative-elect heading to [Congress](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/congress/ "Congress")).

**mayor-elect, MP-elect, MPP-elect**
**We also use the word _elect_ to describe some incoming political office holders in Canada, such as a riding's new MP or MLA, a city's new mayor or a town's new councillor**, because voters actually pick these people directly:

> The strikers asked for a meeting with mayor-elect Cam Conway.


**But this term does NOT apply to incumbents.** During election campaigns, Parliament still has MPs, provincial legislatures still have MPPs, MLAs (or whatever other term applies in a given region), municipalities still have mayors. These people continue to be paid. If they win on election night, therefore, they're simply "re-elected." It's neither necessary nor accurate to refer to them as an "MP-elect" or an "MPP-elect" or a "mayor-elect."

**Even for winning candidates who defeated incumbents, we normally drop the qualifier "elect" within days of the vote** (e.g., the labels MP-elect or MPP-elect are replaced by "incoming" or "newly elected" MP or MPP).

There is normally a two-step process to become a member of Parliament or a member of a provincial/territorial legislative body in Canada. First, the chief electoral officer issues an official list of winning names tied to the returning of writs from all constituencies. The process can take weeks. Second, declared winners who are not part of the government's cabinet then schedule private appointments to take relevant oaths of office. But it's not practical to insist on using terms such as "MP-elect" or "MPP-elect" until we've confirmed that all of the oaths have been taken. Instead, **CBC News follows the convention of calling virtually all of the winners MPs, MPPs, etc., within about a week of the general election** — normally around the time of the new cabinet's swearing-in ceremony. **The only exceptions are close races that have triggered official recounts.**

See also [**titles during elections**](/home/e/election-titles) and our main [election primer](/home/e/election-primer) for related guidelines, as well as the general [titles overview](/home/t/titles) for detailed typographical style

### Police forces

**Police versus police**

**Keep the generic word "police" lowercase, except in formal names:**

Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Ontario Provincial Police (_actual name_)
Quebec provincial police (See [Sûreté du Québec](/home/s#SQ) for related guidelines on use of French noun)
[Newfoundland and Labrador](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador) provincial police
_but_ the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (proper noun)
Frederitcon Police Force
Halifax Regional Police
Vancouver Police Department
Calgary Police Service
but Calgary police commission
Toronto Police Service
Toronto police
police station
police car
police officer (_better than policeman or policewoman_)


**Generic use of 'force'
**It's **generally OK to use the lowercase noun "force" as a synonym for service, department, etc., in generic references** (e.g., Vancouver's police force to mean the Vancouver Police Department). **Sometimes context and a given story's tone can influence word choice.** For instance, "force" directly conveys the sense of law enforcement (e.g., when criminal charges are laid), while "service" can telegraph something broader (e.g., crowd control at a parade).


**RCMP but not CPD
****With the exception of well-known initialisms such as the RCMP, we generally avoid abbreviating the names of police forces in national stories.** So instead of writing CPD for the Chicago Police Department in second reference, use conversational alternatives (e.g., Chicago police, the city's police force). While **LAPD** and **NYPD** are common enough to use in stories in headlines and second reference, they still require spelling out once in full (i.e., as the Los Angeles Police Department and the City of New York Police Department).  Another example is **OPP**, which needs to be defined at least once as the Ontario Provincial Police, since not everyone in our audience will be familiar with the abbreviation.


**police officer**
**The term "police officer" is acceptable for any rank on a given force.** Police in Canada do not follow the military's practice of clearly branding its members as commissioned or non-commissioned officers.


**military police**
**Keep "military police" lowercase unless the words are being used as part of the full, formal name of a unit:**

They attacked a military police convoy.
Military police have launched a search for a missing cadet.
He's a member of the 18th U.S. Military Police Brigade.
The 720th U.S. Military Police Battalion heads to Iraq next month.

For a discussion of "police chief" versus "police Chief," etc. see [police ranks](/home/p/police-ranks)
See also [RCMP are versus RCMP is](/home/r/rcmp-are-versus-rcmp-is)
See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) (an overview)

### Police ranks

**Police ranks**

**TV TEXT REMINDER:** Be aware that television graphics, banners, supers, etc., have some unique typographical conventions. The biggest difference is the use of more initial capital letters in titles, job descriptions, etc. (e.g., "Former Prime Minister" instead of former prime minister, and "High School Principal" instead of high school principal). See the [**TV Text overview**](/home/t/tv_text) for details.

**Use abbreviations only before names. The short forms are always capitalized:**

Supt. Janice Bird
Det. John Sparrow

**Write out ranks used without names:**

The superintendent spoke to the family.
The detective said nothing.

Some terms, such as chief and commissioner, are not abbreviated.

**Keep descriptive words like “police” and “fire” in lowercase** unless they’re part of a force’s name:

_They demanded to see police Chief Fred Ming.
Reporters talked to fire Chief Ruth Buzz.
She's a member of the Toronto Police Service.
The Ontario Provincial Police budget._

**Don't insert words like “police” or “fire” in the middle of ranks.** Write _Deputy Chief Rick McKee_ instead of Deputy police Chief Rick McKee (because the rank is _Deputy Chief_).

For a more detailed discussion of “Police versus police,” see [police forces](/home/p/police-forces).

**Here is a list of common ranks and our abbreviations.** Each force has its own system, so not all titles will be used in each community:


 **rank on its own**

 **rank before a name (Staff Sgt. Dudley Do-Right)**

 chief

 Chief

 commissioner

 Commissioner (used by the RCMP)

 deputy chief

 Deputy Chief

 deputy commissioner

 Deputy Commissioner (used by the RCMP)

 assistant commissioner 

 Assistant Commissioner (used by the RCMP)

 chief superintendent

 Chief Supt.

 staff superintendent

 Staff Supt.

 superintendent

 Supt.

 staff inspector

 Staff Insp.

 inspector

 Insp.

 sergeant major

 Sgt. Maj.

 staff sergeant 

 Staff Sgt.

 detective

 Det.

 sergeant

 Sgt.

 corporal

 Cpl.

 constable

 Const.


If someone is temporarily assigned to a rank that is abbreviated, (e.g., _acting Staff Sgt. Rick McKee or acting Insp. Laurie Smith_), **the word acting is lowercase** but the rank retains its initial capital letters.

If someone is temporarily assigned to a rank that is not abbreviated (e.g., _acting police chief Laurie Smith, acting deputy chief Rick McKee_), the word acting and the rank are both lowercase.

(See also [titles](/home/t/titles) for general guidelines on handling past and temporary positions, such as retired _general John de Chastelain_.)
**
We prefer the general term “police officer” over policeman or policewoman.

The word officer is acceptable for any rank on a given force.** (Police in Canada do not follow the military’s practice of clearly branding its members as commissioned or non-commissioned officers.)

See also [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

### Polls

**Polls**

**General guidelines**
**We do not report on all polls.** Among other things, **CBC News considers the source**. For instance, we do not cover "push" or "advocacy" polls (e.g., a survey about teachers' pensions conducted by a union representing teachers).

**CBC also looks at the methodology, amount of information available** on how questions were phrased **as well as the significance of the results**. To determine if a survey is scientific, we look at several factors including **the sample size, how people were chosen, the response rate and the margin of error**. (For example, the CBC's Research Department traditionally discourages reporting on polls with margins of error that are greater than 3.1. And even if overall poll results have acceptable margins of error, care must always be taken when certain breakdowns are looked at — e.g., national versus regional results — because smaller sample sizes may carry significantly larger margins of error.)

**It's normally OK to make a brief reference to a poll from a reputable organization** (e.g., "_The U.S. president's approval rating has dipped to its lowest level in two years, according to a new CNN survey_"), **as long as the source is transparently identified and the poll is deemed sound** based on CBC Research guidelines. **But before reporting on any poll in any depth** (i.e., as the main focus of a given story), **the CBC Research Department should be asked to assess the methodology and interpretation of results.** At the very least, a unit's senior journalists should be consulted before anyone writes about polls that have not already been reviewed by the main newsgathering desk and assigned to a CBC reporter.

**When writing about polls, be sure to follow specific rules about language and interpretation of data outlined in the CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices policies.** (See below)

**During election campaigns, it's also helpful to consult our detailed [election primer](/home/e/election-primer), which features a wide range of other guidelines** (e.g., how to refer to incumbents, organize political panels), including a summary of rules about commissioning polls, election day blackouts and election night coverage. **It summarizes why we limit coverage of "horse race" poll results.** There's also a section dealing with [unscientific surveys](/home/e/election-primer#unscientificsurveys), such as invitations for audience votes during broadcasts, and the need to avoid even implying that the results are representative.


**Language**
Public opinion **polls suggest, they do not "show."** Always attribute, and avoid language such as "indicate" or "show" when referring to the results.


> _The poll suggests support for XYZ has fallen about 10 percentage points._
>
> _Support for XYZ has fallen about 10 percentage points, according to the poll._

Be sure to **avoid mixing up [per cent and percentage](/home/p/per-cent-versus-percentage)**.

**Mandatory content**
**When writing about a poll, always mention:**

-   **Who conducted the survey** (e.g., the polling company as well as the organization that commissioned it).
-   **When** it took place.
-   **Who was surveyed** (e.g., teachers in Alberta, eligible voters across Canada, etc.)
-   The **number of people interviewed.**
-   The **margin of error** (e.g., "The results are considered accurate within 2.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20"), **unless it's an online survey** — since pollsters don't agree on the scientific validity of calculating margins of error unless a given sample is considered sufficiently random and representative. **In those cases, always contact the CBC's research department to see if there are any concerns about a given poll's methodology** or overall soundness before reporting the results.

**It's often helpful to include:**

-   **How questions were asked** (e.g., over the phone).
-   The **response rate** (i.e., the percentage of people contacted who agreed to take part).

If it's a political poll, **be sure to flag whether an organization with ties to a political party commissioned the survey.

For more tips and caveats about the mandatory content tied to polls**, including the meaning and the limitations of margins of error, **see the CBC Research Department's four-page [Poll Reporting Guide Sheet](/media/qe2eeik2/poll-reporting-guide-sheet_cb-a29d4cb8a12f2bc2.pdf)**.


**Focus**
**In straight news reporting, emphasize actual data over interpretation** of the numbers (e.g., "_The poll suggests support for XYZ is falling_" rather than why it's falling). See [interpretation](/home/p/polls#interpretation) below for more details about attributed opinion.

**Try to include context**, such as the results of other polls we've reported recently and trends over time, to help our audience understand the story.

**Never give the impression that polls are predictive.** They're snapshots taken at a specific moment in time and may, in fact, be unrepresentative. The results should be treated as such.


**Interpretation**
**In news stories, interpretation of surveys should come from experts we interview** (e.g., a pollster can talk about the methodology and general trends, a political scientist can weigh in with perspective and predictions, etc.). **Their remarks should be attributed.
**
**In content branded as analysis**, including election features such as the Canada Poll Tracker, **interpretation of surveys can be provided by qualified CBC News staff** (i.e., news employees with experience/expertise in the field).

**In columns, the views of the authors are often sufficient** as long as they're clearly identified as such.


**External links**
Given the nature of the web, it's a good idea to **provide whatever additional information we can on surveys in our online stories** (e.g., the exact wording of one or two questions, plus an external link to the research company's site that gives more background on the specific poll).


**Journalistic Standards and Practices**
For more information, see the CBC's [Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on polls](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fpolitics-1.4523351&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1JzlIMztzK0lZtiRHnpBNa), which includes an overview of general principles as well as specific, mandatory guidelines (e.g., pre-approval requirements for CBC-commissioned polls).

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ABOUT POLLS**
 Before writing about public opinion surveys, **make sure you're familiar with accepted industry standards about conducting polls and interpreting results** ― including how the margin of error can change drastically when attempting to extrapolate, say, provincial results from certain national surveys because the relevant sample size shrinks disproportionately. The CBC Research Department's 2017 [**Poll Reporting Guide Sheet**](/media/qe2eeik2/poll-reporting-guide-sheet_cb-a29d4cb8a12f2bc2.pdf) (PDF) is a good starting point.

 To help news organizations develop a critical eye when assessing whether to report polls, the U.S. National Council on Public Polls has created a document worth reading: [**20 questions a journalist should ask about poll results**](https://docs.google.com/a/radio-canada.ca/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2JjLmNhfGxhbmd1YWdlZ3VpZGV8Z3g6M2RjM2Y4MjIyZGRjZDY4Mw) (PDF). It hammers home the need to understand who asked what questions, when, how, etc.

### Ponzi versus pyramid scheme

**Ponzi versus pyramid scheme**

**In news stories, avoid describing simple pyramid schemes as Ponzi scams.** They're similar but not identical. **When defining Ponzi, it's OK to say it's a _pyramid-like scheme_** as long as details in the story make it clear how people were actually defrauded. This is based on conventional usage. **But it's wrong to call simple pyramid operations actual Ponzi scams.**

 **Only real similarity**A large number of people contribute to a pool of money that is moved around but never actually generates true returns on investment. This is essentially the only overlap.


**Main differences**

-   A true **Ponzi** scheme is managed by only a few con artists (often only one). This individual or small group is actively conspiring to defraud everyone else. Chronology is irrelevant (i.e., when a person joins).
-   A **pyramid** scheme is a trickling-down process. Profits are not limited to the original organizers but, rather, depend on which level of the pyramid a person is on (i.e., whether you're an early participant or a latecomer). An entry fee is often charged for the right to participate.
-   A **pyramid** scheme depends on a steady stream of new recruits, actively sought after by recently signed up members. A **Ponzi** scheme can be sustained for a longer period without new recruits if the original fraudster(s) can keep tricking current participants into "reinvesting" their earnings.

**Definitions optional**
The term Ponzi scheme became fairly well known in 2008-09, given extensive coverage of the Bernard Madoff case cited below. So **in the same way that we don't need to define the common label _pyramid scheme_, we don't necessarily need to define _Ponzi_** (which also happens to be in the dictionary). **Just make sure the story's details are clear enough to let our audience know what sort of fraud was committed** (or is _alleged_ to have been committed, if the case is still under investigation or before the courts). On the web, internal links to background features, glossaries, etc., are a good way of offering extra detail. On air, promoting in-depth web content can be highly effective.


**Details and examples**
**Ponzi scheme**
A true **Ponzi scheme** involves a very small number of masterminds who trick others into believing that they're making a profit from legitimate investments. It's often only one con artist. In reality, cash is simply stolen and moved around, with the swindler paying one group a portion of the money invested by others. No returns are actually earned, although some participants may technically profit if they persuade the mastermind(s) to let them withdraw all original investments after they've already received bogus earnings (which were probably paid to "investors" only as an incentive to plow in more money). There is actually **no suggestion of a pyramid structure** to those fooled. They are **not asked to recruit people** or do any other work. **Their returns are not dependent on when they begin injecting money into the scam.** They are simply asked for cash and promised good returns (usually an unrealistically high amount) in the masquerade.


> **Example:** In New York, disgraced financier **Bernard Madoff** was sentenced in 2009 to the maximum 150 years behind bars for fleecing hundreds of investors out of tens of billions of dollars in a **massive Ponzi scheme**. Madoff had encouraged thousands of people to invest huge sums of money over many years. Investigators said he created fictitious account statements that claimed big profits were being made. But Madoff didn’t actually trade securities or made other bona fide investments. Instead, he simply kept, spent or passed on to others large amounts of the money.


**Pyramid scheme**
By contrast, a **pyramid scheme** generally involves more than the original masterminds making money from others’ investments on a trickle-down basis. In fact, **many of the early participants in a pyramid scam automatically profit from the cash paid by those who join later.** How much of the total pot an individual can possibly collect before there's no new money coming in depends on when the person joins. **Chronology, in other words, is crucial** — especially since people are often asked to pay some sort of fee for the right to participate. Simple pyramids are sometimes marketed as such, with **people encouraged to rise through the ranks by recruiting others**. Again, there are no true earnings from investments. Money is simply moved around until the scheme collapses.


> Example: In California, eight women were charged with fraud in 2002 with what authorities said was a $12 million **pyramid scheme**. According to police, investors were invited to Women Helping Women parties in beauty salons and residences and promised a chance to make money. At each party, a “birthday girl” would receive up to $40,000. The money came from participants, who had to pay $5,000 each for the right to attend future parties. Each person counted on eventually celebrating her own $40,000 “birthday.” For many, however, the big cheque never came.

### pope

**Pope versus pope**
[Pope](/home/p/pope#capitalized) (capitalized; roman numerals not needed)
[interregnum](/home/p/pope#interregnum) (after the Pope's death)
[pope](/home/p/pope#lowercase) (lowercase) 


**Pope**
**Capitalize all references to the current head of the Roman Catholic Church:**

> _Pope Francis waved at the crowd._
>
> _The Pope will visit Canada next month._
>
> _Pope Francis's age is irrelevant, she said._


See [plural possessives](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s) for related guidelines (_the witness's testimony, a business's profits, Charles's horse_)

**Generally _avoid_ the term Holy Father** except in direct quotes (i.e., transcribed clips).

> _The Pope talked to them for more than three hours._
>
> _"The Holy Father needs to rest," a Vatican spokesperson said._


**Roman numerals are not required for Francis:** Pope Francis (NOT Francis I)


There has been only one Pope Francis. The name chosen by Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio in March 2013. Until there's a Francis II, the papal name Francis alone is sufficient.


**Roman numerals rarely needed for recent popes**
**Even for past popes, roman numerals are often not required, especially in headlines or second reference.**

When papal names have been used before, roman numerals are rarely needed when referring to recent pontiffs (e.g., _Pope Benedict_ instead of _Pope Benedict XVI_, unless there's reason to believe there would be confusion with, say, Benedict XV's papacy, which ended in 1922).

**On the rare occasion when the same papal name appears in one story, use roman numerals for clarity:**

> _John Paul II became pontiff in October 1978, about three weeks after John Paul I's unexpected death._


**For former pontiffs, capitalize Pope only before a single papal name**
**Use an uppercase "P" for former popes only when the title appears directly in front of one name:**

> _Pope Leo XIII_
>
> _The last pope to issue such a decree was Leo XIII._


**In plural, always use a lowercase "p" even before the name:**

> _... popes John Paul II, Pius XII, and Benedict XV._

**
If the former pope is still living, use [pope emeritus](/home/p/pope#emeritus)** or less lofty synonyms (e.g., retired pope) as outlined below.


**interregnum (after the Pope's death)**
**During the start of an interregnum** (after the Pope has died but before a replacement has been chosen), **continue to use an uppercase "P"** in all references since mourners are honouring "the" Pope not "a" pope:

> _The Pope's funeral will be held on Friday._


But after his body has been buried avoid calling him simply "the Pope." At this point, prefer his papal name, either with or without the title:

> _The conclave began about a week after Pope John Paul II's funeral._
>
> _In his final days, John Paul had trouble speaking._
>
> _The late Pope John Paul wrote about his illness in his will._


**pope**
Unless immediately followed by a name (e.g., Pope Leo XIII), **use a lowercase "p" when referring to former popes** (including the recently deceased pontiff once a successor is picked). Also, **use a lowercase "p" for general references to popes** (including a not-yet-chosen successor during the interregnum).

> _The conclave to pick a new pope had been expected to last at least two days._
>
> _Most Roman Catholic popes have been Italian._


**pope emeritus**
**In 2013, Benedict XVI became the first pope to voluntarily resign in almost 600 years.** Until his death in December 2022, he was officially known as the "roman pontiff emeritus" at the Vatican. **In our journalism, Benedict was referred to in various ways**, depending on the story's context and writer's preference. Here are some examples:

> _retired pope Benedict XVI_ (roman numerals optional)
>
> _former pope Benedict XVI_ (roman numerals optional)
>
> _pope emeritus Benedict XVI_ (roman numerals optional)
>
> _retired pope Benedict_
>
> _former pope Benedict_
>
> _pope emeritus Benedict_
>
> _the pope emeritus_

**
The modifier emeritus** — Latin for "a recognition (or merit) from service" — **is conventionally used after the noun** (e.g., pope emeritus, professor emeritus, archbishop emeritus of Montreal), **but can also be placed in front** (e.g., the emeritus pope). The latter construction sometimes makes editorial sense, especially in certain broadcast scripts (e.g., in a 2018 story about Pope Francis that made reference to Benedict XVI, putting emeritus in front of his name helped instantly underscore we meant the former pontiff).

> _emeritus pope Benedict XVI_ (roman numerals optional)
>
> _emeritus pope Benedict_
>
> _the emeritus pope_


**Since "pope emeritus" is more familiar than "emeritus pope," it's our preferred style.** But use your own judgment about what works best in a given story. Since the possessive of pope emeritus is **pope emeritus's** (see [s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s) for details), it's often easiest to recast with the noun pope at the end (e.g., the former pope's, the past pope's, Benedict's or the emeritus pope's).

Bear in mind that **when citing past events (recent or historical), the most conversational way to refer to previous popes is to** avoid terms like former, retired, past, deceased, emeritus, etc., and simply **put a sentence into context with a time element** tied to when the person was still pontiff:

> _Pope Gregory XII stepped down in 1415_
>
> _The College of Cardinals met for first time since Pope Benedict's resignation last week_


In each sentence above, the person was still pope at the time (Gregory in 1415, and Benedict the week he resigned). See [past versus present](/home/t/titles#droppingformer) in the titles overview entry for related guidelines


**pontiff, papal, papacy**
Derivatives (e.g., _papal_ and _papacy_) are always lowercase, along with terms used as synonyms for official titles, such as _pontiff_.

**Pornography, porn**

[Traditional usage OK](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/p/pornography/#traditionalusage "Pornography") (porn film, porn star)
[Certain figurative usage fine](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/p/pornography/#figurativeusage "Pornography") (food porn, weather porn)

**Traditional usage OK**
There's **no universal definition of pornography, commonly called porn.** The English version of the word was coined in the 1840s, shortly after photography was invented. It was based on a French term for "obscene painting," which, in turn, came from an ancient Greek expression that's generally translated as "writing about prostitutes." The etymology, in other words, is directly tied to money and sex.

**Porn now conventionally refers to a range of explicit material of a sexual nature, including video, photos and text**, that's associated with carnal lust rather than artistic, aesthetic eroticism. It's often created by, and for, men, and is frequently criticized by opponents who say it objectifies women. Deciding what's pornography and what's art can be highly subjective, however, as noted in this [2019 CBC feature](https://www.cbc.ca/arts/art-101-what-s-the-difference-between-porn-and-art-1.5062752) on evolving societal mores.

In news stories, **the terms porn and pornography are generally OK when referring to the commercial production of nude or sexually explicit material that involves consenting adults, and that lacks intrinsic artistic value**. Although the last clause is vague and, so, open to debate, traditional interpretation provides broad direction. For example, a Penthouse photo layout is usually called pornography, while a sex scene in a movie shown at the Toronto International Film Festival is usually considered art, whether well or poorly crafted. There is, of course, overlap. Gratuitous and/or bawdy sex scenes in popular cable TV dramas might be called "soft porn" by some.

Compounds such as **porn actor, porn actress, and porn star are common and acceptable synonyms for adult film actor** when the facts fit. Coverage of the [Stormy Daniels story](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2018/2018-05-28/ "2018 05 28") during Donald Trump's presidency illustrates options. But **be mindful of the difference between professionals who describe themselves as porn stars and amateurs who are branded in hurtful ways** based on a few photos or images that have surfaced online. Also bear in mind that word choice affects a story's overall tone, and that labels can be dehumanizing — as outlined in our entry on [prostitute, sex trade worker, etc.](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/p/prostitute/ "Prostitute") Use editorial judgment.


**Certain figurative usage fine** (food porn, weather porn)
Since the 1970s, the clipped term porn has also been used in **compounds that have nothing to do with sex** (e.g., **disaster porn, food porn, grief porn, horror porn, weather porn**). The implication is that this material is intended to be as titillating as words or images about sex.

**Such entrenched colloquialisms are normally fine**. Exceptions are stories focused on sexual exploitation and abuse, where use of the word "porn" so blithely would be unsuitable.


**Avoid 'revenge porn' unless attributed**
The term "**revenge porn**," coined in the early 1990s, **originally referred to a subgenre of action films that featured extremely violent or highly sensational revenge plots**, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. **By 2007, however, the expression was being applied to the vindictive act of uploading nude, semi-nude or sexually explicit images of someone to the internet without the person's permission**, usually after a couple's relationship had ended. The label quickly caught on, but a decade later activists began calling for different wording that better conveyed the true nature of what amounts to cyber assault and sexual abuse.

CBC News agrees that **the compound "revenge porn" can be misleading**. First, **the modifier "revenge" seemingly blames the victim** for the unauthorized, unwanted distribution of revealing personal images by stressing the perpetrator's perceived self-justification (along the lines of a "revenge killing"). Second, **the noun "porn" mischaracterizes the intimate videos or photos being leaked** by wrongly insinuating that the material was actually created as the equivalent of commercial pornography.

For this reason, **references to "revenge porn" in stories should be limited and attributed** (e.g., directly transcribed clips or proper noun equivalents, such as an organization's Revenge Porn Helpline).

There's currently **no pithy, clear and neutral synonym**. Language such as "**non-consensual intimate image sharing**" can be used in stories, especially when quoting from academic studies, legislation and other government documents, like the Canadian Department of Justice's 2013 report: [Cyberbullying and the Non-consensual Distribution of Intimate Images](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/pcipnyma/cndii-cdncii-eng_dept-of-justice_canada_june-2013.pdf "Cyberbulling_Cdncii_Dept Of Justice Canada June 2013")[.](/umbraco#/media/media/edit/15425) But **be aware that this sort of phrasing is often so thick and mushy that it can obscure the pain suffered by victims** ― sounding more like a “sharing” copyright violation than a vicious and devastating cyber assault that leaves individuals traumatized and publicly humiliated.

One option is to use words like "abuse" or "betrayal" to encapsulate the sense of malevolent, non-consensual distribution, as in "**intimate image betrayal,**" and then to report whatever facts apply to a given case in conversational English (e.g., "**posted a sex tape they had made without her permission**," or "**published some nude pictures of her without consent**").

NOTE: The above entry deals with material recorded by consenting adults. For stories about the production, possession and distribution of unlawful videos or images of minors, see [**child pornography**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/child_pornography/ "Child_pornography").


### Prairies

**Prairie versus prairie**

**Keep the generic word “prairie” lowercase unless referring to all or part of the specific region** that runs from southeastern Alberta through southern Saskatchewan and into southwestern Manitoba. (These are the **three Prairie provinces**.)

Some common constructions:

> Prairie provinces
>
> the Prairies
>
> It looked like a prairie field.
>
> The prairie stretched as far as the eye could see.
>
> Their Prairie farm is for sale.
>
> A prairie snake.
>
> Snakes are multiplying on Canada’s Prairies.


Note: Do not apply the U.S. term “Midwest” to Canada.

### Prepositions at the end of sentences

**Prepositions at the end of sentences**

If you believe a sentence looks or sounds better with a preposition at the end, write it that way. Grammarians won't quarrel. In fact many will applaud.

**Not only is it harmless to end on a preposition, it's also natural** — an important consideration for writers at the CBC who have their words read aloud on radio and television. Consider the following sentences:

"She refused to come _in_."

"What's the world coming to?"

"This is a point people still fight _over_."


**'A ridiculous affectation'**
If **ending a sentence with a preposition is perfectly acceptable**, why do so many people assume it's wrong?

**The myth appears to have started with an influential book by an 18th-century bishop**, Robert Lowth, according to Bill Bryson's The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words.

In Lowth's Short Introduction to English Grammar, the "gentleman grammarian" urged his readers to be polite by avoiding prepositions at the end of their sentences if they possibly could. To Lowth, for example, writing "this is something you should go to" was less appealing than "this is something to which you should go."

"Too many people took him too literally and for a century and a half the notion held sway," Bryson says. "Today, happily, it is universally condemned as a ridiculous affectation."

The late novelist Kingsley Amis was a bit harsher, calling the rule "one of those fancied prohibitions dear to ignorant slobs."

### Problems with pronouns

## Problems with pronouns

In news stories, there are **THREE COMMON MISTAKES with pronouns**.


**1\. Inappropriate gender** **('her' engine rather than 'its' engine)**

**For people, use known and preferred pronouns.** When referring to [t](/home/t/transgender)[ransgender](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#pronouns "Transgender") people, this may include adopting the [plural "they" as a singular](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/they_singular/ "They_singular"), rather than the traditional binary choices of "she/her/hers" or "he/him/his."

**For other life** (fauna, flora, etc.), **including most animals, use it and its.** The only exceptions are references to animals with established gender, such as a pet. In those cases, binary singular pronouns are OK (e.g., "scratched her ears" and "wagged his tail").

**For inanimate objects, including ships, planes, automobiles, guns, etc., use it and its.** Sometimes, we interview people who prefer "she" or "he" in these contexts (e.g., the nautical tradition of using female pronouns for some vessels). While this usage is fine in directly transcribed quotes, use it and its outside of quotes, including in paraphrases (e.g., "its engine" rather than "her engine").


**2\. Wrong word** **('they' rather than 'it')**
In Britain, words such as “**company**” and “**government**” are frequently treated as collective nouns that can be plural or singular. But in Canada such constructions (the “company are” and the “government have”) are generally viewed as wrong. **CBC News treats these words as singular**, which means we use the pronoun “it” not “they.”


> _The **company** has been losing money for the past two years. But **they’ve** come up with a plan to try to increase sales._

> Since the word company is singular, the second sentence should be: "_But **it’s** come up with a plan …_"

> The **_government_** is planning to introduce new legislation this fall. **They** hope the expanded food protection program will be in place by the end of the year.

> Since the word government is singular, the second sentence should be: “_It hopes the expanded …_”


For a more detailed look at collective nouns that can be singular or plural (e.g., couple and family) see [verb agreement.](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/v/verb-agreement/ "Verb agreement")


**3\. Ambiguity** **(Does 'he' refer to Smith or Williams?)**
**Guard against muddy meaning. Rewrite as required.**


> _Turner will meet Wong on Friday. **He** asked for the meeting to get more details about the proposed merger._
>
> Who asked for the meeting? Turner or Wong?
>
> _The witness testified that after Smith talked to Williams, **he** ran out of the building screaming that **he** planned to kill him._
>
> Who ran out of the building? Smith? Williams? The witness? And was “he” running away scared or running away in a mad fit threatening murder?


**When you use _they, he, her, it_, etc. make sure that the identity of the person or thing is 100 per cent clear** or rewrite the sentence. **The easiest solution is to repeat the noun** (e.g., Smith or Williams). **Breaking up long confusing sentences is always helpful too:**


> _The witness said Smith talked to Williams the day of the murder. According to her testimony, **Smith** then ran out of the building screaming that **Williams** planned to hill him._


Writers often have alternatives. In this example, a term such as “the accused” would work in place of the first “Williams” if it’s clear from the story that Williams is on trial. Otherwise, repeat the name Williams as shown.

### Prostitute

**Prostitute, sex-trade worker, etc.**

Clarity, neutrality and relevance help guide us when we choose language to describe women or men who receive payment for sexual services.


**Clarity and neutrality**
**The term "prostitute" is often the first choice because it's clearest.** The word is common and direct without being glib or glamorous. Despite some objections to the word, prostitute is an entrenched part of everyday writing and speech. As a verb, in fact, its meaning has widened to include people who sell themselves in a figurative rather than in a literal sense (e.g., "Art critics say the painter is prostituting his skills").

**The term "sex-trade worker" is also OK, although it's comparatively roundabout and vague.** Technically, people who answer phones at brothels also work in the sex trade. So do prostitutes' chauffeurs, [porn stars](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/p/pornography/ "Pornography") and so forth. In our journalism, **if a woman or man wants to be known as a sex-trade worker, we generally follow that preference, as long as the context of the story makes the meaning clear.** We do not adopt euphemisms to cloud what can be a very gritty reality.

**Do not use pejorative terms like "whore." And generally avoid colloquial words such as "hooker" in routine news coverage** because the tone is often inappropriate. **Terms such as "escort" or "streetwalker" may be OK in second reference**, depending on whether the context makes the facts clear. For example, if a story focuses on traffic jams in a red-light district, the term "streetwalker" might be suitable.

**The word "john"** (lowercase) **is acceptable and widely understood**, but since the tone is very informal **it's often preferable to use "client" or "customer."** People arrested for solicitation are sometimes asked to attend "john schools."


**Relevance**
**Labels can be dehumanizing.** In a story about murdered women, for instance, it's important to include the accused killer's relationship with the victims (e.g., police say they were hitchhikers, police say they were working as prostitutes). But it's insensitive and unnecessary to repeatedly refer to the missing or dead women as prostitutes throughout a story. In other words, **terms such as "prostitute" and "sex-trade worker" must be used with care and for specific editorial reasons.**

### protest

**Protest, protest against; avoid protest 'for'**

**The word protest means to express opposition or disapproval****, whether a noun** ("a protest on Parliament Hill") **a verb** ("they protest the recent pension cuts") **or a modifier** ("a protest vote"). Even in the infrequent sense of a solemn oath ("to protest one's innocence") or in phrasing that echoes Shakespeare ("critics say he protests too much"), dissent, disavowal or other forms of disagreement are central.


**This fact has a bearing on which prepositions** (by, over, under) **we pick in certain contexts**:

[protest against](/home/p/protest#protest_against) (common and fine)
[protest 'for'](/home/p/protest#protest_for) (discouraged, if not actually nonsensical)
[by, over, under, etc.
](/home/p/protest#protest_by_over)

## **Protest against**

**It's a myth that "protest against" should be avoided** because "against" is already implied by the verb. **The construction is entrenched and acceptable**, going back more than a century in North America. **It's also a myth that "protest" cannot be used intransitively. The verb may or may not take a direct object**, depending on the choice of the writer or speaker:


> They **_protested_** NATO-led bombing. (TRANSITIVE VERB)
>
> They **_protested against_** the war. (INTRANSITIVE VERB)


**Either construction is fine.** The first illustrates protest as transitive verb because the focus of the action is a direct object: the bombing. The second illustrates protest as an intransitive verb because it's followed by a prepositional phrase ("against the war") rather than by a direct object.

## **Protest 'for'**

**Avoid "protest for" as a synonym for championing a given cause.** Since protest means to oppose, it's odd and potentially confusing to use the word this way. **To keep sentences clear, pick a different verb** with a broader meaning (e.g., **fight for, lobby for, campaign for**).

For instance, people can fight for free trade and protest against protectionism, but it's not instantly clear how people can "protest for" free trade. **When we adopt the verb "protest" in the context of arguing "for" something** instead of arguing against it,, **we gain nothing but risk jarring some in our audience** — who are left wondering how one can express opposition "for" something. **To many, it's as foreign as saying "promote against."**

In the relatively rare, narrow sense of advocacy, of course, **"protest for" is perfectly acceptable when "for" means on behalf of someone** (e.g., to protest for abused children).

## **By, over, under, etc.**

**Careful writers pay attention to the prepositions they pair with protest.** Here are some distinctions worth observing:


> **protest against** (to voice disapproval; demonstrate opposition) NOTE: "Protest against" is **almost always recommended over "protest of"** and other comparatively vague and unorthodox constructions because "against" better underscores the sense of opposition to something (e.g., "a protest against the mine" instead of "a protest of the mine").
>
> **protest by** (to identify participants, such as students, workers).
>
> **protest for** (to demonstrate on behalf of someone; otherwise avoid for [reasons outlined above](/home/p/protest#protest_against)).
>
> **protest over** (to identify a campaign's cause; to specify what's being opposed, such as budget cuts, war). NOTE: **protest about** is OK, too, especially when "protest" is a noun (e.g., "two protests about pipelines").
>
> **under protest** (to do something unwillingly).


Other constructions commonly describe dates, times, physical locations and conditions (**protest in, protest on, protest at**), as in a "protest in the rain" and a "protest at noon." For this reason, the compounds "protest over" or "protest about" are generally better than the sometimes-used "**protest at**" when specifying the theme or purpose of a demonstration: "A protest over sex education curriculum."

For consistency, **use the spelling protester** instead of "protestor."

### protester

**Protest, protester**

**Both are generally good default choices** when covering different types of demonstrations.

## Protest

**Protest is a clear, common and neutral noun**, often used in its attributive form (e.g., "a protest march"). It's also a broad  term, which means that **reporting specific facts about a given protest are important**. Are people on the move? Is a road or bridge being blocked? Have police been called?

There's **no time limit to protests.** A rally might wrap up after a few hours, but a hunger strike could last days or weeks, and some past anti-logging demonstrations have gone on for months. They're all considered protests.

**Be mindful of unintended meaning when considering synonyms.**

**Demonstration** is common and acceptable across the board, although the clipped form "demo" can introduce a casual tone that may not match a given story.

**Rally** generally implies a peaceful gathering where supporters have gathered to listen to speeches (e.g., a political rally). Given its close association with positive movement upward (e.g., a stock price rally, a trailing team's rally to win a game, an ill patient's sudden recovery), **rally is usually not a good choice to describe controversial protests involving violence or threats of violence**, confrontations with authorities, etc.

**Standoff** is fine when there's an impasse between protesters and authorities, or between two different groups (e.g., protesters and counter-protesters).

**Blockade** is suitable when vehicles and people are prevented from travelling forward (e.g., a road blockade, a bridge blockage, a rail blockade). If traffic is merely slowed, stories should make this clear (e.g., a **partial blockade** of a border crossing).

Other specific labels are OK as long as the facts match, including various nouns formed out of verbs (e.g., **march, sit-in, walkout**).

**Attribute contestable terms, such as "occupation," unless the facts incontrovertibly match** (e.g., an MP's office has been taken over and locked). The word occupation normally implies more than merely trespassing or, say, a few vehicles blocking some downtown streets. Occupation generally conveys the sense that one or more people effectively control access to a given area, have set up camps to live in, and are preventing authorities, journalists and passersby from walking into the space without permission. So while a protest can occupy one or more streets for an extended period, the demonstration, itself, is not necessarily an "occupation." **NOTE: If some protesters dig in for days or weeks, refusing to leave roadways or land that isn't theirs, despite repeated requests by authorities to move on, then the noun "occupation" might apply without attribution. In those cases, however, it's still important to be precise to avoid misleading phrasing** (e.g., "an occupation of some streets around Parliament Hill" rather than the "Ottawa occupation"). If uncertain whether the language is accurate, check with your supervisor. 

## Protester

**Protester is considered a neutral, fact-based description of anyone demonstrating for or against something**  — from environmental critics opposing government policy to human rights supporters rallying to defend victims of violence. **Demonstrator is common and fine as a synonym** for protester, but note that the suffixes are spelled differently (i.e., _\-or_ versus _\-er_).

Be aware that some activists object to the term "protester" in certain contexts, such as when they're on their own land fighting annexation or development. Our core journalistic principles of accuracy, fairness and impartiality guide us. **We don't adopt one side's preferred terminology** (e.g., "land defenders" or "environmental champions") **without attribution for the same reason we don't adopt another side's terminology** (e.g., "injunction violators" or "pipeline obstructionists") without attribution.

**There's no reason to insist on the word protester in all cases**, as long as fact-based, neutral alternatives exists (e.g., "landowner" instead of "protester" in a dispute over property rights). **But "protester" is often a good choice when demonstrations go beyond mere public rallies, and start disrupting the livelihoods of ordinary citizens** (e.g., traffic jams, bridge closures, railway blockades, office occupations).

Our core journalistic principles of accuracy, fairness and impartiality guide us. **We don't adopt one side's preferred terminology** (e.g., "land defenders" or "environmental champions") **without attribution for the same reason we don't adopt another side's terminology** (e.g., "injunction violators" or "pipeline obstructionists") without attribution.

**There's no reason to insist on the word protester in all cases**, as long as fact-based, neutral alternatives exists (e.g., "landowner" instead of "protester" in a dispute over property rights). **But "protester" is often a good choice when demonstrations go beyond mere public rallies, and start disrupting the livelihoods of ordinary citizens** (e.g., traffic jams, bridge closures, railway blockades, office occupations).

### Provinces and cities

**Provinces, territories and cities**

[Abbreviating](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#abbreviating) (Alta., not AB)

[Alternative forms and spellings](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#alternative-spellings) (Magdalen Islands not Îles-de-la-Madeleine)

**Abbreviating**

**NOTE: This section focuses on standard text in stories**, including headlines, subheads, photo captions and the main bodies of web articles. **Maps, graphics, etc., sometimes require more condensed abbreviations**, as noted below.


**With the exception of** British Columbia **(B.C.)**, Prince Edward Island **(P.E.I.) and** the Northwest Territories **(N.W.T.), do not abbreviate provincial or territorial names unless they appear after cities, towns or other communities in the body of a story:**


> _They bought a farm near Estevan, Sask., in 1955.
> __She was born in Quebec in 1970.
> __He died in a plane crash near Fort McPherson, N.W.T., three years ago._


**In these cases, always use a comma after the community and a second comma after the province or territory. NOTE: When the geographical reference is used as compound adjective, however, it's generally best to recast the sentence** so that the second comma doesn't disrupt the sentence's flow.


> _They started a Surrey, B.C., company that created jobs for dozens of ..._ (OK but somewhat jarring)
> _They started a company in Surrey, B.C., that created jobs for dozens of ..._ (Preferred)


**Never shorten [Yukon](/home/y/yukon) or Nunavut:**


> _They plan to visit **Yukon** this summer.
> The fire began at the base of a mountain near **Faro, Yukon**, a community of about 500 people.
> She married an Inuk artist and moved to **Pangnirtung, Nunavut**, in 1988._


**When abbreviations are appropriate, use the following:
**

> **Alta.** (Alberta)
> **B.C.** (British Columbia)
> **Sask.** (Saskatchewan)
> **Man.** (Manitoba)
> **Ont.** (Ontario)
> **Que.** (Quebec)
> **N.B.** (New Brunswick)
> **N.S.** (Nova Scotia)
> **P.E.I.** (Prince Edward Island, [the Island](/home/i#island) in later references)
> **N.L.** ([Newfoundland and Labrador](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador)), but see the note about web headlines below

> **Nunavut** (no abbreviation - see above)

> **N.W.T.** (Northwest Territories, _not_ "North West")

> **Yukon** (no abbreviation - see above)


**Never drop the periods in this geographical shorthand.** Standard abbreviations for provinces and territories include punctuation (e.g., Alta., Ont. and N.L.), according to the Geographical Names Board of Canada (GNBC). Postal code "symbols" (AB, ON and NL), by contrast, do not. Details can be found on page 36 (appendix 8) of the GNBC's booklet, [Principles and Procedures for Geographical Naming](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/if1lijp4/gnbc_principles-and-procedure-a616765edcebb503.pdf "GNBC_Principles-and-Procedure-a616765edcebb503.pdf"). **We prefer standard geographical abbreviations in our journalism rather than postal code shorthand.** This matches the official style at all major news organizations across the country, including CP. It's also the recommended style for all federal government departments, as outlined in [The Canadian Style manual](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca%2Ftcdnstyl-chap%3Flang%3Deng%26lettr%3Dchapsect1%26info0%3D1.09&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gPrm0CwETjsdHJwn75Tu1) published by Public Works Canada.

See also the [**abbreviations overview**](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents) for guidelines on handling geographical components of proper nouns (e.g., B.C. Hydro but WorkSafeBC).

**In web headlines**, provincial abbreviations are often used to save space. But they're not mandatory (e.g., Alberta or Alta. are both fine). **Do not shorten Yukon or Nunavut. Do not abbreviate Canada or Canadian** outside of currency references (see [Money](/home/m/money#CdnUS) for details). The abbreviation **Nfld.** is sometimes used in web headlines, but only in rare cases when referring to the island itself (e.g., "southern Nfld," spelled out as "southern Newfoundland" in the main story). Otherwise, the shorthand is [N.L.](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador) **Labrador is never abbreviated when used on its own**, even in web headlines.

**In maps and other graphics**, **two-character "postal" abbreviations are acceptable because of severe space constraints.** For consistency, follow official shorthand established in a given region (e.g., [Canada Post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canadapost.ca%2Ftools%2Fpg%2Fmanual%2FPGaddress-e.asp%3Fecid%3Dmurl10006450&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0uGjYJduIsr9rYPKHHsn11), the [U.S. Postal Service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpe.usps.com%2Ftext%2Fpub28%2F28apb.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0O24qE5qIEDxSJH_WXvCUX)). This means AB and MB for Alberta and Manitoba, and AL and MA for Alabama and Massachusetts in maps, graphics, etc. Be aware that two-character postal short forms have no periods or other punctuation because they're treated as "symbols" rather than true abbreviations, along the lines of km for kilometre. For instance, the two-character symbol for British Columbia is BC rather than B.C., and the two-character symbol for North Dakota is ND rather than N.D.


**Alternative forms and spellings**
**We normally use one spelling of geographical names across platforms.** It often boils down to accuracy (e.g., the Ontario city of St. Catharines has only one "e" and no possessive apostrophe). But occasionally there are competing, equally correct forms, and we pick a preference (e.g., senior CBC News management in Quebec recommends [Magdalen Islands](/home/m#Magdalen_Islands) instead of Îles-de-la-Madeleine based on entrenched English usage).

**In rare cases, a geographical name may depend on the context and platform.** For instance, a conurbation such as Kitchener-Waterloo (also known as the separate Ontario cities of Kitchener and Waterloo), as well as [Minneapolis-St. Paul](/home/m#Minneapolis) (also known as the separate Minnesota cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul) may or may not feature the conjunction "and." The same is true of an archipelago like [St-Pierre-Miquelon](/home/s#St-Pierre-Miquelon), which might be read on air differently as either St-Pierre-et-Miquelon (with the French conjunction "et"), or even as Saint Pierre and Miquelon (with the English conjunction "and," the hyphens dropped and "Saint" spelled out). **In other words, there is a degree of latitude with certain proper nouns, especially if adding or removing hyphens, conjunctions, etc., makes broadcast scripts more conversational.** The main criterion is whether the specific form chosen is already entrenched as an alternative.


**Web stories: Montreal but 'Milk River, Alta.,'**
**Since online articles are often read by people outside a given province or territory, it's important to make the story's location clear. Never assume that context will automatically be provided for our audience.**

For instance, a headline is also a "headlink" on its own (appearing in lists of other headlines on various web pages, portable devices, etc.). People will not have the benefit of seeing the lead, a photo or anything else that could shed extra light on the headline's wording. So the headlink must be as clear as possible on its own. A story may also be simultaneously displayed on various CBCNews.ca pages (e.g., in the online service's national lineup) rather than just on a given regional site. This means that surrounding clues, such as a provincial banner or other geographical marker, may not be present for a substantial percentage of our audience.

Instead of using placelines (uppercase indicators, such as SURREY, B.C., that suggest a writer is actually filing from that particular community), **CBCNews.ca identifies the specific province high up —usually in the headline, deck** (secondary headline) **or lead**. Local readers who already know this information will generally accept that the news is being presented to a national or global audience. Everyone else will benefit from the extra detail.

**In a headline, only the province** (B.C.) **or municipality** (Surrey) **needs to be included.

In the main body of the story, however, most Canadian communities must be identified by more than their name. We generally add the province or territory** (Surrey, B.C.), **even if this detail is already in the headline:**

> _They drove to Milk River, Alta., on Saturday._


**Exceptions are made for well-known spots** (_She moved to Montreal in 1969_ ), **as well as for other places when the story has already established the location.** If a piece focuses on aid to farmers hurt by a severe drought in southern Saskatchewan, for example, we can write _Moose Jaw_ (instead of _Moose Jaw, Sask._,) midway through the copy:

> _Some crops near Moose Jaw were wiped out by hail._

**
Canadian cities that do not need provincial or territorial names after them:**


> Calgary
>
> Charlottetown
>
> Edmonton
>
> Fredericton
>
> Halifax
>
> Hamilton
>
> Iqaluit
>
> Montreal
>
> Ottawa
>
> Quebec City
>
> Regina
>
> [Saint John](/home/s#SaintJ)
>
> Saskatoon
>
> [St. John's](/home/s#StJ)
>
> Toronto
>
> Vancouver
>
> Victoria
>
> Whitehorse
>
> Winnipeg
>
> Yellowknife


**If a story is focused on a community other than those listed above and you don't want to add a provincial abbreviation after the name, another option is to provide a reference to a well-known city** that fills in the blanks (e.g., "east of Vancouver" or "north of Halifax").

**Generic words such as city, town and village are generally kept lowercase** (e.g., "near the town of Biggar, Sask.") But on rare occasions when we're referring to the proper legal name of a community (e.g., in a lawsuit against "the City of Calgary"), then a capital letter is required. See the separate entries on [City](/home/c#city), [Town](/home/t#town) and [Village](/home/v#village) for other examples.

**Spellings and maps
****For the spellings of domestic place names** (cities, towns, lakes, rivers, etc.), **consult the [Canadian Geographical Names Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf)** published by Natural Resources Canada. To find the spot on a map, go to the federal government's [Atlas of Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcan.gc.ca%2Fearth-sciences%2Fgeography%2Fatlas-canada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2KYnGQVzp6PBFC51ieot7A).

**In rare cases, geographical names are known by more than one spelling.** When a local preference has clearly become entrenched (e.g., the [**St. John River**](/home/s/st-saint-ste) instead of the "Saint John River" in New Brunswick), we adopt this conventional spelling if there's other official support for it (e.g., the provincial government uses St. John River most of the time). Such exceptions are listed in this intranet site's A to Z index.

**For communities outside of Canada, we rely on the National Geographic Atlas of the World**, but check the Language Guide for any spelling exceptions first (e.g., we write Bangkok, Dunkirk and _Taipei_). These exceptions are often English versions of local spellings that have become entrenched over time (e.g., _Rome_ instead of _Roma_).

**Q** 

**_Q_** (CBC Radio program) Launched as **_Q_** in 2007, the name was formally changed to lowercase _**q**_ from 2015 until early 2021. It's since been officially rebranded with a capital _Q_. For consistency, **use _Q_** in all references to the program, regardless of the specific year cited. See also [CBC](/home/c/cbc#unorthodox_typography) and [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**Q&A** (no hyphens or spaces) The abbreviation stands for the singular **question and answer** (n.), and **question-and-answer** (adj.), as in a Q&A session. The plural is **Q&As**, akin to VIPs and FAQs. (See also [ampersand](/home/a/ampersand))

**qamutik** (Inuit sled towed behind a snowmobile or dog team) Use this spelling, not "komatik" or other variations.

**Qatar**

**QR code** (fine in first reference) Stands for "quick response code," but the abbreviation is now virtually never spelled out. QR codes typically contain text and numerical data that can be read by various devices, including smartphone apps. The now-ubiquitous squares filled with tiny monochromatic block patterns were first used in Japan in the mid-1990s.

**Q-Tips** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for cotton swabs on a stick)

**quadriplegic** (see [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#quadriplegic))

**Quakers** (an acceptable term for all references to the Society of Friends and its members)

**quandary**

**quarantine, self-quarantine** (hyphen) Refers to separating one or more people from the rest of a community, usually to try to stop the spread of a virus, infectious disease, etc. Quarantines can be ordered by authorities or self-imposed. Distinguish between **mandatory** and **voluntary** isolation whenever the detail is not obvious from context. Although the word quarantine literally means "40 days" in Italian, specific duration varies widely, depending on circumstances (e.g., a **10-day quarantine**, a **two-week quarantine**). It's **OK to use quarantine and isolation interchangeably** in most news stories (e.g., **self-isolation**). Be aware that some health authorities reserve "isolation" for confirmed cases of infection and "quarantine" for possible or suspected cases. These narrower definitions are debatable. Furthermore, such contested nuance is lost on most of our audience given widespread generic use of the words as synonyms. However, if officials in a given jurisdiction are stressing a distinction, and if the detail is relevant to given coverage (e.g., it helps put a given quote into context), then it's a good idea to point this out in a story whenever practical. We always distinguish between indisputably factual differences in medical stories (e.g., diagnosis vs. prognosis, and virus vs. bacteria). But when vernacular is less clearcut, we take into account entrenched, generic meanings of words to avoid confusing our audience (e.g., we do not restrict the words "mania" or "phobia" to narrowly defined clinical definitions). See [health reporting](/home/h/health_reporting#accuracy) for details and related principles.

**quarterfinal** (hyphen dropped to match **semifinal**)

****quarter-horse*

*quartet*

*quarto, quartos****

**quaver, quavering** (a sound, especially a voice, that vibrates or trembles)

**Quebec** (no accent in geographical name; abbreviated as **Que.**) Using "Que." instead of Quebec in web headlines is optional (See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities)); **Quebec City** (not Ville de Québec), but **Hydro-Québec**, etc. (See [French words in our English journalism](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for detailed guidelines)

**Quebec Bar** (instead of Barreau du Québec) Avoid adding "Association" to the translated proper noun (i.e., use Quebec Bar rather than "Quebec Bar Association"), based on entrenched usage. OK to use the bar, the organization, the association, etc., lowercase in second reference. See [French](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#bar) for details, other examples, and related guidelines.

**Québec Solidaire** (not _Québec solidaire_) The abbreviation **QS** is fine in second reference, even though this political party is not as well known as PQ or ADQ. See [French words and accents](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for relevant capitalization guidelines.

**Quebecer** (_not_ -cker)

**Québécois, [Parti Québécois](/home/p#PQ) (PQ), Bloc Québécois (the Bloc** preferred to **BQ)** See also [Party versus party](/home/p/party)

**Quebecor** (OK in first reference to **Quebecor Inc.**) The company adopted an accent in the French version of its name (Québecor) in 2012, but the English version remains without an accent. See [French](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for detailed guidelines on handling French words in our English journalism, including [names of organizations](/home/f/french-words-and-accents#namesoforganizations) (e.g., Hydro-Québec but Quebecor).

**Quebec provincial police** (lowercase, no abbreviation) See [Sûreté du Québec](/home/s#SQ) for guidelines on use of the French noun and the short form SQ, as well as [police forces](/home/p/police-forces).

**Queen** (of the U.K. and Canada); former British monarchs retain a capital "Q," as in **Queen Victoria** and the **former Queen**; use **queen** lowercase when referring to the monarchs of other countries, as in **former queen Astrid** of Belgium, unless the title appears before the name of the reigning queen (e.g., Queen Silvia of Sweden but the queen of Sweden). See [**royal titles**](/home/r/royal-titles) for detailed guidelines, including the difference between **Queen Consort** and Queen dowager, and why it's normally unnecessary to use roman numerals when referring to Elizabeth (i.e., **Queen Elizabeth** rather than Queen Elizabeth II).

**Queen Elizabeth 2** (ocean liner), **QE2**

**Queen Elizabeth Way** (the QEW, but avoid in national stories) A highway in southern Ontario named after the _Queen Mother_, not her daughter the Queen.

**Quebec lieutenant** (lowercase) This is a commonly used term applied to a federal cabinet minister from Quebec who advises the prime minister on matters involving that province. This person often runs the federal party's organization in Quebec as well.

**Queen Mother** (1900-2002) The widow of King George VI. Do not use her name, as in "Queen Mother Elizabeth," because of confusion with her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Instead, write "the Queen's mother" (possessive) or "the Queen Mother" (the Queen dowager's designation for about 50 years). The term **Queen Mum** is fine in second reference and headlines. (See also [**royal titles**](/home/r/royal-titles) for more details about the Queen dowager versus the Queen Consort)

****questionnaire****

**question period** (lowercase)

**queue** (a line of people) _Do not confuse with_ **cue** (a prompt or billiards stick)

****quiche Lorraine****

**quick** (adj. and adv.) The preferred adverb is **quickly**, but quick is also acceptable in some cases. As an adverb, quick is most commonly found in idiomatic expressions, such as "Get rich quick."

### Quirky capitalization

**eBay, iTunes and other** **quirky capitalization**

Most proper nouns begin with a capital letter (_Ford_). Some are made up of more than one word (_Canadian Broadcasting Corporation_). A few are fused (such as the old _SkyDome_, renamed the _Rogers Centre_ in February 2005).

**We generally adopt the original form of names**, including routine references to companies (_Microsoft_), computer software (_FrontPage_) and many other proper nouns ([_ChatGPT_](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#ChatGPT "C")), **unless (i) they're difficult to read** (_Kazaa_ not _KaZaA_), **(ii) are all lowercase or all uppercase** without being actual abbreviations (_Adidas_ not _adidas_, _Craigslist_ not _craigslist_, _Imax_ not _IMAX_, _Kiss_ not _KISS_, _Lego_ not _LEGO_, _Lululemon_ not _lululemon_, _Nabisco_ not _NABISCO_, _Nasdaq_ not _NASDAQ_, _Nike_ not _NIKE_, the PBS program _Nova_ not _NOVA_, _Scrabble_ not _SCRABBLE_, _Via_ not _VIA_, _Visa_ not _VISA_), **or (iii) use a jarring uppercase graphical treatment** of what normally would be lowercase lettering (_Athletes Can_ not _Athletes CAN_ and _Nav Canada_ not _NAV Canada_):


> **eBay** (but EBay at the start of a sentence)
> **ePub** as in an ePub file (but EPub at the start of a sentence)
> **iMac** (but IMac at the start of a sentence)
> **iPods** (but IPods at the start of a sentence)
> **iTunes** (but ITunes at the start of a sentence)
> **MuchMusic
> ****PowerPoint** (proprietary computer software)
> **Teleprompter** (not TelePrompTer)
> **WestJet
> ****WikiLeaks**


We avoid most all-lowercase names in published news stories. And while we normally restrict all-uppercase nouns to initialisms, such as CD-ROM, exceptions are made when there are compelling editorial reasons (e.g., the CIA code name **[MK-ULTRA](/home/m#MK-ULTRA)**).

**How to handle specific, unorthodox lettering sometimes boils down to individual judgment.** For example, the Calgary-based company **ReSourceYYC** is OK because it's reasonably close to modern, standard publishing norms (e.g., **ePub** and **HarperCollins**), and there's no point trying to muck around with a name that begins with an initial cap, and then includes a limited number of other initials caps later. By contrast, "EVOLVsolar" and "geoLOGIC" would we written as **EvolvSolar** and **GeoLogic** because the original versions are harder to read quickly — appearing more like typos than intended text. Bear in mind that companies, themselves, can be inconsistent in their own marketing (e.g., in 2019, "EVOLVsolar" graphics were commonly rendered as the equivalent of "EVOLVSOLAR," but with uppercase "SOLAR" in a smaller point size and a different colour).

For the purposes of our journalism, therefore, **it's OK to change typography slightly to make words clearer, to keep text consistent with CBC in-house style, etc.** This lets us put the interests of our audience first (e.g., to boost comprehension, to steer clear of "shouted" uppercase advertising, like "VISA" instead of Visa). It also allows us to retain editorial control (e.g., to censor anything potentially offensive, such as the F-word or other profanity embedded in proper nouns). **But when imposing something as basic as more standardized capitalization, we should always respect the spirit of the non-traditional lettering** (e.g., "EVOLVsolar" becomes "EvolvSolar" rather than "Evolvsolar" because the capital S helps the word "Solar" stand out — which is clearly intended, based on the company's use of colour, font size, etc., in its logos.

**If fiddling with an unorthodox combination of uppercase and lowercase characters makes a name harder to read** (e.g., _Outtv_) or the exact opposite of the original (e.g., _OutTV_), **then we generally leave the noun untouched** (e.g., _OUTtv_). Since companies can change their branding on a whim, altering what is and is not capitalized without notice or explanation, it's worth remembering that some of these nouns wind up having relatively short shelf lives (e.g., _ROBTv_ became _BNN_ within a few years, and the analytics company **_comScore_** switched to **_Comscore_**). 

Keep in mind that some forms used in generic constructions (e.g., [e-](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#email) as in _e-book_ and _e-health_) may be altered in proper nouns (e.g., **eHealth Ontario**, which has no hyphen.

**If a proper noun is identified as an abbreviation**, whether pronounceable as an [acronym](/home/a/acronyms) or not, **all-uppercase letters are fine** (e.g., the company _DAVE Wireless_ instead of _Dave Wireless_). But if the proper noun is not immediately thought of as an abbreviation, or has been conventionally treated as a word rather than as an abbreviation (e.g., the musical group _Abba_ instead of _ABBA_), only an initial capital letter is generally used. The best test is whether the name is spelled out at least once in a story:

> Data & Audio-Visual Enterprises Wireless (**DAVE**) calls its new cellular service Mobilicity.
>
> He hummed an **Abba** song while she steeped the tea. \[The musical group is not spelled out.\]


**Since we're writing words, not logos, we drop unorthodox or superfluous punctuation**, such as the **!** after _Bravo_ and Yahoo and _Mamma Mia_ (the musical), the \* in _\*NSYNC_ (which we write as '_N Sync_), and the asterisk at the end of _Walmart_. Note: For years, Walmart's official logo was all uppercase with a star in the middle (WAL\*MART). But most news organizations, including CBCNews.ca, used a hyphen and limited capitalization (_Wal-Mart_) instead. The company eventually adopted a fused form ([Walmart](/home/n/names-versus-logos#Walmart)).

In 2000, The Canadian Press ruled that virtually all proper nouns must begin with capital letters (so _eBay_ became _EBay_). But a few years later, it began writing _iTunes_ not _ITunes_ so the policy wasn't consistent. In 2005, CP added the entry "IPod not iPod" to its revised Caps and Spelling manual. We, however, continued to use iPod and eBay for the reasons outlined above. In mid-2008, CP revised its style to iPod and eBay as well.

CBC News agrees with the Washington Post and many other publications that are relatively relaxed about lowercase letters at the beginning of proper nouns, as long as a capital letter appears soon afterward. One of the Post's former senior editors, Bill Walsh, says it's no more jarring than writing _van Gogh_ or _de Gaulle_.

**Note: Sentences and headlines almost always start with a capital letter, even in the case of most quirky nouns that are lowercase**, such as eBay or k.d. lang — which should be posted as **EBay** and **K.d. lang** at the start of sentences (or as **Lang** alone, if it's a second reference).

**Overview**
**Do not invisibly clean up people's quotes on the web by changing syntax, grammar or words, with the exception of removing ums, ehs and other disfluencies** defined under "verbatim" below.

**Use square brackets \[ \] when inserting your own words in quotes to clarify something for readers.** (Examples appear below. See also [brackets](/handy-links/punctuation/brackets) for separate, detailed guidelines.)

**Use an ellipsis (...) to indicate that words have been removed from the middle of a statement, but not from its beginning or end.** (Examples appear below. See also [ellipses](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses) for separate, detailed guidelines.)

**When chopping words or phrases, never change the meaning of someone's statement** — e.g., avoid distorting "We will probably vote yes" into "We will ... vote yes."


**Verbatim defined**
**Quotation marks indicate that the exact words were spoken or written.

We quote people verbatim, undetectably removing only two types of distracting speech disfluencies** (i.e., cutting them without alerting our website's readers):
**
1\. False starts** (e.g., "ru-re-regardless," which we would transcribe as "regardless").

**2\. Sounds that fill pauses but aren't normally considered words** (e.g., eh, um, er).

**Exception No. 2 has limits.** While it's OK to cut "ah," it's not acceptable to delete "like" or "I mean" or other conversational padding without alerting the reader. So "the inter, intura, I mean intranet" would be transcribed as "the ... intranet."
**Do not _invisibly_ fix bad syntax, poor grammar, etc.** Instead, leave the wording as is, flag the edit or choose a different quote. There are no exceptions.


**Accuracy and transparency**
**Clearer and tougher rules about transcribed speech were introduced at CBCNews.ca in the spring of 2006.** These are stricter than guidelines found in the Canadian Press and Globe and Mail manuals, which give writers and editors vague discretion when "fixing" quotes.

**Under CBCNews.ca's system, the people we quote are treated more consistently.** Our journalists no longer have to waste time debating whether to polish the comments of one person, such as a premier or prime minister, while ignoring the subject-verb disagreement of another.

Some news organizations, such as the New York Times, have had similar policies for years. And a few others, such as the Washington Post, have also recently adopted stricter guidelines on quotes —abandoning the practice of letting writers and editors quietly fix wording between inverted commas.

**Transcribing virtually verbatim quotes increases our website's accuracy.** Since we're a broadcasting corporation, readers are often given the option to click on various audio and video reports, and CBC.ca's wording should match what was said. (Removing disfluencies, such as um, is a publishing convention that helps the reader without requiring judgment calls about fixing grammar or changing diction.)

**The new rules also make our journalism more transparent by clearly disclosing edits** (i.e., ellipses show that words are missing while square brackets indicate that words have been added by our journalists).



**EXAMPLES**

**Fairly and accurately abridging**

Original:

> "My government will act. We're not, uh, going to, to, we're not going to wait another day."


Correct and smooth edit:

> "My government will act," Harper said. "We're not going to wait another day."


Correct but less smooth edit (with ellipsis flush to period, indicating a full stop):

> "My government will act.... We're not going to wait another day," Harper said.


Technically OK but poorer edit because the ellipsis is in an unnatural spot:

> "My government will act. We're not ... going to wait another day."

**Clarifying a word's meaning**
Original:

> "Nobody told us about the, um, dangers. They assured us everything was OK."


Correct edit, removing "um" and clarifying the identity of "they":

> "Nobody told us about the dangers. They \[gondola workers\] assured us everything was OK."

**Fixing grammatical errors**
**If a glaring grammatical blunder is in a quote**, and you've decided you need to use this part of the quote in a story (i.e., you can't shorten the wording or paraphrase), **and if for editorial reasons you've chosen to fix the gaffe, then flag the edit with square brackets.**

Original (the last lines of one of Jean Chrétien's final speeches as prime minister):

> "My friend, I believe in Canada. And it's why I say to yous tonight: _Au revoir, et vive le Canada_ !"


Correct but poor because the edits are distracting:

> "My friend\[s\], I believe in Canada. And it's why I say to \[you\] tonight: _Au revoir, et vive le Canada_ !"


Another less-than-ideal option:

> "I believe in Canada. And it's why I say to \[you\] tonight: _Au revoir, et vive le Canada_ !"


Better choice, if long quote is used:

"I believe in Canada. And it's why I say ... _Au revoir, et vive le Canada_ !"

Best choice:

"I believe in Canada,” Chrétien said as he ended his final speech to the Liberal Party with his trademark rallying cry: "_Vive le Canada_ !"

**The last version is superior because it's accurate, it flows smoothly** (without distracting grammatical revisions) **and it provides our readers with context by pointing out that his final words were very familiar ones.**

(See also [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words) for detailed guidelines on using accents and italics.)

**Retaining grammatical errors**
**Avoid the instinctive rush to impose rigorous written grammar on natural, spoken English. Doing so can easily ruin quotes.**

For example, do not "clean up" a plural pronoun that should technically be singular as long as the speaker's meaning is clear.

Original (OK to publish):

> "That company poisoned our water. They made people sick. They should pay."


Poor and unnecessarily pedantic edit:

> "That company poisoned our water. \[It\] made people sick. \[It\] should pay."


**Even in the case of subject-verb disagreements, the original quote can be used if it's deemed an asset to the story.**

Original left intact:

> "We makes the money, we should keeps it too," Johnson said.


Poor edit:

> "We \[make\] the money, we should \[keep\] it too," Johnson said.


Fixing the above errors with square brackets would be unsatisfactory because of the number of visible edits in such a short statement.

Keep in mind that the words you're tempted to change have probably already been broadcast on radio or TV. **If you're uncomfortable posting a grammatical construction because you think it makes the speaker seem inarticulate or unintelligent, consider either picking a different quote or paraphrasing.**


**English as a second language**
**When transcribing a quote from someone who barely speaks English**, such as the refugee claimant facing deportation below, there's no point trying to rewrite the entire statement with a series of square brackets. Instead, **paraphrase**.

Original, too confusing to publish:

> "They says they's going to, um, deporting me and me's family. We can'ts go there. Need help. Danger. Not go back. No hopes. Um. Very sad."


Paraphrase:

Pleading to stay in Canada, Woo said his family would be in danger if deported.

**Brief quotes** such as "very sad" **can be blended in as long as the wording is accurate and the addition benefits the reader.** But posting too many partial quotes in one story can make the piece seem either fragmented or incomplete.

See also [long, medium and short](/home/q/quotes-overview#length) in the overview on quotes for a more detailed discussion about length, including fragments.


**Capital letter latitude, as in 'We' not '\[W\]e'**
**Capital letters can be added to the beginning of quotes, and punctuation can be changed at the end, according to long-standing publishing convention.** This practical approach keeps unwanted square brackets and ellipses from cluttering up stories, since people often say things before and after the words we've decided to report.

Original end of a famous speech delivered by Winston Churchill in 1940:

> "We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender; and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it, were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the Old."


One of many correct and acceptable excerpts used in news coverage:

> "We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender."


Another correct option:

> "We shall never surrender."


Wrong (unnecessary ellipses):

> "... We shall never surrender...."


Wrong (unnecessary capital letter in square bracket):

> "\[W\]e shall never surrender."


**Attribution instead of an ellipsis**
**Inserting attribution sufficiently flags the end of a quote for readers, according to a well-established convention.** Adding an ellipsis to highlight that a quote does not continue directly into the next sentence or paragraph is considered superfluous.

Wrong (unnecessary ellipsis):

> "Like Toronto, we're discovering money — money at all cost. We have to stop thinking about money and start thinking about our well-being...," Tremblay said.
>
> "Of course, it's easy for me to say that since I'm a multimillionaire," he added with a laugh.


Correct:

> "Like Toronto, we're discovering money — money at all cost. We have to stop thinking about money and start thinking about our well-being," Tremblay said.
>
> "Of course, it's easy for me to say that since I'm a multimillionaire," he added with a laugh.


This approach is followed by many news organizations, including The Canadian Press and CBC.ca. **We embrace the idea that inverted commas reflect the words spoken or written between that punctuation. But we reject arguments that attribution itself is not a substitute for an ellipsis.**

Once a quote is closed, all bets are off. We make no promise to our readers that a subsequent open quote represents an immediate continuation of the previous statement. It may or it may not, just as the original quote may or may not have started with the first words of a self-contained sentence.

**The identity of speakers should always be placed high in quotes** (generally within the first 30-40 words) to help our readers. See also the [overview on quotes](/home/q/quotes-overview) for a brief discussion of when attribution is unnecessary.


**Handling paragraph breaks**
When a long quote is split into two paragraphs, the closing inverted commas are left off the end of the first paragraph to indicate that the same person is speaking in the next one.

As previously mentioned, ellipses are not used at the opening or closing of quotes.

This means that **you retain an ellipsis at the end of a paragraph if, and ONLY IF, this paragraph break happens to coincide with an edit** (i.e., you've chosen to remove words from a quote in the exact same spot where you've decided to extend the quote into a second paragraph).

Original Stephen Leacock quote from 1912:

> "Many of my friends are under the impression that I write these humorous nothings in idle moments when the wearied brain is unable to perform the serious labours of the economist. My own experience is exactly the other way. The writing of solid, instructive stuff fortified by facts and figures is easy enough. There is no trouble in writing a scientific treatise on the folklore of Central China, or a statistical enquiry into the declining population of Prince Edward Island. But to write something out of one’s own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between. Personally, I would sooner have written 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica."


Correct quote 1 (featuring an ellipsis that coincides with a paragraph break):

> "Many of my friends are under the impression that I write these humorous nothings in idle moments when the wearied brain is unable to perform the serious labours of the economist," Leacock wrote in 1912.

> "My own experience is exactly the other way. The writing of solid, instructive stuff fortified by facts and figures is easy enough....
>
> "But to write something out of one’s own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between. Personally, I would sooner have written 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica."


**In reality, such an ellipsis is still in the middle of the quote. It simply happens to fall at the start of a paragraph break.**

Other options include splitting the paragraph in a different spot or closing the first part of the quote with attribution:

Correct quote 2 (with ellipsis falling inside a paragraph):

> "Many of my friends are under the impression that I write these humorous nothings in idle moments when the wearied brain is unable to perform the serious labours of the economist. My own experience is exactly the other way," Leacock wrote in 1912.
>
> "The writing of solid, instructive stuff fortified by facts and figures is easy enough.... But to write something out of one’s own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between.
>
> "Personally, I would sooner have written 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica."


Correct quote 3 (shorter, and with attribution replacing ellipsis):

> "The writing of solid, instructive stuff fortified by facts and figures is easy enough," Leacock wrote in 1912. 
>
> "But to write something out of one’s own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between.
>
> "Personally, I would sooner have written 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica."


For more detailed typography and punctuation guidelines, see [ellipses](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses) as well as [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks). The ellipses entry includes a famous example of Pierre Trudeau talking about sex.


**Pronunciations (gonna, gotcha, etc.)**
**Prefer standard English when typing quotes, such "I'm going to see you later" instead of "I'm gonna see ya later."** Colloquialisms such as "gonna" are reserved for a dash of local dialect or colour in features, but should be used only if accurate and never to make someone look uneducated.

Some terms such as "gotcha" have become informal words in their own right. But they should be used only if they truly reflect what was said. There's a big difference between someone hurriedly saying "I got you that book," and someone else pausing, grinning and then distinctly uttering "gotcha."

**Always give speakers the benefit of the doubt when a word is slightly mispronounced, as long as the slip is obvious.**

For instance, type "nuclear" even if the person clearly said "new-cue-lurr" (with an extra vowel between the "c" and the "l"), and "government" even if the individual said "gov-er-mint" (dropping the "n" and changing the last vowel sound).

If we didn't follow this approach, we couldn't report sensibly. We'd be writing down sounds rather than words ("per-scrip-shun" instead of "prescription"), constantly arguing over whether a certain noun or verb or modifier has more than one acceptable pronunciation. And our readers would end up struggling through bizarre phonetic terrain rather than gliding smoothly down a well-travelled road of conventional spellings.

So just because some British speakers add an "r" to "Canada," and many other English speakers slip an extra "r" in "sherbet," and virtually all of us put an "r" in "colonel," doesn't mean we should when transcribing quotes.


**Instant replay**
**All writers and editors should carefully read direct quotes to ensure they make sense.** If something doesn't look right, there's a very good chance the comments have been transcribed incorrectly.

**But never guess about the text inside inverted commas.** Never assume what the correct quote is.

The only way to be certain that a dubious quote is wrong is to **check it against the original audio.**

Note: All CBC.ca writers must take the time to transcribe quotes before submitting stories for publication. See [broadcast script warning](/home/q/quotes-editing#broadcast) below for more details.


**But that's what she meant**
**Be careful not to indiscernibly "fix" diction on the false grounds that this is what the speaker intended.** Replacing one word with another is not the same as applying standard spelling to an uncommon or twisted pronunciation.

If someone clearly says "perspective" and you're certain they meant "perceptive," do not simply change the wording.

Your options include picking a different quote, choosing a different "in" and "out" (i.e., avoiding the problematic part of the direct quote), deleting part of the quote with an ellipsis, paraphrasing rather than quoting, publishing the mistake as is and letting readers draw their own conclusions, or fixing the mistake in a transparent way with square brackets — as long as you're sure that the text you're inserting is correct.


**Avoid contestable 'corrections'**
**Do not change the wording of quotes simply to match a CBC.ca stylistic preference. While some rules of speech are indisputable**, such as a plural subject (e.g., "they") generally matching a plural verb (e.g., "are"), **others fall into a much greyer area.**

If, for example, someone says "none were hurt," do not change this to "none \[was\] hurt." For starters, many authorities embraced "none were" as equally acceptable years ago. Such edits also tend to distract readers and insult speakers.

For the same reason, if someone says "disinterested," do not replace this with "uninterested" in square brackets. Direct quotes are the wrong place to enforce certain CBC.ca preferences, such as the distinction between "not biased" and "not interested."

**Quotes feature someone else's words, and as long as their meaning is clear we respectfully publish and attribute debatable "errors" rather than imposing our copy editing voice on them.**


**Fix factual errors**
**If you realize that people have accidentally misspoken but haven't corrected themselves** (e.g., "he was acquitted in 1975" instead of "he was convicted in 1975"), **generally abandon the quote and paraphrase instead**. In rare cases, when the direct quote is essential to the piece, the correct detail should be presented in a way that's least likely to confuse readers and disrupt the story's flow. This usually means publishing square brackets in place of the false information.

**Only in exceptional instances should the original mistake be published as is, with a correction delayed until the sentence immediately after the direct quote.** This type of postponed correction must be justified for editorial reasons, such as in a story about a person accused of inventing historical facts or making other sweeping statements that we've determined aren't true.

**Never use the term "_sic_" in daily journalism to highlight an error in speech. It carries a condescending tone. Either pick a different quote, leave the error as is and let readers draw their own conclusions, or remove the mistake and replace it with correct wording in square brackets.** The word _sic_ (Latin for "thus" or "so") is appropriate only in rare cases — e.g., when posting long written excerpts in features, to let readers know that we have transcribed a published error intentionally.


**Revise certain spelling in quotes**
As with many media organizations, including the New York Times, **we generally change generic spellings to conform to our own style**.

So we would write "centre" not "center," even if the U.S. president has read the word from a prepared text, and we would write "tire" not "tyre," even if a British court's transcript assigned a "y" to a witness's testimony.

In the case of proper nouns, however, we follow the preferences of individual organizations, such as the National Arts Centre in Ottawa versus the Kennedy Center in Washington. (See [spelling](/home/s/spelling) and [defence, labour, centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for more detailed guidelines)


**Symbols as words**
**Usually punctuation marks and other special characters are spelled out as words** in quotes:


> "That's it. Period."
>
> "What the blank blank are you talking about?"
>
> "We dropped our lawsuit after the company tacked a couple of zeros onto the settlement."


**The test is whether the spelled-out version not only reflects what was said but also helps our audience understand the meaning**. For example, by using the word "period" instead of just the symbol for closing punctuation above, the quote's intended stress is captured. And by writing out "blank blank" instead of adding dashes ( — — ) or other special characters that represent spaces, we avoid ambiguity (i.e., the unintended suggestion that parts of the quote have been censored).

**The most common exceptions are units that specify quantity** ($ for dollar) or **other forms of measurement** (C for Celsius):


> "They're expected to report a loss of $5.5 million."
>
> "The back of the bus felt like it was 40 C."


**Other exceptions are rare, and involve cases when words would needlessly hinder comprehension:**


> "We want customers to share all complaints/concerns."


Rendering a quote like this as "complaints slash concerns" serves no editorial purpose.


**Sometimes, people being quoted fail to repeat a crucial word that provides important context** (e.g., "million" or "dollar"). The **recommended practice is to render these quotes in the clearest but least-jarring manner.** This usually means adding a missing spoken word in square brackets but adding an implied symbol without square brackets:


> VERBATIM QUOTE: "I know that they have 50 to 60 million dollars."
>
> PUBLISHED QUOTE: "I know that they have $50 \[million\] to $60 million."
>
> VERBATIM QUOTE: "I know that they have 50 million to 60 million dollars."
>
> PUBLISHED QUOTE: "I know that they have $50 million to $60 million."


**Verbatim renderings**
**Brief excerpts from published material, such as a book, can also be altered to match our spelling style if inserted in our daily journalism. But longer excerpts posted on their own** (e.g., an 800-word editorial from a U.S. newspaper reproduced as part of a CBCNews.ca feature, or a web page highlighting a series of excerpts lifted from court documents) **should be kept intact, with the original spelling, for ease of editing.** These should be treated as verbatim renderings, akin to offering our readers a PDF of the original document. Such text should be identified as unedited, with the source and context clearly marked.


**Transcripts versus prepared text**
Transcriptions are written versions of spoken words. When we transcribe audio clips we're providing readers with brief transcripts inside inverted commas.

**When external sources provide transcripts, clearly identify the words as such** (e.g., "according to a transcript of the trial provided by the Court of King's Bench in Saskatchewan").
**
Always distinguish between actual transcripts and the published text of speeches provided to us before delivery. Name the source unless it's already clear from the context** (e.g., "The risk is obvious, but the danger of doing nothing is even higher," the defence minister said in prepared text released just before his speech).

**Whenever possible, text released ahead of time should be checked against actual delivery. Our reference to "prepared text" can be dropped only if the words spoken have been confirmed.**

Normally, there is no value in noting minor discrepancies between prepared and delivered versions, and we simply publish what was actually spoken. Occasionally, however, something that's been changed at the last minute can be newsworthy. So **be alert when comparing versions, wearing a journalist's hat rather than a transcriber's.**

Embargoed content, of course, must never be posted until the time specified in whatever agreement has been worked out.

For practical guidelines on handling lengthy excerpts from court transcripts, etc., published on their own, see [verbatim renderings](/home/q/quotes-editing#renderings) above.


**Excerpts from user-generated content, emails, social media, etc.**
**When quoting content from people's emails, blogs**, Facebook pages or other social media accounts, comments at the bottom of stories, **etc., in our journalism, follow our general approach to editing outlined above.
**
NOTE: Standalone user-generated content clearly branded as such (e.g., a thread of comments at the bottom of a web article) is normally published unedited. In the case of UGC, these guidelines apply only to excerpts inserted directly in CBC stories.

To make external text added to our journalism easier for our audience to read, **fix spelling mistakes but then flag the changes with square brackets** to maintain our principle of transparency:

Original:

> "More than 200 means where doing good," she replied in a tweet.


Edited version for a CBCNews.ca story:

> "More than 200 means \[we're\] doing good," she replied in a tweet.


Notice that the grammar ("good" instead of "well") has not been changed, as outlined in the previous section on [avoiding contestable corrections](/home/q/quotes-editing#corrections).

**Small changes in punctuation, capitalization, numerical style, etc., can usually be made without the need to highlight the edit**, including when we remove gratuitous speech sounds ("waaay" for way). This matches the spirit of the sections on [revising certain spellings](/home/q/quotes-editing#spelling) in quotes and [pronunciations](/home/q/quotes-editing#gonna) above.

Original:

> "I don't mind a fine...... but 7500"


Edited version for a CBCNews.ca story:

> "I don't mind a fine. But $7,500?"


Original:

> "9 hours is waaay tooooo long."


Acceptable edit for a CBCNews.ca story that retains drawn-out vowel sounds:

> "Nine hours is waaay tooooo long."


Preferred edit for a CBCNews.ca story because it's clearest and easiest to scan:

> "Nine hours is way too long."


**Do not retain unorthodox uppercase or lowercase lettering.**

Original:

> "i too, am UNABLE to get tickets .... Some people are even selling them on Ebay for 108.00 !"


Edited version for a CBCNews.ca story:

> Ottawa resident Cathy Wong wrote: "I, too, am unable to get tickets. Some people are even selling them on eBay for $108!"

**Generally avoid repeating emoticons** (e.g., smiley faces) **or other special characters in news copy, except in rare cases when deleting the symbols removes essential context/meaning** (e.g., sarcasm).

Original:

> "What a shame it ended this way. :( The country treated her like dirt."


Edited version for a CBCNews.ca story (superfluous emoticon removed):

> "What a shame it ended this way. The country treated her like dirt."


Original:

> "He's beyond a doubt the BEST prime minister we've ever had. :-p "


Edited version (emoticon retained to convey key meaning):

> "He's beyond a doubt the best prime minister we've ever had. :-p "


CAUTION: Emoticons can be distracting as well as confusing (e.g., "QQ" might be two eyes shedding tears to some and a weird typo to others). Retain symbols as a last resort. If a mediocre comment hinges on a wink ;-), a dunce's cap <|:-/ or some other combination of dots, lines and curves, generally look for a different quote. Our bar is set high (i.e., usually only stellar remarks keep their emoticons because the price of unorthodox typography in these cases is worth the editorial value of the accompanying words).
**
[Use full names in attribution](/home/q/quotes-editing#attribution) whenever known** (e.g., a remark taken from someone's Facebook page or other social media account). **If actual authorship has not been confirmed and there's doubt about who wrote a remark, report only what is known** (e.g., where a comment appeared rather than assumptions about who composed it). **In some cases, it's impossible to verify authorship. If such quotes pass editorial muster, it's stylistically OK to use lowercase letters and special characters when citing people's web identities** (hans345 or @smartalec). But we must make it clear where the material is lifted from (e.g., from a particular website, in a thread of comments at the bottom of a CBCNews.ca story, in an email to the newsroom). Depending on circumstances, repeating a pseudonym or vague account name might help our audience find more content by the individual. A phrase such as "one person wrote," however, is sometimes sufficient — along the lines of brief clips in a string of "streeters" in a radio piece.

IMPORTANT: When handling any vague attribution, adhere to all relevant CBC journalistic policies about unnamed sources.

**Follow our normal approach to abbreviations in web journalism. If the shorthand is widely known, it does not need to be spelled out** (e.g., ASAP rather than "as soon as possible" and FYI rather than "for your information"). If it's comparatively obscure (e.g., the text message term LOL for "laughing out loud" was initially assumed to mean "lots of love" by some people), it should be defined in square brackets. The dictionary is a good guide. See [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language#abbreviationsandeuphemisms) for guidelines on terms such as WTF.

**Make sure the tweet, email excerpt, etc., adds value to the story.** As outlined in the [overview on quotes](/home/q/quotes-overview), it's sometimes better to paraphrase or to post only part of a verbatim comment.


**Broadcast script warning**
**Do not rely on radio and television scripts when posting quotes. They're not written to be read by the eye.** When the material is put on the air, the "quotes" are replaced by taped voices. We have to treat quotation marks differently because of the medium we work in.

**Always listen to the broadcast items to verify the words spoken. Even a small discrepancy can make a big difference to a story's meaning and to CBC.ca's credibility.**

Take our coverage of a blackout in downtown Vancouver in January 2001. We wrote:

> "It was a switch and it caused other stations along the system to fail," said B.C. Hydro spokesperson Wayne Cousins.


But it turns out this "quote" was lifted from a broadcast script, and that the radio reporter had merely paraphrased what was on the tape. Cousins actually said:

> "This was a switch, and this caused other substations along the system, specifically in the downtown core, to shut down."


Not only were several words changed (e.g., "this" and "substations") and deleted ("specifically in the downtown core"), but key language was revised at the end — "shut down" wrongly became "fail," which carries a different meaning. The other stations didn't actually fail. They merely shut down as expected.

People notice when CBC.ca quotes don't match the audio in radio or television reports. In this case, one B.C. reader emailed a complaint to our national newsroom: "If the other stations failed instead of shutting down, then this system would not have worked correctly."

**When reading quotes in broadcast scripts, of course, don't automatically assume they're wrong. Verification is the key.** Take the case of "gig" versus "jig."

On June 5, 2001, MP Deborah Grey was asked about the future of her party's leader, Stockwell Day. Here's what she told reporters outside the House of Commons:

> "I think he has to make some pretty serious decisions right now. And I think, fairly simply, the gig is up."


Radio and TV scripts correctly featured the word "gig," as in an engagement. But a web writer looking at the scripts changed the "g" to a "j" to match the cliché about a scheme being foiled ("the jig is up"). He even checked the Canadian Oxford to be sure. But he should have checked the tape.

Someone who heard the MP's clip on the air sent an email challenging our erroneous edit, which by this time was already featured in a headline. We fixed the mistake.

**CBC.ca journalists must take the time to transcribe all clips taken from original radio and television reports before posting these words on the web.** Broadcast journalists use inverted commas much more loosely than we do. Their scripts often contain only rough approximations of clips rather than verbatim renderings. **Until the audio has been checked, either postpone posting quotes or turn the typed versions provided by radio and television journalists into paraphrases.**


**Ethical, undistorted editing**
**CBC Journalistic Standards and Practices guidelines apply to internet and broadcast material.** Therefore, any changes permitted by CBCNews.ca's strict policy on transcribing quotes (outlined above) must also meet conditions laid out in the corporation's general policies on [editing interviews](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Finterviews-entrevues-1.4523175&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3g4ewwTurcEkcNR3NdAsHB).

**In brief, quotes must not be distorted through editing.** For example: "It's a really great example of bad government policy" must never become "It's a really great ... government policy." This would be unethical and violate CBC journalistic standards.

Another example: "We will probably, although we're not sure yet, and still have to discuss it further, lower taxes" could be shortened to "We will probably ... lower taxes." But it must never be twisted into "We will ... lower taxes."

Much of CBCNews.ca's original material comes from broadcasts reports. In the case of radio in particular, it's often impossible to tell if journalists have already manipulated the audio tracks by cutting chunks from the middle of a quote.

**If you think that a condensed version has been used in a broadcast item, try to find an original, unedited version to determine whether an ellipsis is needed.** Audio tracks are sometimes recorded at an encoding station during a live event, such as news conferences and speeches. **If it's not possible to check original recordings, treat the quotes in broadcast reports as unaltered** — i.e., never insert an assumed ellipsis unless you've confirmed that words have been chopped.
**
On the web, quotes can always be responsibly shortened with the use of punctuation** (...) to make them clearer, to remove profanity, etc., as long as the original meaning is not changed.

**But quotes should not be covertly revised for any reason other than those listed above** (i.e., to remove ehs, ums and other disfluencies). **When in doubt about changing a quote, check with a senior CBC.ca journalist.**

### Quotes overview

**Quotes (an overview)**










**Summary**
**Web stories without quotes can be as deficient as radio or television reports without clips.** Rather than hearing directly from the people and organizations we cover, readers are given only our summaries of what was said or written.

**But when picking and placing quotes, editorial judgment is required.** Always keep the following in mind:

-   **Good quotes in the right spots elevate our journalism**, providing everything from vivid detail or key context to improved story flow.
-   **Not all quotes are worth publishing.**
-   **Even when quotes are reasonably good, jamming too many into one story can cause more harm than good —** leaving readers with unnecessarily long and dense text they may well decide to abandon.
-   **Quotes are not paraphrases.** Inverted commas indicate that the words were spoken or written by someone else. **Do not use this punctuation unless you're satisfied the text is accurate** (i.e., you've verified the typed version against the original audio or have taken the quote from a trustworthy publishing source).

**This page features general tips on attribution, adding quotes to web journalism** (e.g., what's worth transcribing versus what should be paraphrased), **the length of quotes, etc.**

**See a separate entry on [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing) for strict rules governing the removal or revision of words inside inverted commas** — including guidelines on what to do about factual and grammatical errors.


**Skip dull stuff**
Colourful, emotional or poetic quotes add life to stories. But **if someone is merely rattling off facts or presenting dense information in a confusing way, paraphrase instead.**

**
Avoid quotes like this**

> "All bills introduced before the 1934 legislative session required that a second typewritten copy be sent to the archives. These were placed in boxes, brown boxes I believe, and when theses boxes became full a civil servant sealed them with masking tape. "

**Paraphrasing is sufficient**

> Until 1934, the province kept duplicate copies of bills at the legislature's archives.


As journalists with electronic word-processing equipment, we can condense and clarify such straightforward statements easily and accurately. We must, of course, remain true to a dull quote's original meaning. But we have more time to craft sentences than people speaking off the top of their heads.

By chopping here and revising there, we can frequently come up with a paraphrase that's shorter and easier for our readers to scan.


**Don't overuse quotes**
**Just because someone said something doesn't automatically mean it's worth transcribing and publishing.** This is particularly important to remember when we're offered a feast of comments from an informal scrum, a formal news conference, etc.
**Instead of providing what amounts to a transcript, be selective.** Pick a few good quotes and weave these into your copy.

In daily journalism, few remarks are as pithy or witty as bon mots from Oscar Wilde or Groucho Marx. But good quotes are still all around us. H**umour, imagery, unexpected turns of phrase and so forth can add a welcome dash of spice to otherwise relatively bland topics.**


**Words that grab our attention**

> "I do not think I have ever been accused of seducing anyone, even my wife," Harper quipped before pausing to look up in the public gallery, where his spouse nodded.
>
> > (From a story on Stephen Harper's first Question Period as prime minister in April 2006. Harper was responding to an accusation by the NDP that he had "seduced" former Liberal MP David Emerson to cross the floor and join his cabinet right after the election.)
>
> "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons," U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice told CNN. "But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."
>
> > (From a 2002 story about Washington's push to topple Saddam Hussein's regime. Note: The pronoun "he" in the first sentence does not require clarification — i.e., followed by the name \[Saddam\] in square brackets — because the word's meaning is obvious based on the story's context.)


**Criteria for picking quotes**
**In general, look for strong or vibrant words that:**

-   Concisely convey emotion.
-   Neatly summarize opinion.

Ideally, the language itself is also engaging — e.g., picturesque, poignant, etc. — although this is not essential.

**Consider the following examples of effective and relatively ineffective remarks, all taken from a single story** about four RCMP officers killed during a raid on a farm in Alberta in March 2005:


**Poor quote**

> Asked if the victims had been ambushed, RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Wayne Oakes said, "I don't know."


A simple paraphrase would get to the point sooner. Also, general attribution (the RCMP) rather than the name of a specific Mountie is sufficient in this case.


**Borderline quote**

> "It's my sad duty to inform you that four members of the RCMP were killed today in the line of duty – four brave, young members," said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Bill Sweeney.


The above sentence mainly conveys factual information. But the emotion ("sad duty") and description of the officers ("brave, young") makes it worth including if no other more compelling words were spoken.


**Fairly good quote**

> "You'd have to go back to 1885, to the Northwest Rebellion, to have a loss of this magnitude. It's devastating," said Sweeney.


We could report the 1885 historical context in a paraphrase. But leaving it in a brief quote that also includes emotion ("It's devastating") is an effective way to convey such information.


**Memorable quote**

"He's not my son, he's a wicked devil," said the suspect's father, Bill Roszko.

Comments such as "wicked devil" leap off the page. Our readers are told a great deal in just a few words.

**In some cases, even relatively pedestrian quotes can be effectively used to:**

-   Record key wording and nuances in statements.
-   Attribute potentially controversial remarks.
-   Support third-person statements that a story is built on (especially paraphrases in headlines and leads).
-   Reveal personal characteristics about a speaker or writer.

**Whether catchy or boring, other people's words should never be added to stories just for the sake of doing so. There should be a reason for including every quote.** In some cases, this may boil down to a writer or editor trying to improve the story's pacing — which is justified as long as the quote actually does this.


**Short, medium and long**
**Quotes do not have ideal lengths, although extremely long ones can hurt a story's flow and too many really short ones can leave readers feeling short-changed.**

When deciding where to place the inverted commas, keep a few things in mind:

-   Is the entire comment compelling, or is there an earlier and equally natural ending?
-   Is it easier for the reader if the quote is split into two paragraphs?

Brevity is not always a virtue. Be sure to provide readers with context if something inside inverted commas in unclear or could be misunderstood.

**In broadcast journalism, brief bursts of audio are sometimes used to help propel the radio or television piece along. But the web is a different medium**, and quotes should be based on the eye's needs not what a broadcaster feels suits the ear.

Partial quotes incorporated into the main body of a story can be effective if used sparingly and for a reason (e.g., to lift a brief, colourful phrase from a long, confusing or otherwise unusable quote, or to attribute catchy but controversial wording). But **extremely short excerpts are often unnecessary and distracting, especially when the language is generic.**

**Acceptable fragments**

> Existing copyright law is "arcane and insane," she said. 
>
> They're part of an "axis of evil," Bush said, and must be confronted by the rest of the world.


**Pointless fragments**

> Canada must "move quickly" to tighten border security, she said. 
>
> Police will "probably" call off the search Thursday, he said.

**He says repetition is tiresome. 'Avoid repetition,' he warned.**
**Setting up a quote can help move a story forward** (e.g., introducing the speaker's identity, outlining a country's position in an international dispute, etc.)

**But paraphrasing what is about to be said** (before a quote) **or what's just been said** (after a quote) **is redundant**.


**Fine**

> France and Russia are both opposed to the resolution, but it's not clear if either will use its veto at the United Nations Security Council.

> "The time for a vote will come, but that's a long way off," said the UN secretary general. "We must concentrate on fruitful dialogue and diplomacy, not on division and demagoguery."

**Redundant**

> France and Russia are both opposed to the resolution, but it's not clear if either will use its veto at the United Nations Security Council.
>
> The UN secretary general says all countries should focus on dialogue and diplomacy.
>
> "The time for a vote will come, but that's a long way off," he said. "We must concentrate on fruitful dialogue and diplomacy, not on division and demagoguery."


**In this case, either leave out the quote or the paraphrase. Since the quote adds a bit of zest to the story, the paraphrase should be dumped.**


**Attribution**
**We normally attribute quotes. There are three exceptions:**

-   **Brief remarks that amount to "sound bites" taken from broadcast scripts** (e.g., _"This is crazy!" shouted one protester as the police moved forward_). In these cases, we rarely know the identity of the speaker. Such quotes are acceptable in moderation as long as they actually improve an article by adding colour or useful detail.
-   **The online equivalent of brief audio mentioned above, such as a tweet** or other microblogging post (e.g., _"This proves that new governments don't mind using old tactics," wrote one person from P.E.I. Of the more than 500 comments posted on CBCNews.ca within two hours of the announcement, 95 per cent were critical of the PM's decision_).
-   **Key quotes from confidential sources in scoops, investigative reports, etc.** In these rare cases, senior journalists must have already ruled that the unnamed sources are essential to the story, as outlined in existing CBC News editorial policy. See the Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on [Protection of Sources](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fsources-sources-1.4523572&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0BNv0y2uDfyvcFk1vXAgQ7) for more details about criteria governing the use of confidential and anonymous material. (NOTE: "Confidential" refers to known but unnamed sources. "Anonymous" refers to sources that are unknown, even to the CBC. Use of anonymous sources is exceedingly rare and requires special approval from news management, in accordance with our JSP policy.)

**In all other cases, readers should be left with no doubts about the source of a quote. Attribution must be clear** (e.g., a person's name and, when relevant, title or other helpful identifying information), **placed high in the quote** (i.e., generally no more than 30-40 words after the first inverted commas), **and inserted in a natural spot** (e.g., at the end of a phrase or complete thought if not a full sentence). **Context is important as well.** For example, we should let our readers know whether words were spoken from a witness box or in a scrum outside a courthouse, in Question Period or during a speech at a business luncheon.

**When comments are lifted from written statements, such as emails and news releases, the quotes should be identified as such** to make it clear to our audience that we have not transcribed an interview. See [transcripts versus prepared text](/home/q/quotes-editing#texts) for rules on publishing material taken from advance copies of speeches.

**In long quotes spread out over several paragraphs, attribution must appear in the first paragraph.** Sometimes, of course, the placement of attribution depends on how someone's statement has been shortened. See [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing) for examples of how attribution can be used instead of an ellipsis.


**Second reference names**
**We initially identify most people by their "full" (first and last) names in stories.** Two common exceptions: When the family name is already understood based on context (e.g., a spouse or child), or when an individual is widely known by a single name (e.g., Drake, Adele, Madonna) or [nickname](/home/n/nicknames).

Be aware that **in some cultures, family names are not actually "surnames"** (i.e., are not last in the sequence of names). For instance, the Chinese name Xi Jinping becomes Xi in second reference. (See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) for related guidelines.)

**There's no need for honorifics tied to gender or marital status** (Mrs., Ms. or Mr.) **before names in first or second reference** (e.g., Nawab rather than "Ms. Nawab"). **Avoid adding such honorifics to most titles, too**  (e.g., do NOT say or write "Mr. mayor" or "Madam premier" or "Mr. minister" **in first or second reference**). Even in on-air interviews, the title alone can normally suffice (e.g., "I'd like to clarify, premier, when you were told"). Optional exceptions are formal references to certain judicial figures, based on convention (e.g., Madam Justice Rosalie Abella"). See also [Dr.](/home/d/dr)

**In second reference, we normally refer to people by their family (usually last) name** (e.g., Jane Jones becomes Jones). **Exceptions are OK if a first name better suits the story** (e.g., to maintain a tone of informality), **or if a family name alone would cause confusion.** Sometimes, repeating a person's full name in second reference is necessary for clarity (e.g., when people sharing the same family name are mentioned). Always use a spouse's full name in first reference if the family name is different. [Particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) (de, du, van, von) can be a source of confusion. Convention and known personal preference are important factors when deciding whether to retain particles in second reference.

**Given names** (usually first names) **alone are particularly common when identifying people under 18 in second reference** (e.g., using Amanda instead of Todd in coverage of the death of 15-year-old Amanda Todd). **While we often follow this convention, there's no blanket rule** that applies to all young people. Exceptions include certain coverage of the arts and sports (e.g., using family names when referring to singers, film stars, athletes, etc., who happen to be under 18).


**Told CBC News**
**Avoid unnecessary self-promotion.** It's usually unwise to credit the CBC more than once in any given story, and very often no such attribution is required.

Most people reading our site assume that direct quotes have been obtained by the corporation's journalists. (We heard the speech; we participated in the scrum; we watched Question Period; we interviewed someone at their office or home.) So in routine stories there's no need to boast that "so and so told CBC News." Such tooting can be grating, CBC News has learned over the years.

**When credit is merited, generally use the catch-all attribution "CBC News"** rather than specifying individual platforms or services like CBC-TV, CBC Radio or CBCNews.ca for comments gathered by CBC News staff:

> "The verdict won't bring back my son, but I'm relieved the monster is being locked up for life," the victim's father told CBC News \[instead of _said in an interview on the CBC News Network_\].
>
> "The ban on beef from Brazil is stupid but not surprising," a former government scientist wrote in an email to CBC News \[instead of wrote _in an email sent to CBCNews.ca_\].


If a web story is based on an exclusive report from a specific program, however, we can make that clear when the story breaks as long as the credit is justified (i.e., no one else has the information) and it helps our readers better understand context:

> Ottawa plans to ground its new fleet of search-and-rescue helicopters, according to Defence Department documents obtained by CBC News: _The National_ Wednesday night.
>
> The catcher refused to comment, beyond saying that he first learned of the trade in a story posted Sunday on CBCSports.ca.
>
> "It's a matter of particles and waves, not magic wands. This is science, not Harry Potter," she said in an interview on CBC Radio's _Quirks & Quarks_.


(See also [CBC](/home/c/cbc) for guidelines on handling a range of CBC nouns)


**Prefer 'said' over 'say'
**One of the obvious differences between broadcast and online journalism is the possible lag between delivery and consumption of our stories — i.e., people may read our material long after it is posted.

**The print convention of using the past tense in direct attribution works well on the web** (e.g., _the premier said Monday, the court ruled Tuesday_). **This is the preferred style on CBCNews.ca.**

In breaking news, the present tense can sometimes be temporarily used. But these stories must be updated during a shift and should never be archived on our website in that form.

**_Indirect_ attribution** (paraphrases and partial quotes) **can be in the present tense, however, as long as no time element** (e.g., day of the week) **is included in the same sentence.** This is common in leads:

> A U.S. military lawyer prosecuting a Canadian teen at Guantanamo Bay says he's sickened by sympathetic portrayals of Omar Khadr, calling him an al-Qaeda "terrorist" who should spend the rest of his life in jail.
>
> At a news conference on Tuesday, chief prosecutor Col. Moe Davis made no attempt to hide his disdain for human rights activists who have rallied to defend Khadr, now 19.
>
> "It's really sometimes nauseating to read some of the things that have been written on how these terrorists are down here standing up for the Bill of Rights," Davis said a day before Khadr was to make his first appearance before a special military court at the U.S. naval base in Cuba.



(The start of a January 2006 story that meets CBCNews.ca style on "said" and "says")

**Avoid unnecessarily bouncing readers back and forth between tenses in the same story.** For instance, once a time element has been introduced (as in the second paragraph above), direct quotes should be kept in the past tense.


**Don't replace 'said' with inaccurate verbs**
The words "say" and "said" are common for a reason. They're short, neutral and natural. While people do say the darndest things, they don't necessarily _admit, concede, lament, maintain, opine_, etc.

You may want to write that someone _grumbled, shouted_ or _scoffed_ if you're certain they did. But **don't bother replacing "say" or "said" with supposed synonyms that, in reality, sacrifice accuracy, objectivity or just plain conversational style for the sake of variety. (**For details, see [say versus admit, claim, concede, etc.](/home/s/say))


**Check quotes carefully**
**The marks " " have special meaning.** They do not represent a paraphrase. **They highlight words that have been spoken or written.

If you haven't checked a quote that appears in a broadcast journalist's script, never use quotation marks.**

Do not presume that these were the words spoken. Such hastily typed "quotes" are almost never 100 per cent correct because TV and radio reporters are merely using them as guides (e.g., so that a producer or other person vetting the script has some sense of what the premier said, and so the reporter knows the "in" and "out" when editing the piece).

Broadcast scripts are not written to be read by the eye. When the material is put on the air, the "quotes" are replaced by actual spoken words. We have to treat quotation marks differently because of the medium we work in.

Understanding this is essential; the rule is worth repeating. **If the quote you're posting comes from either television or radio, you must transcribe the audio.** Do not rely solely on quick summaries of clips found in broadcast scripts.

**Even famous quotes should be verified by consulting a reliable source. Do not rely on your memory.** Shakespeare wrote about gilding gold not a lily; Milton said "Revenge at first though sweet, bitter ere long back on itself recoils" (not merely "Revenge is sweet"); and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never had Sherlock Holmes say "Elementary, my dear Watson." (For a longer discussion about common misquotes, see the Words: Woe & Wonder column [Quibbling over Quotes](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fmisquotes.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ZJ2mOE0AM8I09fmGLS73N).)


**Punctuation**
**Several typographical conventions must be followed when adding quotes to web journalism on CBC.ca.**

See [quotation marks](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks) for rules on punctuation inside inverted commas, single versus double quotation marks in headlines, handling slogans, expressing irony, etc.

See [ellipses](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses) for rules on chopping text from quotes.

See square [brackets](/handy-links/punctuation/brackets) for rules on adding text to quotes.

As mentioned at the top of this page, [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing) outlines strict limits on "cleaning up" words inside inverted commas.

**Radio Moscow** (_but_ Moscow radio)

**radioactive**

**raid** (n., v.) A common term for sudden or unexpected attacks by police, troops, etc. (e.g., a **drug raid**, a **military raid**). The word has other entrenched definitions, including a surprise assault "to commit a crime or to do harm," according to the Canadian Oxford. There is also acceptable figurative usage about plundering (e.g., a **kitchen raid** for snacks, a stock market **bear raid** involving price manipulation), as well as mischief-making (e.g., a **dorm raid** by students). There's often no confusion about the term's meaning (e.g., in a story about one **criminal gang's raid** on another gang's turf). CAUTION: **Be aware, however, that a noun or verb like "raid" can sometimes be misconstrued as tacit legitimization of one group's action against another.** Specifically, "raid" in a headline might wrongly suggest a sanctioned bust by authorities rather than an angry mob's violent, unlawful attack. It might also be perceived as downplaying the seriousness of a crime that endangered lives. **In such cases, always supply key context** (e.g., if people are accused of trespassing, making threats, damaging or destroying property). **To avoid ambiguity, consider clearer alternative wording** that fits the facts (e.g., nouns like attack or assault, and verbs like vandalize or ransack).

**railway** (preferred to railroad except in proper nouns) See [**railway** versus **railroad**](/home/r/railway-versus-railroad)

****railworker****

**raindrop, rainfall, rainforest, rainstorm** (see [**rain**](/home/w/weather-words#rain) for guidelines on millimetres versus centimetres)

**RAM** (random access memory)

**Rama Navami** (Hinduism) This festival celebrates the birth of Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu and the hero of the _Ramayana_, a Sanskrit epic of 24,000 stanzas. He is a popular religious figure and considered a supreme god by some Hindus. In news stories, **Rama** is fine in first reference. A dispute over a holy site in Rama's birthplace in Ayodhya, India, led to violence between Hindus and Muslims for many years. Hindus wanted to construct a **Rama temple** while Muslims wanted to rebuild a demolished mosque. For consistency, do not use alternative spellings ("Ram" or "Ram temple").

**Ramadan** (A holy time during the ninth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar) Ramadan is marked by special prayers, blessings, fasting, etc. **Eid al-Fitr**, often abbreviated to **Eid** in second reference, is a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. Dates of observance vary from year to year, depending on the moon and the country or region.

**ramp ceremony** (military term for solemn tribute to soldiers killed abroad as the caskets are loaded on transport planes and flown back to their home countries) Although this expression has become more widely known over the years, don't use it unless the context of the story makes the meaning immediately obvious. Otherwise, prefer clearer language, such as "farewell ceremony" or "departure ceremony." For example, a report on a Canadian soldier's body being loaded on a military plane at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan instantly conveys the meaning of "ramp ceremony." But a story with a totally different focus that only indirectly refers to "ramp ceremony" requires more explanatory language. Avoid the jargon "repatriation" of bodies, which sounds highly bureaucratic. (See [military terms](/home/m/military-terms-overview) for an overview of related language)

**rancour** _but_ **rancorous** (See [our and or](/home/s/spelling/our))

**Rand** (_not_ RAND) **Worldwide** (see [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

Rangoon (now called **Yangon**) The commercial centre and former capital city of Myanmar, also known as Burma. See [**Myanmar**](/home/m/Myanmar) for guidelines.

**ransom** (Avoid common redundancies, such as _"They demanded a $100,000 ransom for her release."_ Since ransom means a payment for someone's release, make it either: _"They demanded $100,000 for her release"_ or _"They demanded a $100,000 ransom."_)

**R&B** (rhythm and blues), **R&D** (research and development), **R&R** (rest and recreation) See also [ampersand](/home/a/ampersand)

**rape** (forced sexual intercourse) In Canada, there's no actual charge of _rape_. Instead, people are prosecuted for sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, etc. Although we can sometimes use the generic words "rape" in news stories, we should avoid any wording that suggests this is the actual Criminal Code charge. Since inappropriate kissing and forced sexual intercourse both fall under the broad heading of "sexual assault," putting certain charges into context with additional details can be highly useful to our audience. (See [**rape versus sexual assault**](/home/r/rape-versus-sexual-assault) for more details, as well as [serial rapist](/home/s#serialrapist))

**rapporteur** (lowercase, even before a name) "_The government appointed a special rapporteur_," and "_He confirmed that the review would be conducted by special rapporteur David Johnston, the former governor general_." (See [titles](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/titles/#occupations "Titles") for related capitalization guidelines)

**rapt** (from the word rapture) Fully absorbed or very intent, as in "rapt attention" (_not_ rapped or wrapped)

****rarefy, rarefied****

**rational** (sensible); **rationale** (statement of reasons)

**Ratzinger, Joseph** (became **Pope Benedict XVI** in 2005; retired as **pope emeritus** in 2013; died in 2022) See [Pope versus pope](/home/p/pope)

**raucous** (_not_ -cus)

**rave** (n.) type of music; a late-night and sometimes illicit dance party generally featuring loud, fast electronic music (The construction **rave party** is idiomatic and acceptable, especially since some people don't know that the word rave alone refers to an all-night bash. The plural is either **rave parties** or **raves**.)

****rayon****

**razzmatazz** (no hyphens)

**RBC** (see [banks](/home/b/banks) for guidelines)

**re-rh**
**re (as a prefix)**
**As a prefix, "re" is not normally followed by a hyphen unless (1) it's next to another "e" or (2) it could be confused with another word:** readmit, reapply, reassess, rebrand, rebroadcast, rebuild, rebuilt, recheck, re-cover (cover again), recover (regain possession or use of something, recuperate), recur, recurrence, redeem, redefine, re-edit, re-educate, re-elect, re-election, re-emerge, re-employ, re-engineer, re-enter. re-entry, re-examine, refinance, reinstate, reissue, re-lay (lay again), relay (pass on), remortgage, reopen, reorganize, republish, reread, reroute, rerun, re-sent (sent again), resent (feel indignation), re-sign (sign again), resign (give up or be reconciled to), resold, resole, retry, reunite, reuse, reusable, rewrite.
**Established exceptions include:** re-record, re-release, re-roof. (See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens) for an overview)

**Reader's Digest** (_not_ Readers')

**ready-made** (hyphen)

**real** (adj.) Generally use real to modify nouns ("a real shame" and "the real reason") or to form compound nouns ("real estate"). Prefer **really** (adv.) to mean very ("a really good book" and "a really fast car." Grammarians have contested the use of real as an adverb for more than a century ("a real nice house"). Since the usage remains highly informal, it's considered a really good (versus "real good") idea to avoid it in news stories.

**reality, realization, realize** (_not_ -ise)

**refute, rebut** (These words don't just mean respond or deny. _They imply that an allegation has been proved wrong_ and should be used with _editorial care_.)

**regime** (requires editorial caution in political coverage) Avoid calling governments in bona fide democracies "regimes." In this context, the term conventionally implies totalitarian or non-democratically elected governments. So it's OK to refer to, say, **the Taliban regime, North Korea's regime**, etc., as long as the facts fit. This includes historical references (e.g., **the Gadhafi regime, the Stalin regime**). But avoid labels like the Harper regime, the Nixon regime, etc. Use common sense when assessing whether a country is non-democratic. There is no ideal voting system — from first-past-the-post counting in Canada to regional-based weighting in the U.S. electoral college. Such structural flaws, however, are different from incontestably non-democratic governance. For instance, we have received complaints over the years from people suggesting that places like China and Iran are democracies simply because they hold elections. But China is objectively authoritarian for many reasons, beginning with its single-party system as well as the fact that only a certain percentage of the adult population is granted direct national voting rights. The same is true of the Islamic Republic of Iran, where an unelected body known as the Guardian Council exercises sweeping electoral powers, disqualifying any candidates deemed insufficiently loyal to the clerical establishment that has run the country since the late 1970s. For these reasons, it's acceptable to refer to, say, **China's regime** and **Iran's regime** as occasional synonyms for each country's government. Be aware that in other contexts, the word "regime" has a broader, generic meaning that is normally fine (e.g., **a tax regime, a fitness regime**). See [administration](/home/a#administration) for related guidelines (e.g., the Obama administration but the Trudeau government), as well as [dictator](/home/d#dictator).

**regimen** (a strict routine; a prescribed schedule, especially medical) While expressions such as an **eating regimen** (specific diet) and **exercise regimen** (specific fitness program) are entrenched and accurate, the shorter, related word regime has become an increasingly common synonym (**exercise regime**). Both are acceptable.

The abbreviation Rev. appears before the full names of ministers and [priests](/home/p#priest) from many faiths (e.g., Roman Catholic, Anglican, United Church, Presbyterian, Buddhist). Do not use Rev. or Reverend as a noun for clergy member. For instance, in second reference to **Rev. Frank Jones**, write **Jones says** but _never_ "the Reverend says." By contrast, the honorary title monsignor is conventionally used as a noun. If a cleric is a [monsignor](/home/m#monsignor), Rev. is not required. See [Father](/home/f#Father) for a related note about Catholic priests.

**ride-along** (noun)

**ride-hailing** (hyphen) Preferred description of app-based ride-booking services, such as [UberX](/home/u#UberX), because it's clear and neutral. The term ridesharing, by contrast, has been challenged by critics who say it conveys altruistic "sharing" of a destination, along the lines of carpooling, rather than a commercial transaction between driver and passenger. Some people dislike using "hail" to describe requests made by electronic devices, but it's no different from the word "call" being adopted during the early days of telephones. **Ride-booking** is an acceptable alternative to ride-hailing.

**Rideau Hall**

**Riders, the** (OK in headlines and in second reference to the [Saskatchewan Roughriders](/home/r#Roughriders))

ridesharing (fused) Connotes a "shared" destination, along the lines of carpooling in an era of [HOV lanes](/home/h#HOV). For commercial services, such as [UberX](/home/u#UberX), prefer [ride-hailing](/home/r#ridehailing) or **ride-booking**.

**Road** versus **road** (See [addresses](/home/a/addresses))

**roadblock, roadside, roadwork** (one word); **road rage, road salt, road sign, road trip** (two words). Deciding what's fused in cases like this is heavily dependent on convention. A common criterion is determining whether a given noun (**map, rage, sign**) is stressed more than the word modifying it, or if a compound is generally thought of as a singular noun (e.g., a roadblock, the roadside). The dictionary is a good guide.

**road map** (two words), road map to peace (_avoid_ "[so-called](/home/s/so-called) road map to peace")

**ROM** (read only memory)

**Roma** (plural), **Rom** (singular), **Romani** (n. and adj., as in **Romani people**) Use instead of "Gypsies" or "Gypsy," ethnic labels now widely considered both historically inaccurate and offensive. Rom is based on Romani (sometimes spelled "Romany" outside of scholarly circles), while the roots of "Gyp" are believed to be linked to "Egyptian" — based on false assumptions in Britain in the early 16th century about where this nomadic people came from.

### racial terms

**Racial terms**: Reporting on race and ethnicity

**Overview**

**Few areas of language are as sensitive** as race and ethnicity. **Special care is required.**

The **broad strokes:**

-   Ensure details about race/ethnicity are relevant and necessary.
-   Use suitable language (e.g., accurate, clear, neutral, fair).
-   Prefer direct over euphemistic wording, but stay fact-based.
-   Follow [JSP policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fjournalistic-standards-and-practices-jsp-normes-et-pratiques-journalistiques-npj-1.4517476&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0h3ExU9LO6RqgUI90XlcTe) (e.g., be impartial, include audience warnings as required).

**Narrower caveats:**

-   Avoid confusing "race" and "ethnicity."
-   When umbrella terms are needed, prefer either "racialized" or, in some contexts, "people of colour."
-   **Be cautious before labelling someone or something "racist." Consult an executive producer or managing editor first.**
-   Understand perspective of racialized communities in debates over "racism."
-   Steer clear of ambiguous terms unless defined.
-   Favour simple over lofty (e.g., "white" instead of "Caucasian").
-   Prefer specific over generic (e.g., a "Cree custom" vs. an "Indigenous custom").

The rest of this entry expands on the above points.

**Race, ethnicity, nationality**

**The word race** has been used to describe common ancestry since the 1500s. It **conventionally refers to skin colour**, but race is **a highly imprecise term with debatable meaning** that is provocatively and disputatiously rooted in the field of biology — as some scientists try to measure inherited traits such as blood types, amino acids, enzymes and patterns of congenital conditions and disorders through controversial prisms. Despite past attempts to broadly define racial groups (e.g., Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid, Australoid), evidence suggests these categories are now all mixtures of varying degrees. With modern technology providing greater insight into human genome sequencing, **race is increasingly viewed as a social construct.** Be aware that for many generations, the term frequently conveyed a biological meaning, such as in the [1989 David Suzuki-Philippe Rushton debate](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1827594362) over race and genetics. It's worth noting that more than a century ago, American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois warned against treating "race" as biological classifications for what he said were actually social and cultural differences between different populations. It was simplistic for scientists to use labels like "Black" and "white" to describe discrete groups, Du Bois said, and inaccurate to give any common racial features weight as true biological classifications. Today, a growing number of experts agree.

The term **ethnicity** normally describes those sharing a common culture or heritage. It's not the same as **nationality**, which generally implies either place of birth or current citizenship. For instance, a common and acceptable term such as "[ethnic Albanian](/home/b/balkans#Kosovo)" helps distinguish between a group of people in Kosovo and actual citizens of the neighbouring country of Albania. And while Hispanic and Latino are general ethnic descriptions, Mexican can mean either a citizen of Mexico or someone with Mexican ancestry. (See [Hispanic, Latino, Mexican, etc.](/home/h/hispanic_latino))


**Relevance**

**People's skin colour, ethnic background, etc., should be left out of stories unless the detail is relevant**. In some cases, the connection is obvious. But **avoid the pitfall of mentioning people's racial or cultural backgrounds for no reason — from immaterial detail in general news coverage to crime reporting.** For many journalists, a simple test is whether you would add "white" to the same story if the person were Caucasian.


> Example 1: Reporting that someone is the first Indigenous person appointed to a specific public office is fine if that's the focus of the story. But **gratuitously stating that someone is an Indigenous physician** is as odd and irrelevant as stating that someone is a white physician or a South Asian lawyer.
>
> Example 2: In reporting general crime trends, figures about specific racial backgrounds would be vital to understanding arrest patterns, conviction and incarceration statistics, etc., in an overall assessment of increasing or decreasing systemic racism. But in a specific crime story, **saying that police are looking for someone tall and Black or heavyset and Asian** is not just meaninglessly vague and unnecessary, it can foster bigotry by perpetuating false stereotypes about criminal behaviour. Our default approach, therefore, is to leave out such detail unless it's unambiguously pertinent (e.g., when a B.C. provincial court judge recounted being wrongfully arrested as a young lawyer in downtown Vancouver in the 1970s because some police officers thought he matched the appearance of **a suspect described as being Black** and four and a half inches shorter).
>
> Example 3: **Selectively reporting immigration history can be perceived as racist.** Just as we would not normally write Scottish-born Sir John A. Macdonald when referring to Canada's first prime minister, we should not normally write "**Jamaican-born Ben Johnson**" when referring to the disgraced sprinter. Mentioning a person's place of birth, of course, might be important in a feature that requires biographical information. But do not add facts that serve no obvious editorial purpose.



**Evolving umbrella terms** (racialized, people of colour)

**Prefer specific over general descriptions** when including detail about race or ethnicity (e.g., **Black** instead of people of colour, **Chinese** instead of Asian, **Cree** instead of Indigenous). This is **not always possible, however, when reporting on general trends, diverse communities, etc.**, or when a report is focused on one or more individuals whose backgrounds are unverified or unknown.

There's **no consensus over the best umbrella term**. But some wording should either be avoided or used with care. **Here's a summary of current CBC News style**, based largely on recommendations from our internal language advisory group in early 2023. **Racialized is the default choice.**


[BIPOC](#BIPOC) (generally AVOID unless attributed)
[biracial, multiracial](#biracial) (OK when facts fit)
[non-white](#non-white) (generally AVOID unless attributed)
[people of colour](#POC) (often OK in plural, but do not apply to Indigenous people)
['other' people of colour](#other-POC) (caution required)
[racialized](#racialized) (PREFERRED umbrella term)
[visible minority, racial minority](#visible-minority) (AVOID unless attributed)


**BIPOC** (**generally AVOID unless attributed**) Stands for **Black, Indigenous and people of colour**. While the acronym has been embraced by some as a convenient generic label (e.g., the **BIPOC movement**), it's also been rejected by others who consider it unsuitable for various reasons ― from the identification of only two racialized groups by name (Black and Indigenous) to objections over redundancy (POC includes B) as well as the use of the word "colour" (see [people of colour](#POC) below for details). Given the polarizing nature of BIPOC, as well as comparative audience unfamiliarity (often requiring the letters be spelled out once in stories), [racialized](#racialized) is considered a better choice. **BIPOC is fine in direct quotes and proper nouns** (e.g., the **Vancouver BIPOC Creative Association**), which are all forms of attribution. **But avoid referring to anyone or any group as BIPOC if they're known to object to the term.** For historical perspective: BIPOC was coined around 2013 as an alternative to "POC" (people of colour) in order to stress the unique history of Black and Indigenous people, and to acknowledge the lingering harm of slavery and colonialism. **Steer clear of similar abbreviations unless attributed and explained** (e.g., **BAME** which surfaced in the U.K. around 2002 stands for Black, Asian and minority ethnic).

**biracial and multiracial** (**OK when facts fit**) Common and **acceptable terms for people of mixed racial backgrounds.** Another option is to use descriptions rather than labels (e.g., "His father was Black and his mother was white," or "She's the daughter of Black and South Asian immigrants"). **Be aware that some people prefer specific identities** (e.g., former U.S. president Barack Obama is usually called a Black man rather than a multiracial man), **while others end up being identified in more ways than one**, depending on context (e.g., U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris sometimes refers to herself as a Black woman, sometimes as a biracial woman, sometimes as a Black and South Asian woman, etc.) **Avoid dated terms** such as [mulatto](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mulatto/ "Mulatto") unless people refer to themselves this way, and, even then, be conscious that certain once common terminology is now widely considered offensive.

**non-white** (**generally AVOID unless attributed**) In particular, **guard against usage that implies "white" is a default standard** (e.g., in a story about immigration or demographic trends in Canada). Be aware that some people of colour prefer "non-white" in certain cases because they consider it the clearest way to convey a specific point in a historically monochromatic society. While it's OK to respect such preferences through attribution (broadcast clips and transcribed quotes), the term **[racialized](#racialized) is usually considered better** in our journalism. NOTE: The prefix "non-" can be a succinct way to report relevant binary detail in a range of stories (Black and non-Black students, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people). However, **we should distinguish between including fact-based summaries for context** (e.g., "Until now, all judges nominated to Canada's Supreme Court have been white") **and actually reducing people's identities to whether they're white** (e.g., "He's the first non-white justice nominated to the court"). The latter phrasing should be recast. See [practical application EXAMPLES](#examples) below for details.

**people of colour** (**OK in many, but not all, contexts**) If used, **limit to plural constructions** (e.g., astronauts of colour, Canadians of colour, teachers of colour). **AVOID "person of colour" unless attributed.** This reflects the principle of preferring specifics whenever possible. Also, **do not use as a catch-call term for Indigenous people in Canada.** Generally prefer phrasing such as **Indigenous and other racialized people** (See ['other' people of colour caveat](#other-POC) below). In stories not focused on Indigenous communities, the prepositional construction "of colour" is entrenched and often fine (e.g., "**more athletes of colour**" in hockey, "**more students of colour**" in medical schools, more Indigenous reporters joining groups such as **Canadian Journalists of Colour**). For historical context: **The term "people of colour" first surfaced in the United States** in the late 1970s and originally applied to Black communities. Although it remains relatively popular in the U.S., **be aware that the expression has become polarizing in Canada.**  Critics say it has strong echoes of the racist labels "coloured people" and "coloureds" once ubiquitous in North America. They also say the term can too easily imply that all racialized people are monolithic ― i.e., that the broad label "people of colour" is too frequently used in cases when specific identity is known and more meaningful (e.g., Black, Latino, Arab, Asian, etc.). Furthermore, some academics point out that "white" is also a colour, although this fact is often perceived as relevant only in some parts of the world, depending on a country's demographics.

**'other' people of colour** (**caution required; avoid applying to Indigenous people**) The acronym [BIPOC](#BIPOC) highlights one source of confusion. The B stands for Black people, who are commonly identified as people of colour (POC). In stories about certain types of discrimination (e.g., a rise in **anti-Black racism** or **anti-Asian racism**), "**other people of colour**" may be suitable. By contrast, the I in BIPOC stands for Indigenous people, who are recognized as members of distinct societies in Canada's Constitution (First Nations, Inuit and Métis). Since Indigenous communities determine who is Indigenous, **it's inappropriate to rely on a non-Indigenous classification such as "colour" to define Indigenous people** (see [Indigeneity](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/indigenous/#Indigeneity "Indigenous") for related guidelines). One option is to write "**Indigenous people and people of colour**" (i.e., sans the modifier "other"). Another is to avoid the term "colour" altogether and use "**other racialized people.**" See [practical application EXAMPLES](#examples) below for details.

**racialized** (**PREFERRED umbrella term**) OK in singular or plural usage (e.g., **first racialized person to win the prize, first racialized Governor General, racialized groups, racialized communities**). Coined around 1920, this once obscure word has evolved to replace the outmoded term "visible minority" in Canada. Racialized is tied to the noun racialization, which refers to how an intolerant society can treat people differently based on racial categories or identification. At its core, therefore, the modifier **"racialized" traditionally stresses discrimination, inequality, injustice, unfairness, etc.**, along the lines of **"marginalized."** Nevertheless, since the word "race," itself, is frequently used outside of its narrower meaning (see [race, ethnicity, nationality](#race_ethnicity) above), the term "racialized" has started to follow a similar linguistic path (i.e., as a synonym for people of colour). **Racialized does not normally need to be defined in stories** if the relevant modern meaning is obvious from context (e.g., one or more members of specific racial groups). Be aware that the word has had several meanings over the past century, most of which are now archaic (e.g., "to become racist," in the same way that "radicalized" means "to become radical"). Be aware, too, that some people object to the term racialized for various reasons ― from stylistic (e.g., they consider it fuzzy and bureaucratic) to semantic (e.g., they argue that racialization applies to everyone in a society, including the way that white people have been historically treated differently in North America because of self-endowed privileges). **Although racialized is generally fine when an umbrella term is needed**, bear in mind that **not all Indigenous people and people of colour want to be referred to as "racialized."** We should **respect known preferences** in stories about specific individuals. Since the mid-2010s, **racialized has gradually become the most common default umbrella term used by various institutions in Canada** to mean people whose racial backgrounds are different from the country's white majority (e.g., this 2023 Statistics Canada report, [Housing conditions among racialized groups](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230123/dq230123b-eng.htm)).

**visible minority, racial minority** (**AVOID unless attributed**) These once entrenched terms are **considered outmoded descriptions** of people whose skin colour is different from the majority of citizens in a given region or country. In Canada, the expression "visible minority" was included in various statutes and other legal documents over the years (e.g., the 1995 federal Employment Equity Act). For many decades, it was also a specific classification used by Statistics Canada when compiling and analyzing data. But **demographic changes over time make the word "minority" less meaningful**, especially in the context of regional populations. Also, just as with "people of colour," the terms "visible minority" and "racial minority" have been criticized for frequently and inappropriately lumping all members of diverse communities into a single, homogenous category. As a result, various levels of government, academics, activists and others have switched to "[racialized](#racialized)" and "[people of colour](#POC)."


**Practical application — EXAMPLES**

When racial identity is relevant, **be as precise as possible but also be conscious of how certain wording can be potentially confusing or misleading** when it's too specific.

In 2021, **Mahmud Jamal** became the **first racialized justice named to the Supreme Court of Canada**. While some referred to him as the first BIPOC justice, he was neither Black nor Indigenous, which made the already divisive label BIPOC particularly ill-suited. Although it would have been accurate to report that Jamal was the **first South Asian Canadian to join the country's top court** (he was born in Kenya to parents whose families were originally from India), such precision would have failed to capture the historic nature of the appointment if used as an umbrella term. By contrast, "first racialized" succinctly telegraphed the milestone without reducing Jamal's identity to something he's not (i.e., by calling him the court's first "non-white" justice).

In 2022, **Michelle O'Bonsawin** became the **first Indigenous justice named to the Supreme Court of Canada**. When pertinent, it's accurate to report that she is an **Abenaki member of the Odanak First Nation in Quebec**. But such detail is rarely effective as a clipped umbrella label (e.g., simply describing O'Bonsawin as the only First Nations woman to sit on the Supreme Court could wrongly imply that there have been one or more First Nations men on the court, or that there have been Métis or Inuit justices in the past). While it's clear and accurate to say that Canada didn't start appointing **Indigenous people and people of colour** to its Supreme Court until the 2020s, it's NOT our style to refer to O'Bonsawin as "a person of colour" (see ['other' people of colour](#other-POC) caveat above). If an umbrella term is needed, the recommended default modifier would be [racialized](#racialized) (e.g., O'Bonsawin became **the second racialized justice named to the court**).

In 2021, **Mary Simon became Canada's first Indigenous governor general**. While it's accurate to report that she was the **first Inuk woman** appointed to the position, such wording is comparatively ineffective as an umbrella label because it can wrongly imply that there have been Inuit men who've served in the role, or that there have been other Indigenous governors general but that she was the first with Inuit roots. For historical perspective, in 1984 **Jeanne Sauvé** became the **first woman** sworn in as Canada's governor general, and in 1999 **Adrienne Clarkson** became the **first racialized person to hold the office**. Clarkson was also the first person of Asian heritage and the first Chinese refugee to be governor general, details that she, herself, stressed when talking about diversity and multiculturalism. In 2005, **Michaëlle Jean** became the **first Black person** and only the third woman to serve as the country's federal viceregal representative.

In January 2009, **Barack Obama** was sworn in as the **first Black president** of the United States. He was also the **first racialized person to hold that office**. Do not say he was the "first person of colour" (singular) when this larger historical milestone is intended. For perspective, in 2004 Obama became only the **fifth Black person elected to the U.S. Senate**. But he was not the fifth racialized person to join that legislative body because there had been **other people of colour** in the past. For instance, **Hiram Fong** became the **first Asian American** to enter the U.S. Senate in 1959. Fong was a lawyer and entrepreneur born in Hawaii in 1906 to parents who had immigrated from China the previous century.



**Racism, racist, racially divisive, etc.**

**Racism is a broad label.** It commonly means **a range of intolerance toward people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds — from subtle expressions of prejudice to overt bigotry and hatred.** Racism is sometimes based on ignorance and/or irrational fear of other people and communities, but it can also be rooted in malevolence.

**Brazen racism is relatively easy to report on because it's instantly recognizable and widely condemned** (e.g., people espousing beliefs about the superiority of one race over the other — falsely claiming that certain people have inferior intelligence, lower moral character, a poorer work ethic, etc., based solely on skin colour). **Less obvious racism is comparatively more difficult for journalists to cover because it must first be identified/exposed** (e.g., discriminatory practices of employers, landlords, the police). **The latter includes [systemic racism](/home/s/systemic_systematic)** in institutions, public policy, etc.


**Is it racist?**

**Assessing what is racist/racism is sometimes subjective and controversial.** It can be **helpful to ask rudimentary questions**, such as:


> **1\. Are the details clear and conclusions obvious?** Or could different interpretations be reasonably reached by neutral observers?
>
> **2\. Are we missing a crucial perspective?** In particular, have we considered the views of people from diverse backgrounds?
>
> **3\. Have we taken into account all core JSP principles?** In particular, would using certain language in a given story meet the thresholds of accuracy, fairness and impartiality?


**Consult others if you have any doubts** whether something is racist — especially members of communities with informed views (i.e., colleagues or external sources who can provide first-hand experience, relevant cultural background). **Be open-minded and aware of your own background and potential biases**. Be candid but respectful, understanding that **frank conversations about racism can be emotional and challenging**.


**Racism guidelines: Language, context, etc.**

-   **Distinguish between labelling individuals as racist and their comments, behaviour, etc., as racist.** Bear in mind that many of us can say or do things that are racist without exhibiting a pattern of racism. Some people make mistakes, even though they should know better. Others blunder out of ignorance, unaware that their language or behaviour is highly offensive. **Just because a statement or action is racist doesn't automatically mean the individual behind it is racist.** The rule of thumb: **Generally avoid using the term "racist" to describe a specific person unless the label is attributed or the facts are overwhelming** (e.g., someone consistently espouses racist views, is a member of a flagrantly racist organization). Even then, **REFER UPWARD to an executive producer or managing editor** for a final decision**. Be aware of potential libel**, and any evidentiary threshold that must be met in the eyes of the courts. **Consult the CBC Law Department when in doubt** AFTER first talking to your executive producer.

-   **When facts are incontestable, use direct rather than euphemistic language**. In covering a rally, for instance, we should refer to obvious bigotry as "racist" rather than couch it in softer terms (e.g., as "racially tinged"). And if a landlord is accused of picking tenants based on skin colour, the alleged rental practice is racist not "racially motivated." The same applies to outright references to racial inferiority or superiority — a hateful doctrine that is bald racism, objectively defined. [Blackface is indisputably racist](/home/b/blackface_brownface#indisputably-racist).

-   **When facts are unclear or in dispute, prefer broader language** (racially divisive, racially charged, racially sensitive), **or attribution**. For instance, a call to severely restrict the number of new people coming into a country might be accurately described as "anti-immigration." But automatically labelling a nuanced public policy position as "racist" can move us from fact-based reporting to opinion in a flash. So if activists argue that a given anti-immigration position is racist, we would normally attribute such assertions and conclusions to maintain the principles of balance and impartiality.

**WORTH EXPLORING:** For a compelling look at how the word "racist" can be debatable in news coverage, see a July 2019 column by NPR's public editor: ['Racist,' Not 'Racially Charged': NPR's Thinking On Labeling The President's Tweets](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fpubliceditor%2F2019%2F07%2F23%2F744412665%2Fracist-not-racially-charged-npr-s-thinking-on-labeling-the-president-s-tweets&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1mtdDn6kzsIYgImy2Z2a_2). The piece looks at NPR's internal struggle with characterizing U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that certain members of Congress "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."

-   **When past events are at the centre of a story, keep the passage of time in mind**. Societal standards and mores change. This reality does not justify or excuse racism, but **dates and historical background can provide a more complete picture**. Remember, too, that a given individual's attitudes can evolve.

-   **Whenever practical, use stories about racism to help educate our audience about why certain images, phrases, etc., are offensive**. Some points are obvious (e.g., calling people subhuman). But other racist tropes may require a brief explanation.

-   **Strive to help debunk the myth that there is little to no racism in Canada** today. **Decisions we make from story selection** (assignment/pitch) **to production** (including the people we interview and the way scripts are written) **can shine a light on intolerance and discrimination — by individuals as well as by private/public institutions**. Canada was the first country in the world to introduce a national multiculturalism policy in the 1970s. But **enshrining cultural diversity as a fundamental part of Canadian society didn't erase historical wrongs** against Indigenous people, against Black people oppressed by slavery laws, and against other non-white people, such as Japanese citizens put into internment camps during the Second World War. **Furthermore, many Canadians continue to experience personal and institutional racism today**.

**Related language**

**Follow JSP guidelines on language.** In particular, "[words that shock](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Flanguage-langue-1.4523261&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw00j0MyNt5WClLhwDOEulcB)" must be justified, and audience warnings given in advance on all platforms — broadcast and digital. (See [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language) for related direction.)

**Be precise and accurate, and adhere to CBC News style.** For example: There's a difference between an [apology](/home/a#apology) and an expression of regret. The term [blackface](/home/b/blackface_brownface) is common and instantly understood, but it's not an umbrella term. And while "white supremacy" is OK when incontestably accurate, entrenched labels such as "[nationalism](/home/n#nationalism)," "[white nationalism](/home/w#white_nationalism)" and "[alt-right](/home/a#alt-right)" may have their place in certain stories, too, depending on the facts.

**Avoid obscure or ambiguous terminology unless defined**.

**Avoid archaic terms** (e.g., [Negro](/home/n#Negro) or coloured), **and prefer simple over lofty** (e.g., white instead of Caucasian).

**Remember that specific information is usually better than vague labels** (e.g., "He's from Pakistan" rather than "He's South Asian," and "It's a Cree custom" rather than "It's an Indigenous custom").


**'Black' vs. 'black'**

**Capitalize Black when referring to racial identity or culture** (e.g., a Black student, the Black community, Black music, anti-Black hashtags). **Use lowercase black to mean colour** (e.g., black skin, black makeup, blackface). This means a dermatologist might talk about different rates of skin cancer among Black people, as well as about different shades of black skin. **Avoid using Black as a noun** (e.g., write "Black voters" not "Blacks" casting votes).

**CBC News adopted this style in June 2020 to:**

-   **Acknowledge** the distinctiveness of shared **Black history** and **Black culture**.
-   **Respect** frequently voiced preferences of **Black people**.
-   **Reflect** increasingly **common usage in Canada.**

BACKGROUND: There has been a deeply entrenched publishing convention to use lowercase letters for racial, ethnic and nationality labels not directly rooted in proper nouns (e.g., African, European and Latino, but "black," "white" and "brown"). English, however, evolves. We started capitalizing [Indigenous, Aboriginal and Native](/updates/2016/2016-04-21) in 2016, for example, to recognize that those words reflect people's distinct identities and cultures. Writing Black with a capital "B" has strong parallels. Although insisting on "black" satisfies old and debatable typographical rules, it doesn't mirror the realities of Black history and Black culture. It also fails to clearly and suitably flag personal identities the way that dozens of routinely capitalized terms do (e.g., Arab, Asian, Caribbean, Caucasian, Celtic, Hispanic, Roma, South Asian).


**Keep 'white,' 'brown,' etc., lowercase**

**Use lowercase white across the board** (e.g., a white police officer, white nationalism, white privilege, white skin). **Other colours less commonly convey people's racial or ethnic identities**. But **when they surface, keep the words lowercase** (e.g., "She urged unity and reconciliation, 'whether Black, brown or white, gay, straight or transgender'…"). This includes all variations of pigmentation shades and descriptions (e.g., bronze, dark, ebony, olive and tan).

A FEW MORE WORDS ABOUT WHITE: The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage warns, "If you choose to capitalize 'black' but not 'white' you should probably explain the reasons for this decision to the reader, who may find the inconsistency puzzling or annoying." **We continue to use "white" for three reasons:**


> (i) There's no compelling evidence of a comparable shared "white history" or "white culture."
>
> (ii) The umbrella term "white" refers to people with lighter skin, mainly of European descent, who already enjoy various capitalized terms to express their identities (e.g., Baltic, Irish, Nordic, Slavic).
>
> (iii) There's no widespread championing of "White" in everyday English. Instead, the most passionate advocates also often appear to promote white separatism and white supremacy.



**NOTE:** We're aware that there is disagreement over **"white" versus "White."** We have reviewed current and historical arguments for and against each. We believe "white" remains the most sensible editorial approach for the moment. But **we will review our decision if Canadian English usage shifts**. This commitment is part of our overall approach to the fluid nature of language, and the need to revisit and, when appropriate, to revise our style manual.



**Geographical references, compounds** (African American, Korean Canadian)

**Geographical demonyms are often OK** when relevant to a story. These can be general (_African, Asian, European, South Asian_) or specific to a country (_Brazilian, Chinese, Colombian,_ _Vietnamese_). Be aware that **such labels are NOT normally racial descriptions on their own. Instead, they frequently reflect either nationality/citizenship or ethnicity** (cultural background). **They can also denote a direct relationship with a given country, continent, etc., that is shorthand for "of, in, about, from," and so forth** (e.g., _African heads of state_, _Japanese food_, the _German delegation_).

**It's an acceptable convention to use certain adjectival constructions to keep reporting conversational** (e.g., sometimes writing **French President** Emmanuel Macron instead of **France's President** Emmanuel Macron). Related capitalization guidelines are found in the [apposition latitude](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/titles/#apposition "Titles") section of our titles overview. **But avoid needless ambiguity that can be easily misinterpreted, especially if the wording might demonize a racialized community.** For example, **when referring to a country** (China) **rather than to its citizens, or to [diaspora](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/#diaspora "D") living in other parts of the world** (Chinese people), **use wording that's unambiguous**. Options include adding detail (e.g., "the Chinese government), recasting with a possessive (e.g., China's ) or some other phrasing, such as a metonym (e.g., allegations of meddling by Beijing). This is particularly important in stories involving documented or alleged impropriety, which can be misread out of context, especially in headlines, TV banners, etc.

Chinese government interference — (OK)
China's interference — (OK)
Beijing's interference — (OK)
Chinese interference — (POOR because it can demonize all Chinese people)

**Even when reporting on individuals** rather than on countries, **geographical compounds are not always the best choice. Convention and context are relevant factors.
**
For example, **generally prefer _Black_ over dual labels** like _African American_ and _African Canadian_ unless the latter is expressly preferred by a given individual.

> _Michaëlle Jean, Canada's first Black Governor General, was born in Haiti.
> _
>
> _In 2004, Barack Obama became the fifth Black American to sit in the U.S. Senate._


Terms such as African Canadian are usually poorer because they (i) presume both the continent of origin and current citizenship; (ii) do not describe Black people from other parts of the world; and (iii) could technically apply to white immigrants from Africa. Exceptions are made for directly transcribed quotes and established proper nouns (e.g., _the African American Federal Executive Association_).

**TIP: To avoid errors, never assume a geographical compound applies. Check first.** Someone might actually be **Caribbean American** rather than **African American**. Or perhaps neither. As already mentioned, when such detail is relevant and accurate, the broader term Black is usually better.

**Leave out hyphens in virtually all dual heritage compounds.** This applies to nouns and adjectives:


> African American
>
> African Nova Scotian
>
> French Canadian roots
>
> German Australian
>
> a Japanese Canadian family
>
> the first Korean Canadian MP
>
> Mexican American
>
> Ukrainian Canadian


The above approach also **applies to  descriptions of individuals with dual citizenship.**


**Exceptions are:**

-   Proper nouns that feature hyphens (e.g., the **African-American Mennonite Association**)
-   Clipped words that function as prefixes (e.g., "Indo" in **[Indo-Canadian](/home/s/south-asian-indian-indo-canadian)** and "Anglo" in **Anglo-American**)

Be aware that **hyphens used to be commonplace** in dual heritage and dual nationality constructions. Since the mid-2010s, however, there's been **a growing trend to drop the punctuation for various reasons** — including concerns that it can inadvertently imply divided loyalty, split identity, second-class citizenship, hierarchical declaration, etc. While editors have debated the merits of such arguments, there has been widespread agreement that the hyphens, themselves, serve no important editorial purpose (i.e., they're unnecessary for clarity). **The Associated Press eliminated the punctuation in 2019** (e.g., "African-American" became African American across the board, whether written as a noun or adjective). **CBC News adopted this style in 2020. We also discourage using the modifier "hyphenated" in dual heritage descriptions** (e.g., referring to "hyphenated Canadians" or to "hyphenated Americans") unless directly attributed.

**Indigenous, First Nations, etc.**

The uppercase term **Indigenous refers to all First Nations people, Inuit and Métis in Canada**. The uppercase compound **First Nations**, by contrast, **conventionally refers only to status and non-status Indians**. See **[Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous)** for detailed guidelines.

The words **Aboriginal and Native are largely considered outdated** now. So **prefer Indigenous** unless reporting a verbatim quote or referring to a proper noun. When used, **Aboriginal and Native are modifiers** **not nouns** (e.g., NEVER refer to "an Aboriginal" or to "a Native").

**Avoid the word [Eskimo](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk#Eskimo)** (still used by some in Alaska) **to describe people in northern Canada**.

**Do not confuse [Inuit and Inuk](/home/i/inuit-and-inuk)**.

**Do not confuse Inuit** (Indigenous people in Canada's Arctic) **and Innu** (members of a First Nations people in Labrador and northeastern Quebec).

See also [**controversial sports team names**](/home/c/controversial-team-names) (Indians, Eskimos, etc.) for important caveats.

**People from India are traditionally called Indian**. But given North America's history, the demonym sometimes requires care. Always ensure the necessary context is provided to make the meaning clear. **Avoid the term [East Indian](/home/s/south-asian-indian-indo-canadian)**.


### rack versus wrack

**Rack versus wrack**

We almost always write “rack” in stories.


**rack**
In addition to describing **a pole for clothing** (_off the rack_) and **a toothed device** (_rack-and-pinion steering_), the word means **stretch, strain or torture** (_nerve-racking, rack one’s brain, racked with pain_, etc.)


**wrack**
Wrack is **an archaic term for “wreck”** that crops up in quotes from time to time (e.g., _wrack and ruin_). This is the only time we use _wrack_.

Some dictionaries list wrack as an alternative spelling of “rack” in a few common expressions. But we leave the “w” off for consistency.

### railway versus railroad

**Railway versus railroad**

**Use "railway" as the generic term** (lowercase, **not** part of a company’s proper name), **whether referring to Canada or other countries:**

_Every year, more railway lines are abandoned on the Prairies.
The warning lights were working at the time of the accident, according to the railway._

**The word railroad** (lowercase) should be **reserved for hobbies** (_model railroading_), **lyrics** (_"I’ve been working on the ..."_) and some **figurative expressions** (_"He says they were railroaded into accepting the deal"_).

More background on the Canadian preference for "railway" can be found at the bottom of this entry.


**Railway, Railroad, Rail Road**
Proper nouns can take an unexpected track, so be sure to get each company’s name correct. **Some firms use Railway while others use Railroad.** There are also variations, including **Rail Road**. Here are some examples:

Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (Burlington Northern in second reference)
Canadian National Railway (also known as Canadian National or CN)
Canadian Pacific Railway (also CP or Canadian Pacific in second reference; formerly called CP Rail)
Kansas City Southern Railway
Long Island Rail Road (two words)
National Railroad Passenger Corporation (but use Amtrak in all references)
Union Pacific Railroad
VIA Rail Canada (use Via Rail and then Via in second reference, never VIA uppercase)


**In certain names, the words "railway" and "railroad" have been officially dropped**.

Canadian Pacific Kansas City ([**CPKC**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#CPKC "C"))

Can be called **CPKC rail** or **CPKC railway** in first reference if the lowercase sector detail is needed in a headline, etc.

**Why railway instead of railroad?**
**The choice between these generic terms** (lowercase, not part of a company’s name) **is based on convention** not on etymology or a logical distinction.

Rail came to Middle English from the Old French term for "iron rod" (_reille_), which in turn is based on the Latin word for "rule" or "straight stick" (_regula_). Way was carted into Old English from the German and Dutch terms for "move or carry" (_weg_). Road is an Old English term for journey by horseback (rad), which is related to the verb "ride" (_ridan_).

The words "railroad" and "railway" have been closely tied since the 19th century. But **in this country "railway" is used far more**, according to the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage. It’s also the preferred choice in Britain. **"Railroad," on the other hand, is much more common in the United States.**

The CBC receives email complaints when people slip "railroad" into news stories. **Using "railway" seems to be as important to some Canadians as the spelling "colour"** (instead of color), **the choice of "[half-mast](/home/h/half-mast)"** (instead of half-staff) and the pronunciation "zed" (instead of "zee").

We’re not alone in our preference for "railway." Many other news organizations in this country take the same stand, including The Canadian Press and the Globe and Mail. In its 2003 style manual, the Globe boldly states: "Railway is the Canadian term."

### rape versus sexual assault

**Rape versus sexual assault**

**Rape is not a legal term in Canada. Don't use it in that context.** It once had a specific legal meaning in this county. It no longer does. **If using the word in our journalism:**

-   **Never report or suggest that someone in Canada has been charged with rape**, except in rare historical references when that specific criminal offence existed. The current charges are sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon and aggravated sexual assault.


-   **Be certain any generic use of the word rape refers to intercourse against a victim's will**, since that's what our audience will assume. It has a much narrower meaning than sexual assault.


-   **Make sure qualifying words are used as required** (e.g., "alleged rape" or "alleged sexual assault" unless the story's context already makes this detail obvious). **When in doubt, check with the CBC Law Department**. Until proven in court, accusations are just that — whether we use specific legal language, such as homicide and murder, or generic language such as killing or fatal shooting.

**Example:** If detectives say a teenager was drugged and _raped_ by several people at a rave party in B.C., that language is fine in stories. Headlines and TV banners can also refer to a _gang rape_, if police say that's what happened, because it underscores the horror of the crime without being inaccurate or sensational. A qualifying word such as "alleged" is not necessarily needed in web headlines or TV supers if accompanying coverage makes it clear that these are unproven allegations. As soon as any people are actually arrested and prosecuted, however, we must not claim that they've been charged with rape. Check with the Law Department if you have any doubts about specific wording from a legal standpoint.


> **Acceptable TV banners**, as long as context is clear: _B.C. gang rape and Rape at rave_
> **Acceptable web headline**, as long as context is clear: _Rave rape witnesses must step up: RCMP_
> **Acceptable lead,** since the police attribution makes the "allegation" context clear: _The RCMP are pleading for more people who saw the gang rape of a 16-year-old at a large party near Vancouver two weeks ago to come forward._


**Nothing above prevents the choice of "sexual assault" instead of "rape," if a CBC journalist prefers that language for a particular story.** It merely outlines acceptable use of "rape." In certain cases, picking that powerful, monosyllabic word can actually help our audience's understanding of a case — instantly distinguishing it from other types of sexual assault.

The rest of this entry offers more detailed direction on:
**Citing specific charges
Generic use of rape, date rape drug, etc.**

**
Citing specific charges**
In Canada, there is no longer a criminal offence called rape. In 1983, it was replaced by the crimes of sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon (or other threatening means), and aggravated sexual assault. Parliament said the change was to emphasize that these are crimes of violence. Since the Crown no longer has to prove that there was actual sexual intercourse (the old law required evidence of "penetration"), it can now prosecute a wider range of assaults of a sexual nature. The Criminal Code revisions also made it easier to charge men with sexually assaulting their spouses.

**To keep our stories accurate, it's important to report on the specific charges that have been laid:** assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault, etc. **When in doubt about the facts, check** with police, consult court documents or talk to the lawyers or prosecutors involved.


**Generic use of rape, date-rape drug, etc.**
**Since rape has a narrower meaning than sexual assault, we must be careful when using it to avoid any misleading or sensational references.** In summary:

-   **Sexual assault** broadly means touching someone on purpose in a sexual way, directly or indirectly, without consent. **Aggravated sexual assault** means the victim was also seriously injured when the crime was committed.


-   **Rape is more specific.** It does not normally convey the idea of mere fondling, kissing, etc. **It conventionally means forcing someone to have sexual intercourse. So the word rape can't simply be tossed in a story as a synonym for sexual assault.** Known details must match the language we use.

The same guidelines apply to **gang rape**. That term implies that several people forced an individual to have sexual intercourse. It does not suggest that a crowd was merely present and watching without trying to help the victim (as abhorrent as that description is). It means that several members of the crowd (a gang) were actively involved in the sexual assault.

The term **date-rape drug** is a widely used and acceptable term for sedatives and other substances slipped into alcoholic drinks without the victim realizing it. Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), also known as ketamine, and gamma butyrolactone (GBL) are common examples.

### RCMP are versus RCMP is

**RCMP are versus RCMP is**

RCMP does not require periods, which are generally reserved for geographical terms. (See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)) When spelled out, Royal Canadian Mounted Police is capitalized.

**The letters RCMP normally take a plural verb** unless the story is about the entire force:

_The RCMP are investigating the allegations.
The RCMP plan to hold a news conference Thursday._

The entire force is not looking into the alleged conspiracy. The entire force is not holding a news conference. Some Mounties are.

So when "P" represents a few police officers, treat the abbreviation RCMP as plural. (We would not say that the "police is" investigating, or that the "police plans" to hold a news conference.)

**When the RCMP "force" is at the heart of the story, however, treat the abbreviation as singular:**

_The RCMP has a new commissioner.
The RCMP is hoping to have closer ties with the FBI._

For a more detailed discussion, see the Words: Woe & Wonder column [Media, Mounties and Maple Leaves](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fplurals.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2EK-7bsWFeRVso1lzbYkYt).

See also [plurals](/home/p/plurals) (an overview)

### Realtor

**Realtor**

This word is a [**trademark**](/home/t/trade-names) in Canada and **must be capitalized**.

**It is _not_ merely an abbreviation for “real estate agent,”** and should not be treated as one.

Realtors can be agents, brokers, developers, property managers, and so forth.

In Canada, “Realtor” refers to a member of the Canadian Real Estate Association. (In the United States, the word means someone who belongs to the National Association of Realtors.)

**In most news stories, we can simply avoid “Realtor”** (unless membership in the above associations is an issue) **and call people “real estate agents,” “the agent who helped sell their home,”** etc.

### recession

**Recession**

A recession is **defined by many economists as two or more consecutive quarters** (six months) **of declining economic activity** (lower real [GDP](/home/g/gdp-versus-gnp)).

Statistics Canada, however, does not classify recessions this neatly. It looks at the size and duration of the downturn, as well as its effects on such things as employment and per capita income.

For a country or region to slide into a recession, the economy must actually be in a slump (e.g., fewer jobs, less production, etc.), and not merely slowing down (i.e., expanding at a slightly slower pace).

Depressions are far more severe than recessions, last longer and tend to be worldwide. Canada has experienced two depressions: from 1873-79, and from 1929-39.

### referendum versus plebiscite

**Referendum versus plebiscite**

The differences between these words are subtle and not always recognized by the people actually calling the votes. **When reporting on the Quebec sovereignty movement, we traditionally use referendum (plural referendums)** because of convention. The rest of this entry outlines the main distinctions between plebiscites and referendums.

**A referendum _is_ binding. A plebiscite _might_ be. _But what really sets them apart is the type of question asked._**


**Referendum**
Technically, a **referendum invites people within a group** (e.g., citizens of a country or a province, members of an organization) **to decide if a specific law or constitutional measure should be passed.** The matter is being "referred" to them, and **the authority calling for the vote must follow the results.** True referendums are _common in the U.S._ and some other countries (especially at the local or regional level), but they're _rare in Canada_.


**Plebiscite**
**A plebiscite, on the other hand, involves asking people for their views on an issue** rather than on the specific wording of proposed legislation or a constitutional amendment. **Such votes can give a governing body direction on forming policy** (e.g., should a province enter into negotiations to separate from the rest of the country, should fluoride be added to the drinking water, and so forth). **A plebiscite is binding only if the authority that calls for the vote pledges to follow the resul**ts.


**Quebec independence 'referendums'**
Based on the above definitions, it's obvious that some _historic "referendums" in Canada have actually been plebiscites_. In 1980, for instance, Quebec residents were asked if the province's governing separatist party should have a mandate to negotiate sovereignty-association. They were not asked to vote on a specific proposal for a new relationship with Canada. But **the term "referendum" is now an entrenched part of the debate over Quebec's independence, and, so, is almost always used in coverage of secession-related votes.** Even the federal government's 2000 Clarity Act refers to the word throughout.

**In other news stories, we should preserve the distinction between plebiscites and referendums whenever possible. But if a governing authority insists on labelling a specific vote a "referendum" or a "plebiscite," it's generally better to adopt this language**, with or without attribution, **to reduce confusion**. This is especially true when a well-known provincial or national vote is almost universally branded a referendum despite having the characteristics of a plebiscite, such as the defeat of the Charlottetown accord in the fall of 1992. (In that case, Canadians were asked only whether their first ministers should move ahead with some constitutional amendments. Ottawa, the provinces and the territories planned to work out the final language themselves.)

**Referendums, not 'referenda'**
For details on why we use referendums instead of "referenda," see [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals)

### refugee

**Refugee, asylum seeker, migrant**

[illegal migration](/home/r/refugee#illegalmigration) but not "illegal" migrants

The words **immigrant** and **emigrant** imply voluntary and lawful travel to and from countries, and, so, are **not normally used in stories about displaced people**. Language such as **refugee, asylum seeker** and **migrant** are **commonly used instead**. Although all three terms can be broadly treated as synonyms, depending on context, there are subtle differences worth noting:


**refugee**
**OK in a general sense to mean people seeking refuge or asylum**. It's derived from the Latin term for "flee" (_fugere_). **Technically, refugee also has a narrower, legal definition** (e.g., Canada and other countries have rules about granting or rejecting refugee status). **But in stories about mass migration caused by wars, famine, etc., the word can be used to refer to displaced people in general** — along the lines of "refugee camps" in various parts of the world. In coverage of individual refugee adjudications, however, it's normally clearest to use whatever specific language applies (e.g., "refugee claimant"). Context matters. For example, after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were allowed to enter Canada to live, work and study under a special emergency travel and residency program. Since they fled a war zone, it was OK to call them **Ukrainian refugees** because this generic term succinctly and meaningfully conveyed their displacement. But it was also important to avoid implying that they were seeking permanent asylum through Canada's regular refugee process. One way to keep stories clear was to include background on how long specific **Ukrainian nationals** were authorized to stay in Canada, if they were students or had jobs, if any of them intended to apply to remain longer, etc.


**asylum seeker**
**An acceptable and increasingly common compound to describe refugees**, including some migrants caught sneaking across the U.S. border into Canada after the 2016 presidential election. It's a good choice to use at least once in stories because it's so unambiguous. "Asylum" is derived from the Greek word for refuge or sanctuary (_asulon_). Decades ago, the term was usually associated with Cold War defections. But "asylum seeker" is now frequently applied to displaced people seeking a haven from danger or tragedy.


**migrant**
**OK as a synonym for refugee and asylum seeker as long as the context is clear**. Since "migrant" means "to move" (e.g., migrant farm workers), the word on its own does not automatically capture the human misery of mass migration caused by wars, famine, etc. For this reason, it's generally best to establish context by including unambiguous terms in our coverage, such as asylum seekers or refugees, instead of relying solely on "migrants." While some writers and editors prefer second reference usage only, the term migrant is generally fine in headlines, too, where space is at a premium. (See also [migrant workers, temporary foreign workers](/home/m/migrant_foreign_worker))


**permanent residents, citizens**
It normally takes several years before refugees are eligible to become permanent residents of Canada, and even longer to obtain citizenship. Along the way, their official status may change to some obscure government classification (e.g., "designated foreign nationals"). But such **jargon is virtually meaningless unless defined, and can make the tone of stories highly bureaucratic**. Instead, **prefer continued use of a word such as refugee at least once in stories**, along with common descriptions such as "newcomer," **until permanent residency is established**. Decades after people arrive in Canada, of course, it's common for words such as "immigrant" or "refugee" to surface when this background is relevant to a given story (e.g., "Sir John A. Macdonald was an immigrant from Scotland," and "She came to Alberta as a Vietnamese refugee in 1979").


**illegal border crossing, irregular border crossing**
It's against the law to enter Canada without the proper papers, and without going through an official port of entry during designated operating hours, according to the federal Customs Act. Asylum seekers are not prosecuted for such illegal crossings, pending a review of their refugee applications, according to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. But this does not make the crossing, itself, lawful. The government reserves the right to pursue charges later. Applicable international law uses similar language. For example, the [UN Status of Refugees Convention and Protocol](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Fprotection%2Fbasic%2F3b66c2aa10%2Fconvention-protocol-relating-status-refugees.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EXhW8XzR42mFChyQ9XGrW) specifically refers to such unauthorized border crossings as "illegal entry." The convention goes on to state that countries "shall not impose penalties" on refugee claimants solely because of "their illegal entry" as long as they "present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence." For this reason, it's OK to use terms such as **illegal border crossings** and **unlawful border crossings**.

Some politicians and refugee activists prefer the term **irregular border crossings**. While the word "irregular" is becoming more common, choosing between "illegal" and "irregular" is now also seen by some as a partisan decision. CBC News strives to avoid taking sides in political debates over language. **We believe the modifier "illegal" is generally preferable** because it is accurate and entrenched, and, so, instantly helps our audience understand the story. **“Irregular” is less familiar and more bureaucratic, but there's no ban against using the word as long as a given story's context makes its meaning clear**. Just be sure to explain or define "irregular border crossing" if you use the term (e.g., "refugee claimants entering Canada without going through official border points"). It's worth noting that "irregular" is a statutory designation found in Section 20.1 of Canada's 2001 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The once-obscure jargon started becoming more widely used by federal officials in 2017.


**illegal migration**
Be aware that while the modifier **illegal** is an entrenched and **acceptable way to describe the general act of unlawful movement** across borders (e.g., **illegal immigration** and **illegal migration**), it's viewed by many as **a poor way to describe people**, themselves. Instead of using a term such as "[illegal immigrant](/home/i/illegal_immigration)," therefore, prefer specific detail (e.g., "entering or living in a country illegally"). Another option is to use a neutral modifier that applies to a given set of facts (e.g., **undocumented worker**). The same principle applies to asylum seekers and refugee claimants. While it's OK to describe an act as technically unlawful (e.g., an [illegal border crossing](/home/r/refugee#illegalcrossing)), **we should not call people "illegal border crossers."** Avoid shorthand such as "an illegal" or rounding up "the illegals," which reduces the identities of human beings to a criminal act they're accused of committing.

### reign versus rein

**Reign versus rein**

**Reign means to hold office** (a _person's reign_), **especially when referring to royalty** (the King_'s reign_). A constitutional monarch _reigns but does not rule_.

Reign also means **to prevail** (_confusion reigns, Reign of Terror, reign supreme_), **and to hold a title** (_reigning champion_).

**Rein means a leather strap or other type of restraint** (_rein in, keep a tight rein on, free rein_). It can also mean **a symbol of power** (as in the _reins of_ government).

Be particularly careful not to confuse a person's _reign_ with the _reins of power_ when writing about authority.

### replacement worker

**Replacement workers**

**Prefer the neutral term "replacement workers"** for someone brought in to perform the jobs of those locked out or on strike.
**
Generally avoid the noun "strikebreakers."** The vague term could mean replacement workers or members of striking unions who have decided to cross their own picket lines. The word is also problematic in the case of lockouts, since these are not technically "strikes."

Note: Accusing someone of crossing a picket line can be very serious if the allegation is unfounded. It may also put an alleged strikebreaker at risk during a heated contract dispute.

**Avoid inflammatory and pejorative terms (e.g., "scab")** unless attributed in directly transcribed quotes.

Prefer the neutral term "**contract dispute**" over [labour dispute](/home/l#labourdispute), since the disagreements involve both management and labour.

See also: [strike versus lockout](/home/s#strike)

### Residential schools

**Residential schools**

**The noun "residential schools" does not need to be defined** in our journalism. **Whenever practical, however**, it's helpful to **provide brief context**.

Residential schools were church-run, government-funded boarding centres for Indigenous children that operated in Canada for more than 100 years. Indian, Inuit and Métis children were removed from their families and culture and forced to learn English, embrace Christianity and adopt the customs of the country's white majority. In 2008, the federal government formally apologized for the residential school system and other policies of assimilation. **Avoid phrasing that suggests the program involved voluntary enrolment** (i.e., do NOT simply say children "attended" or "went to"). Instead, always make it clear that they were "forced to attend" or "required to go to."

**Although no modifier is required, if placing an adjective before residential schools choose Indigenous rather than "First Nations"** (which is technically limited to status and non-status Indians).

When reporting on the suffering and loss of young Indigenous people taken from their families and forced to attend residential schools, the term **survivor** has become the preferred way to describe former students. It refers to surviving a harmful policy of assimilation, of being victims of abuse — emotional, and in some cases physical and sexual. The label **former students** generally remains fine, especially when suffering and loss is not the story's focus, or when individuals being reported on have specifically said they don't consider themselves "survivors." It's also OK as a synonym for variety, if you feel the word survivor is becoming overly repetitive within a piece. **Be aware that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada used both terms** ("former student" and "survivor") in its final report. It also called for the creation of a **National Residential School Student Death Register**.

### Pronunciation FAQs

**When Canada's monarch dies:****
Crown succession facts, terminology**

**In many ways, reporting on the death of Canada's Queen or King is no different from any other story about the end of a life.** It requires mindfulness about everything from the **tone of overall coverage** to the **accuracy of words** chosen. **In other ways, however, the story is unique because of how central the Queen or King is to a parliamentary democracy** that's also a constitutional monarchy — from the omnipresence of the person's name and portrait, including on our currency, to the role of the Crown in passing laws and prosecuting offenders. **It's also unique because we cannot ignore the inevitable calls from some citizens to end ties with the Royal Family** and have Canada start electing its head of state. We would not be doing our jobs if we ignored criticism of the monarchy as an institution. At the same time, we must remember that to a large number of Canadians, the death of a steadfast figure who's been on the throne for many years can be, in some ways, akin to the death of a family member. **The key is balance and respect.**

**This entry answers common questions that have come up in the past about how to report on the death of Canada's monarch.** The FAQs were written in the spring of 2022, the year Queen Elizabeth, then 96, marked 70 years on the throne. THE TEXT WAS UPDATED IN THE DAYS AFTER HER DEATH in September of the same year:

1\. [Is there specific wording to use when reporting the Queen's death?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ1 "Royal succession FAQs") No.
2\. [Is it accurate to call Charles the new King?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ2 "Royal succession FAQs") Yes.
3\. [Will he be King Charles III?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ3 "Royal succession FAQs") Probably. Yes. (Confirmed hours after Elizabeth's death on Sept. 8, 2022).
4\. [Can we drop the 'III' in most stories?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ4 "Royal succession FAQs") Yes.
5\. [Does he become King of Canada?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ5 "Royal succession FAQs") Yes.
6\. [Is it OK to refer to Camilla as the Queen Consort?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ6 "Royal succession FAQs") Potentially. Yes. (Confirmed hours after Elizabeth's death.)
7\. [Does William instantly become Prince of Wales?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ7 "Royal succession FAQs") No. (UPDATE: New title granted the day after Charles became King.)
8\. [Will the funeral be a national day of mourning?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ8 "Royal succession FAQs") Yes.
9\. [Do we get new money right away?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ9 "Royal succession FAQs") No.
10\. [Will some proper nouns change?](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/#FAQ10 "Royal succession FAQs") Yes.

**1\. Is there specific wording to use when reporting the Queen's death?** **No.**
**The first key editorial consideration is accuracy. This means the death must be confirmed** by an official source (e.g., a palace news bulletin). The source's authenticity needs to be verified before we broadcast or publish the news, and our initial bulletins should include the attribution at some point fairly high up, although not necessary in the lead. We do not report on rumours of the monarch's death (e.g., based on unverified reports by other media or on claims being made on social media). Be aware that even official websites and personal online accounts can be hacked as part of an elaborate hoax. At the end of the day, being right is more important than scrambling to be first by a few seconds. **Once we decide to run with the story, there's no set script that must be used.** An on-air lead could be as brief and powerful as: "**Queen Elizabeth is dead.**" Certainly there are other options, especially as the hours roll by and the story becomes more about reaction, funeral plans and the heir's ascension. Some journalists, for instance, may want to stress her historical status, including how many years she was on the throne, in their leads. And, of course, the medium can make a difference. A web piece, for instance, might have far more detailed opening paragraphs with comparatively long but still compelling subordinate clauses that are deemed suitable for the eye.

NOTE: It's a myth that as a Crown corporation we handle breaking news about the monarch's death in some roundabout, highly formal way. A few generations ago, when TV was in its infancy and mobile devices like smartphones were found only in science fiction books, the protocol might have been to prepare the masses for bad news by, say, playing sombre music on air for several minutes before reading rather flowery prose. Now, however, it seems more appropriate simply to interrupt regular programming for major breaking news that's conveyed in a clear, direct way.

**2\. Is it accurate to call Charles the new King?** **Yes.**
**Charles automatically becomes King the moment Elizabeth dies**, which means his reign begins immediately, regardless of when the official coronation ceremony is held. The latter might not actually take place for many months or longer. In Elizabeth's case, for instance, she became Queen in February 1952 but wasn't ceremoniously crowned until June of 1953. **Charles** can be said to be the **new monarch**, the **King**, to have **ascended to the throne**, etc. A reminder that **the possessive of Charles is Charles's.** There is a statutory protocol in place that symbolically confirms the change in monarch. This involves a body known as the Accession Council in the United Kingdom, which normally convenes within 48 hours of the sovereign's death to sign documents and issue a ceremonial proclamation. Ottawa's representative is traditionally the High Commissioner of Canada (the equivalent of an ambassador to the U.K.). Regardless, **Charles can still be referred to as King before the Accession Council meets.** Its proclamation from St. James's Palace simply confirms in writing what is already a reality. Be aware that in the event the Queen became so severely incapacitated that medical experts said she could no longer perform her duties as monarch, Charles would become **Prince Regent** rather than "King," unless Elizabeth abdicated.

**3\. Will he be King Charles III?** Probably.**Yes. (Confirmed hours after Elizabeth's death on Sept. 8, 2022).**
One of the first details to confirm after Elizabeth's death is what's known as her successor's "regnal name" — i.e., what the monarch decides to call himself. Therefore, **do NOT use the name King Charles III until it's confirmed by an official spokesperson**, such as the private secretary to the sovereign, the Buckingham Palace press office or the communications secretary at Clarence House. Although the odds may not be great in the eyes of some bookies, **it's possible that the King could pick a different regnal name**. Many past monarchs have gone this route. For example, Elizabeth's father King George VI had previously been known as Prince Albert. **Charles's options include King Philip I and King George VII**, which are already part of his formal name (Charles Philip Arthur George).

**4\. Can we drop the 'III' in most stories?** **Yes.**
Assuming the new monarch sticks with what people have called him since 1948, **the name King Charles on its own will normally be sufficient in most news reports**. Just as we rarely referred to Queen Elizabeth as "Elizabeth II" in routine stories, there will be no need to insist on Charles III across the board.

**5\. Does he become King of Canada?** **Yes.**
**The King or Queen of the United Kingdom is automatically the King or Queen of Canada**, according to law. Changing this would require amending Canada's Constitution. NOTE: **There's usually no need to specify "King of"** in stories about the British monarchy because the prepositional detail is understood. Charles will not only be King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but also the King of Canada and various other Commonwealth countries. Saying King Charles III or King Charles will suffice in most stories, just as it did in news reports about his mother.

**6\. Is it OK to refer to Camilla as the Queen Consort?** Potentially.**Yes. (Confirmed hours after Elizabeth's death.)**
**Camilla is expected to become Queen Consort**, based not only on tradition but [the specific wishes of Queen Elizabeth in a February 2022 public statement](https://www.royal.uk/accession-day-2022) marking the 70th anniversary of her ascension to the throne: "_And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service_.” **HOWEVER, do not refer to the Duchess of Cornwall as Queen Consort until officials have confirmed the wording is accurate.** Even if we verify that this is her new title, **avoid calling her the "new Queen,"** since that implies she is replacing the monarch. Bear in mind, too, that any reference to a Queen other than Elizabeth may be considered jarring or confusing until after the funeral, even in the attributive noun Queen Consort. **One option is to call her Camilla** during this period. Use your judgment. Technically, the British Parliament could pass legislation that imposed specific restrictions about her title. Unless that happens, however, she will likely be crowned Queen Consort with the King at a similar but simpler ceremony. **The tradition is to crown the Queen Consort on the King's coronation day**, although the event can be held later. By convention, the title **Queen Consort can be shortened to Queen alone as long as the context makes her identity as the spouse of the reigning monarch clear** (e.g., Elizabeth's grandmother **Queen Mary** was the Queen Consort of King George V). This is why, for example, stories about the historic, month-long visit to Canada by Elizabeth's parents in 1939 often referred to **the King and Queen** rather than to the King and Queen Consort.

**7\. Does William instantly become Prince of Wales?** **No.**
Prince William does not automatically become Prince of Wales after Charles's ascension. **He is likely to be given that title eventually, as the next in line to the throne, but it is ultimately up to the new monarch.** While the Prince of Wales traditionally becomes King, the title is technically not heritable. **UPDATE: Charles confirmed that William had become the new Prince of Wales the day after the Queen's death. William's wife, Catherine, became the Princess of Wales.** 

**8\. Will the funeral be a national day of mourning?** **Yes.**
**Based on tradition, the sovereign's funeral will be declared a national day of mourning in Canada** and many other parts of the Commonwealth. However, it's not automatically a paid statutory holiday. That normally requires either a proclamation by the federal cabinet or legislation through Parliament. The most likely scenario based on procedural manuals written half a century ago is that Canada's prime minister will publicly express sympathy over the Queen's death as well as the country's support for the new King, followed by an order in council declaring "a national holiday" on the day of the funeral. Flags will be ordered to fly at half-mast on all federal buildings, including the Peace Tower, until sunset of the day of the funeral, and both the House of Commons and the Senate will adjourn for a declared period of mourning. **UPDATE: Less than 48 hours after the Queen's death, the date of her state funeral was announced:** **Monday, Sept. 19, 2022.** **Canada's prime minister declared it both a national day of mourning and a federal holiday, although whether non-federal workers got paid time off varied across the country, depending on the province or territory.**

**9\. Do we get new money right away?** **No.**
**There will be no immediate change to Canada's money.** The Royal Canadian Mint and the Bank of Canada do not have templates in place for coins and paper dollars featuring a different sovereign. Therefore, after Canada's Governor General declares that there is a new “lawful and rightful liege," a plan will be set in motion to gradually produce and introduce money featuring the King. But there's no estimate on how quickly the new money will start to appear, since the reigning monarch must approve whatever portrait is used in the design. Meanwhile, old currency featuring Elizabeth will remain legal tender for many years.

**10\. Will some proper nouns change?** **Yes.**
**Beyond money, there will be a lot of paperwork**, as government officials start slowly changing every dated reference to the Queen and Her Majesty on various documents, including future Canadian passports, which, unless the phrasing is revised, will eventually be issued "in the name of His Majesty the King." The country's royal anthem, God Save the Queen, becomes **God Save the King**. Be aware that **Charles's ascension will automatically affect various institutional names** in Canada — from Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition becoming **His Majesty's Loyal Opposition** in Parliament to the Court of Queen's Bench becoming **the Court of King's Bench** and the Queen's Printer becoming **the King's Printer**. The change in monarchs will not, however, affect other unique proper nouns, such as the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, founded in the early 1880s under Victoria, Elizabeth's great-great grandmother.

### Royal titles

**Royal titles** 

[Camilla](/home/r/royal-titles#camilla) (Queen Consort) 

[Prince William](/home/r/royal-titles#princewilliam) (and Catherine) 

[Prince Harry](/home/r/royal-titles#princeharry) (and Meghan) 

[Other royal families](/home/r/royal-titles#otherroyalfamilies) (e.g., King Albert II of Belgium) 

[Miscellaneous](/home/r/royal-titles#miscellaneous) (Royal vs. royal, sheik, life peerages, etc.)

**Overview**

Use **king and queen** when referring to heads of state. The titles are **capitalized before names. But in generic second references, the nouns are lowercase except for Canada's sovereign and former British monarchs.**

> the King (_Canada's monarch_)
>
> King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden
>
> the king (_foreign monarch_)
>
> Sweden's queen
>
> Victoria became Queen at 18 (_former British monarch_)
>
> Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee (_former British monarch_)


Be aware that **there's a different between ascension to the throne and a coronation**. Both are a part of royal succession. But **the former happens almost immediately** (usually within hours) of the death of a monarch while **the latter conventionally refers to an official "crowning" ceremony** — one that often takes place long after ascension (sometimes more than a year later). This detail is relevant in many ways. It affects everything from calculations about **a monarch's reign** (which **begins at ascension** rather than at coronation) to accurate use of the title queen or king before the official coronation ceremony. It also explains the meaning behind sayings such as, "The Queen is dead. Long live the King." (See our [Crown succession FAQs](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-succession-faqs/ "Royal succession FAQs") published before Elizabeth's death in 2022 for details about various JSP and stylistic considerations after the death of Canada's monarch.)

**Royals rarely use surnames. So when titles have been inherited or bestowed, they’re generally needed to help identify people** (e.g., prince and princess for the children and certain grandchildren of monarchs, duke and duchess for the spouses of some royals). **These titles are not capitalized, however, unless directly before the name** (e.g., Prince Harry is a prince not a Prince) **or as part of a compound title** (e.g., the Prince of Wales arrived early, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent Canada Day in Ottawa).

**Never assume that a spouse holds a matching title** (e.g., Queen Elizabeth's husband, Philip, was a prince and a duke but not a king, and King Charles's second wife, Camilla, was referred to as a duchess not as a princess after their marriage in 2005 when he was still the Prince of Wales). Double-check if you're not sure.

**Limit use of formal titles to keep coverage uncluttered and understandable** (e.g., prefer Princess Beatrice over "Princess Beatrice of York" as long as the context makes it clear she's Prince Andrew's daughter). **Also, leave out royal rankings** (e.g., HIH for Her/His Imperial Highness, HRH for Her/His Royal Highness, HGDH for Her/His Grand Ducal Highness), which are inessential and overly stilted for news stories. While **HRH variations** are sometimes used in place of names (e.g., "their royal highnesses"), especially in live on-air coverage, it's optional. It can also be tricky (e.g., the Duchess of Cambridge is a "royal highness" but the Duchess of York is not). So don't use the term unless you're sure.

**Always keep the best interests of our audience in mind** (e.g., see [Harry vs. Duke of Sussex](/home/r/royal-titles#princeharry) below). **The overriding principles are accuracy and clarity, not blind conformity to abstruse protocol.**

NOTE: The capitalization rules outlined below apply to online journalism. They're based on long-standing publishing conventions. Different style is acceptable in [TV supers and graphics](/home/t/tv_text), however, depending on relevant in-house guidelines.



**King vs. Queen**
**The word king applies only to male monarchs**, not to consorts. So **the husband of a reigning queen is not a king** (e.g., Queen Elizabeth's spouse was Prince Philip).

**The word queen, by contrast, is used in three ways:**

-   **Queen regnant** (the monarch, as in Queen Elizabeth): _Regnant is implied and never used in stories_.
-   **Queen Consort** (wife of the reigning King; capitalized, as in "the Queen Consort died 17 years after King George V"): _While consort can be used it's normally implied_, as in "She's expected to become Queen Catherine when her husband, Prince William, ascends to the throne." See also [other royal families](/home/r/royal-titles#otherroyalfamilies) for use of "queen consort" lowercase.
-   **Queen dowager** (lowercase; mother of the reigning Queen, as in the late Queen Mum — Elizabeth's mother and husband of King George VI): _Dowager is almost never used in stories_ because the person's profile usually makes this narrower meaning of Queen clear.



**King Charles**
**Born: Nov. 14, 1948.** Married Diana Spencer in 1981. They were divorced in 1996. Married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.
**Became monarch in September 2022** after the death of his mother, Elizabeth II.

**In first reference, Canada's current head of state is normally called:**

> **the King**
>
> **King Charles**
>
> **King Charles III** (**\***)
>
> **\*** = The _current Canadian monarch's ordinal designation ("III") is optional but often unnecessary in routine reporting. The roman numerals are usually reserved for highly formal settings, such as coverage of a coronation ceremony, or in cases when there might be confusion with a past historical figure_.

**In second reference:**

> **the King**
>
> **Charles**


The **possessive of Charles is Charles's**, as in **Charles's reign**, **Charles's speech**, **Charles's sons**. It's no harder to say on air than the "bus's engine," a "business's profits," a "witness's testimony," their boss's retirement," "St. James's Palace" or "Mars's orbit." See [s' versus s's](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s/ "S versus s s") for an in-depth look at various rules and conventions tied to possessive apostrophes.


It's **unnecessary to say or write His Majesty**, but if it's spelled out (e.g., in transcribed quotes) the first letters are capitalized.

**Avoid calling him the King of England** (a subsumed title that hasn't been used by a sovereign since 1707). While he is King of the United Kingdom, generally steer clear of that wording. Instead, say or write **King of Canada** if you think such detail is called for in a particular story. This prepositional context is often superfluous, since it's usually implied by the shorter title "the King." In certain cases, however, the longer phrase ("King of Canada") can be helpful to underscore his constitutional role in our parliamentary democracy. For the same reason, use **Royal Family** rather then "British" Royal Family.


**Camilla**
**Born: July 17, 1947.** Became Queen Consort in September 2022.

**In first and subsequent references, Charles's wife can be called:**

> **the Queen Consort** (as in the King and the Queen Consort)
>
> **Camilla** (as in Charles and Camilla)
>
> **Queen Camilla** (**^**) or Queen Consort Camilla
>
> **the Queen** (**^**)
>
> **^** = _**By convention, the title Queen Consort can be shortened to Queen alone as long as the context makes her identity as the spouse of the reigning monarch clear** (e.g., Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary was the Queen Consort of King George V). This is why, for example, stories about the historic, month-long visit to Canada by Elizabeth's parents in 1939 often referred to the King and Queen rather than to the King and Queen Consort. It's also why many British news organizations ran headlines about "King Charles and Queen Camilla" leaving Balmoral Castle the day after Elizabeth's death._



**Prince William (and Catherine)**
**In first reference, Charles's elder son and heir to the throne can be called:**

> **Prince William** (_a title he's had since birth in 1982_)
>
> **the Prince of Wales** (_a title given to him by his father in 2022, the day after Charles became King_)  **\*\***
>
>
> **\*\*** = William has other honours that are largely irrelevant in daily journalism because "Prince of Wales" identifies him instantly. For instance, _William was granted the Duke of Cambridge title on his wedding in 2011, and his father's Duke of Cornwall title was passed to him when Charles became King in 2022. He's also, among other things, the Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus._
>
> **In second reference:**

> **William** (_preferred_)
>
> **the prince** (_rare; keep lowercase when this title is used on its own_)


Although **the clipped form Will** is acceptable in headlines and light features, it's generally a poor choice in routine news coverage because some in our audience perceive it as overly informal (along the lines of calling King Charles "Charlie" or "Chuck"). **Avoid the British shorthand Wills** with an "s." See related guidelines about "Kate" below.

**In first reference and subsequent references, William's wife is called:**

> **Catherine** (_as in William and Catherine_)
>
> **the Princess of Wales**
>
> **Catherine Middleton** (_acceptable convention in some contexts; see below for details_)
>
> **Kate** (OK sometimes, but informal so use sparingly) **\*^\***
>
>
> **\*^\*** \= **For several years, "Kate" was preferred over Catherine**, which she spells with a C not with a K. **After she became the Princess of Wales in the fall of 2022, however, CBC News switched to Catherine as our default** to better reflect the Royal Family's known preference. The BBC and several other British media outlets adopted a similar style. This **does NOT mean that the familiar but breezy diminutive is automatically wrong.** It largely depends on context, a given story's tone, etc. But **Kate is now generally considered a notably informal alternative, along the lines of the occasional use of "Di" for Diana**, the late Princess of Wales. So while it's fine to mention, say, a crowd's chant of "Will and Kate," our usual style is to refer to William and Catherine in stories.

**There is no need to use any of Catherine's other titles**, such as the Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge, or the Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus.

Just as the Duchess of Cornwall was referred to as Camilla Parker Bowles in news stories for several years after her marriage to Charles, **the Princess of Wales is still sometimes called Catherine (or Kate) Middleton** when it's the clearest way to introduce her (e.g., if there's no pertinent reference to Prince William that puts her name, alone, in context). **This is an acceptable convention that helps our audience**.

See also [**Prince and Princess of Wales**](#princeandprincessofwales) below for additional background about the titles.

**William and Catherine's children are:**


> **Prince George** (born in July 2013)
>
> **Princess Charlotte** (born in May 2015)
>
> **Prince Louis** (born in April 2018)

There's **no need to add the prepositional detail "of Wales" after their names** (e.g., **Prince George of Wales**), even though the longer form appears in various official documents.


The **[official line of succession on the Royal Family's website](https://www.royal.uk/succession)** lists 20 heirs, with Prince William first, Prince Harry fifth, Prince Andrew eighth, Prince Edward 13th and Princess Anne 16th.


**Prince Harry (and Meghan)**
**In first reference, Charles's youngest son can be called:**

> **Prince Harry**  (_preferred; virtually no one has called him by his formal name, "Prince Henry," since his birth in 1984_)
>
> **the Duke of Sussex** (_a title granted on his wedding in 2018_)


**There's no need to call him the Duke of Sussex unless the detail is relevant to the story or the title is considered the simplest way to introduce Harry and his wife** (i.e., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex). He has other titles, too, that are irrelevant in daily journalism, including Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.

**In second reference:**

> **Harry** (_preferred_)
>
> **the prince** (_rare; keep lowercase when this title is used on its own_)


**In first and subsequent references, Harry's wife is called:**

> **Meghan** (_as in Harry and Meghan_)
>
> **Meghan Markle** (_acceptable convention in some contexts; see "Catherine Middleton" above for reasoning and details_)
>
> **the Duchess of Sussex**
>
> **the duchess** (_rare; keep lowercase when this title is used on its own_)


**Meghan is not a princess**, so do not call her "Princess Meghan." See [Prince of Wales](/home/r/royal-titles#princeandprincessofwales) below for details about the relatively narrow rules governing the title "princess."


There’s **no need to use her full birth name** (Rachel Meghan Markle) since she’s known as Meghan rather than as Rachel. There's also **no need to use any of Meghan's other titles**, such as Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.

Harry and Meghan's **children are:**


> **Prince Archie** Mountbatten-Windsor (born in May 2019)  **\*\*\***
>
> **Princess Lilibet** Mountbatten-Windsor (born in June 2021)  **\*\*\***
>
> **\*\*\*** = _There's no need to add the prepositional detail "of Sussex" after their names (e.g., Prince Archie of Sussex), even though the longer form appears in various official documents. As grandchildren of a reigning King, the titles prince and princess were expected to be automatically granted to Harry's children when Queen Elizabeth died and Charles ascended to the throne. However, the final decision rested with the new King. In March 2023, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the children would be known as Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet._



**NOTE:** Less than two years after their May 2018 marriage, the couple moved to North America and announced plans to step back from royal duties. **Effective April 1, 2020, they officially stopped representing the Queen at public events, and stopped using their "HRH"** (His/Her Royal Highness) **honorifics.** Their other titles remain in place, however, which means **it's OK to continue to call him Prince Harry, and to use the proper nouns Duke and Duchess of Sussex** to help identify them. In February 2021, Buckingham Palace reaffirmed that the couple would "not be returning as working members of the Royal Family."




**Queen Elizabeth** (1926-2022)
Born: April 21, 1926. **Died: Sept. 8, 2022** at the age of 96.
Married Philip Mountbatten (formerly Prince Philip of Greece) in 1947.
**Became monarch in February 1952** at the age of 25 after the death of her father, George VI.

**In first and subsequent references, Canada's previous head of state is normally called:**

> **the former or the late Queen**
>
> **Queen Elizabeth**

> **Queen Elizabeth II** (**\*\***)
>
> **Elizabeth**
>
>
> **\*\*** = Roman numerals are optional. There's **often no need to identify her as Queen Elizabeth II,** unless the story makes a historical reference to Elizabeth I and the "II" detail helps clarify which monarch you're talking about.


Elizabeth was indisputably the **longest-serving sovereign in British history** (just over **70 years and seven months** on the throne). **Be aware that some historians also argue that she was "effectively" the longest-serving monarch in world history.** That's because Elizabeth assumed the daily duties of Queen the moment her father died in 1952. By contrast, France's Louis XIV was only four when he became that country's sovereign in 1643, which meant that the boy's mother was technically in charge as regent until he turned 13. So while on paper Louis was a monarch for just over 72 years — roughly 20 months longer than Elizabeth — in reality she reigned more than half a decade longer than him.


**Prince Philip** (1921-2021)
Born: June 10, 1921. **Died: April 9, 2021** at the age of 99.

**In first reference, Elizabeth's deceased husband can be called:**

> **Prince Philip** (_a title he was given in 1957_)
>
> **the former or the late Duke of Edinburgh** (_a title he had since his marriage to Elizabeth in 1947_)


**In second reference:**

> **Philip** (_preferred_)
>
> **the late Duke of Edinburgh**
>
> **the duke** (_rare; keep lowercase when this title is used on its own_)


The term Prince Consort (husband of a reigning monarch) is accurate but was virtually never used in Philip's case. Although he was not technically a member of the Royal Family, as narrowly defined by monarchy scholars who traditionally exclude male consorts, it's an accepted convention to refer to him as such without qualification. On the Queen's own website, Philip was described this way in 2013: "Though the Duke of Edinburgh does not appear in the immediate line of succession, he appears directly after the Queen in the order of precedence as he is considered the second most senior member of the Royal Family."



**ALSO DECEASED**

> **the Queen Mum** (Elizabeth's mother: 1900-2002)
>
> **Princess Margaret** (Elizabeth's sister: 1930-2002)




**The rest of the Royal Family**
**In first reference:**

> **Princess Anne** (_acceptable and preferred, even though she's been officially known as **the Princess Royal** since 1987; children are Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall_)
>
> **Prince Andrew** (_children are Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie_), the **Duke of York** (since 1986)
>
> **Prince Edward** (_children are Lady Louise Windsor and James, the Earl of Wessex_), the **Duke of Edinburgh** (since 2023)


**In second reference, first names are sufficient:** Anne, Andrew, Edward.

**Lady Sarah, the Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duchess of York**
The **late Princess Margaret's children** are David Armstrong-Jones, the **Earl of Snowdon**; and **Lady Sarah** Armstrong-Jones.

Princess Edward's wife, **Sophie Rhys-Jones**, has been the **Duchess of Edinburgh** since 2023. Before that, she was known as the Countess of Wessex.

Prince Andrew's ex-wife, **Sarah Ferguson**, is still the **Duchess of York** but should not be referred to as a member of the Royal Family. Prefer Sarah in second reference. Generally avoid the colloquial clipped surname "Fergie," except in light features.

The Royal Family's other members have much lower profiles and are rarely included in Canadian news stories (e.g., the Queen's first cousins, the Duke of Kent and his sister, Princess Alexandra).


**The titles Prince and Princess of Wales**
In the Commonwealth, **the Prince of Wales is the male "heir apparent" to the throne.** Under succession protocol, **if a woman is first in the line to the throne, she is normally known as "heir presumptive"** rather than as the "Princess of Wales" (e.g., until her father's death in 1952, the Queen was Princess Elizabeth and heir presumptive.) In news stories, **the shorter and clearer expression "heir to the throne" is preferred in all contexts.**

The spouse of the male heir to the throne is normally called **the** **Princess of Wales**. But since the title was so closely associated with Diana, Charles's first wife, through the 1980s and 90s, his second wife, Camilla, was known only as the Duchess of Cornwall when he was still the Prince of Wales. **Catherine Middleton became Princess of Wales the day after Charles became King in 2022.**

**"Princess" is properly used before a name only if the woman was given that title at birth** (e.g., Princess Margaret). It's becoming increasingly common, however, to report the courtesy title Princess of Wales this way (e.g., the officially correct title "Diana, Princess of Wales" is often shortened to the late "Princess Diana"). See [Diana](/home/r/royal-titles#diana) below for more details.

If the Prince of Wales has sons or daughters, the children's titles are technically tied to the father's on paper (e.g., Prince George of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales) but not in practice (i.e., we simply refer to Prince George and Princess Charlotte). **Confusion sometimes arises when an heir to the throne's son marries. That's because the official title of the wife counterintuitively features the husband's name** (e.g., Catherine Middleton technically became "Princess William of Wales" upon marriage in 2011). **Such forms are never used in news stories**, however.

See [Prince William and Kate](/home/r/royal-titles#princewilliam) above for related guidelines.


**Diana**
Born Diana Spencer in 1961. Became "Lady Diana" in 1975 when her father, a viscount, inherited the title of earl. Married Charles in 1981 at age 20. Announced separation in 1992. Divorced in 1996. Killed in a car crash in Paris with companion Dodi Fayed on Aug. 31, 1997, at age 36. Mother of Princes William and Harry.

**In first reference, prefer constructions such as:**

> **Diana, the former Princess of Wales**
>
> **the late Princess Diana** (_see usage note below about accepted convention_)
>
> **the late Lady Diana**
>
> **Diana** (_Her name is iconic and normally understood on its own_)


**Second references can include:**

> **Diana**
>
> **Lady Di, Princess Di** (_also fine in headlines_)
>
> **the former Princess of Wales**


She is commonly remembered as "Princess Diana" or "Princess Di" based on popular but incorrect rewording of the title she held while married to Charles (as outlined in [Prince and Princess of Wales](/home/r/royal-titles#princeandprincessofwales) above). **Diana was not actually a princess** — a style point closely enforced for several years after her divorce. **Since her death, however, the compounds Princess Diana and Princess Di have become the norm.** Given that the actual historical reference is correct (she is primarily remembered for her time as the Princess of Wales), **it's OK to use the form Princess Diana, especially when space is at a premium** (e.g., in a headline or lead). But avoid generic references to her as "a princess" in stories.


**House of Windsor vs. Mountbatten-Windsor**
**Windsor is the former Queen's family name, as well as the name of King Charles** **and his sons. The rest of Elizabeth's children**, and all their descendants not in line to the throne, **have a hyphenated last name: Mountbatten-Windsor.
**
**Royalty rarely use surnames, however, so this is not normally a concern in news stories.** It's perfectly acceptable to talk about **the House of Windsor** and **the Windsors** when reporting on **the Royal Family** in general

The Duke of Windsor was the title given to Elizabeth's uncle, King Edward VIII, after his abdication in 1936.


**Other royal families**
**Use capital letters only for the Canadian sovereign's family: the Royal Family.** All other royal families are lowercase (e.g., Sweden's **royal family**, the Danish **royal family**).

**The titles king, queen, prince and princess are capitalized only in front of the names of living members of foreign royal families** (e.g., King Albert II of Belgium but Belgium's king; Queen Sofia of Spain but the king and queen of Spain, Spain's queen consort; the former queen Astrid of Belgium).

**Full names are optional in first reference** (e.g., Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Bin-Abd-al-Aziz Al Saud). **But generally prefer a shorter version** (King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia) **unless there's an editorial reason for the longer proper noun** (e.g., possible confusion with someone else in the story, such as a monarch's recently deceased parent).

**Keep in mind that the head of a royal family may not actually be a king or queen** (e.g., the Grand Duke Henri Guillaume of Luxembourg and Prince Albert of Monaco).


**Miscellaneous (Royal vs. royal, Sheik, life peerages, etc.)**
**The word royal is virtually always lowercase** (_royal assent, royal proclamation, royal residences, royal salute, royal tour, royal wedding, royalty_) **unless part of a proper noun** (_Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Ontario Museum, Royal Newfoundland Constabulary_). **The primary exception is Royal Family**, applied only to Canada's (the Commonwealth's) monarch as outlined above. See also [royal commissions](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/royal-commissions/ "Royal commissions").

**When applicable, generally include roman numerals in first references to monarchs unless they are Canada's current head of state** (_King Abdullah II of Jordan_) **unless space is tight** (e.g., in headlines). **Use the name alone in second reference** (_King Abdullah or Abdullah_). See also [King Charles III](/home/r/royal-titles#kingcharles) above for related convention.

**Ordinals are not normally used for other titles unless the detail helps our audience** understand the story better (e.g., Diana's brother Charles can be called the _Earl Spencer_ rather than _the 9th Early Spencer_ as long as overall context makes his identity clear).

**Drop supplementary honorifics such as Sheik before names if a primary title has already been used** (e.g., _King Hamad of Bahrain_; second reference _King Hamad_ or _Hamad_ but not "_Sheik Hamad_").

**Avoid superfluous titles unless there's obvious editorial merit.** For example, before Charles became the King in 2022, there was generally no need to refer to him as the Duke of Cornwall, a title he'd held since the age of 4. The most common exceptions were when the detail was relevant to a given story, or when it was considered the simplest way to introduce Charles and his wife (i.e., the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall). Dukedom is the highest rank in British peerage.

**Don't stuff stories with formal titles** (e.g., marquess and marchioness, viscount and viscountess). **Instead, prefer simpler language** — as long as its accurate and clear (e.g., _Lord Bristol_ or _Lady Bathrather_ than _Marquess of Bristol_ and the _Marchioness of Bath_).

**Life peerages** (titles that are not hereditary) **should be used only if relevant to the story.** The most common life peerage granted by the Crown is baron. In these cases, type in the full title: **Lord Black of Crossharbour (Lord Black** in second reference). Otherwise, stick to the name that's more familiar (**Conrad Black**).

**Generally avoid knighthood-related honorifics "Sir" and "Dame"** (e.g. Alfred Hitchcock, not "Sir Alfred Hitchcock," Elizabeth Taylor, not "Dame Elizabeth") **unless referring to historical figures whose titles have become entrenched over time** (e.g., Sir John A. Macdonald). These chivalry addresses are not actually peerages. See [honorary titles](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/titles/#honorary "Titles") for more details.

**Constitutional monarchs reign** rather than rule. Do not confuse [reign and rein.](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/reign-versus-rein/ "Reign versus rein")

### rugby

**Rugby terms**

centre, fly half, flying winger, fullback, goal line (two words), halftime, inside centre, lineout, number 8 position (_specific team role_), offside, outside centre, right flank, scrum half, Test match (_uppercase T, lowercase m_), try, tries

The sport rugby sevens (lowercase) should be written as rugby 7s (no apostrophe) in headlines to save space. Since it's not a widely known noun, it should be briefly defined in stories. For example: "Rugby sevens is designed to be faster-paced than the traditional version of the sport. Each team fields seven players instead of 15."

See the [sports overview](/home/s/sports-overview) for links to various other entries, including baseball, basketball, curling, football, golf, hockey, soccer and Olympics.

### Russian names

**Russian names**

**Names converted from Cyrillic to Latin characters are sometimes wildly different**, depending on the approach taken by the person you're identifying. **Follow an individual's preference**.

For instance, if "x" has been chosen instead of "ks," it would be _Alexander_ instead of the more common Russian version, _Aleksandr_.)

**Although some conversions are standard** (ov and ev, not off or eff), **retain traditional spellings of names that have become entrenched through usage:**

> Alexander Solzhenitsyn (not _Aleksandr_)
>
> czar (not _tsar_)
>
> Khrushchev (not _Khrushchyov_)
>
> Peter the Great (not _Pyotr_)
>
> Rachmaninoff (not _Rakhmaninov_)
>
> Tchaikovsky (not _Chaikovsky_)

**If a person's preference is not known, do _not_ make up your own spellings.** For further guidance, see [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations).


**Kyiv, Chornobyl, etc.**
**Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, many Russian transliterations have been replaced** by different spellings that more closely represent local languages now used in the former Soviet republics. **For instance, we write Kyiv** (not _Kiev_), **Chornobyl** (not _Chernobyl_) and **Odesa** (not _Odessa_) because these combinations of letters better reflect the [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names).

NOTE: **Our main source for the spellings of communities outside of Canada is the National Geographic Atlas of the World.** But there are exceptions (e.g., Kabul not "_Kabol_," Damascus not "_Dimashq_," and Rome not "_Roma_"). So always check the CBC Language Guide first.

**Saint John** (but [**St. John River**](/home/s/st-saint-ste#StJohnRiver) because it's become entrenched through local use in New Brunswick). The name of the largest city in New Brunswick doesn't need to be followed by the abbreviation N.B. But don't call it the province's capital, which is Fredericton. And be sure to spell Saint John correctly. Do not confuse it with the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. John's. See also [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities)

**St. John Ambulance** (_not_ John's)

**St. John's** (The name of the capital city of [Newfoundland and Labrador](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador) doesn't need to be followed by the abbreviation [N.L.](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador) But be sure to spell it correctly. Do not confuse with New Brunswick's largest city, Saint John.) See also [St., Saint, St-, Sainte, Ste-](/home/s/st-saint-ste) and [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities)

**St-Laurent, Louis Stephen** (1882-1973) Use the spelling Louis St-Laurent not "Saint-Laurent" or "St. Laurent" (See also [St., Saint, St-, Sainte, Ste-](/home/s/st-saint-ste))

**St. Lawrence, Gulf ofSt. Lawrence RiverSt. Lawrence Seaway, the seaway, St. Lawrence Seaway Authority**

**St. Martin** (French side of Caribbean island), **St. Maarten** (Dutch side of Caribbean island) **St.** is abbreviated in both cases. No Hyphen. Collectively, it's **generally OK to refer to St. Martin alone when we mean the entire island** (e.g., in hurricane coverage). But avoid implying that it's a single territory by adding descriptive detail whenever possible, such as the "**French and Dutch sides of St. Martin**." There is no need to adopt the long and awkward proper noun, "St. Martin/St. Maarten." On the other hand, do not rely solely on the name "St. Martin" when specifically referring to "St. Maarten." Instead, add a qualifying description such as "the Dutch side of St. Martin." In stories focused on only one of the territories, it can be simpler to use applicable spellings to identify the location (e.g., "Canada's consulate in St. Maarten" rather than "Canada's consulate on the Dutch side of St. Martin"). In either case, stick with "St." **Avoid adopting foreign variations, such as the Dutch word "Sint,"** for the same reason we write "Cape" instead of the Portuguese word "Cabo" in Cape Verde. (See [country names](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld))

**St. Paul** (Minn.)  Although it's the capital of Minnesota, we generally add the state abbreviation after the name in first reference to aid our audience. St. Paul is the smaller half of the **Twin Cities** of [**Minneapolis-St. Paul**](/home/m#Minneapolis)

**St. Petersburg** (formerly Leningrad)

**St-Pierre-Miquelon** (France's eight small islands off Newfoundland's southern coast) It's common and **generally easiest to treat this name as a fused compound with hyphens and no conjunction** (St-Pierre-Miquelon), especially on the web. This is also CP style, which means St-Pierre-Miquelon is common in wire copy. It's OK to add either "et" (**St-Pierre-et-Miquelon**) or to use the more conversational English form (**Saint Pierre and Miquelon**, without hyphens), especially in broadcast scripts. "St" traditionally becomes "Saint" when the English conjunction "and" is added. Generally **stick to one spelling within any given story**. These are **all entrenched and acceptable short forms** for the archipelago (officially referred to as _La collectivité d'outre-mer de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon_, translated as France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon). It's unnecessary to use the full, formal proper noun. (See also [country names](/home/g/geography-cities) for general guidelines about common geographical names)

**St. Valentine's Day** or **Valentine's Day** (Feb. 14), _but_ **a valentine** (card, gift, etc.)

**Saamis Teepee** (in Medicine Hat, Alta.) Use this spelling for consistency. Tourism officials sometimes refer to the gigantic steel structure as the "Saamis Tepee." But it's a common convention to prefer in-house spellings of generic words in such nouns.

**Sabbath** (capitalized for religious contexts, as in the Sabbath); otherwise **sabbath** (lowercase), as in a [**digital sabbath**](/home/d#digital_sabbath) (See [holidays](/home/h/holidays))

**sabbatical** (lowercase) A break from a job, activity, etc., as in a teaching sabbatical

**Saint Pierre and Miquelon** (see [**St-Pierre-Miquelon**](/home/s#St-Pierre-Miquelon))

**salability, salable** (_not_ -eable)

**salchow, triple salchow** (lowercase) This figure-skating jump, named after a Swedish world champion, was capitalized for many years. It's now lowercase, however, because of common usage. See also [axel](/home/a#axel) and [lutz](/home/l#lutz), as well as [figure skating versus figure-skating](/home/s#skating)

**Salih, Barham** (elected president of Iraq in the fall of 2018) **Salih** in second reference. [Titles](/home/t/titles) such as president are uppercase only when directly in front of the current office holder (i.e., **Iraq President Barham Salih**). Prefer the spelling Salih over alternative [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), such as "Saleh." His official English social media accounts use "Salih."

**Salish Sea** A large area of coastal waters between Vancouver Island, mainland British Columbia and Washington State [was officially named the Salish Sea](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-waters-officially-renamed-salish-sea-1.909504) by Coast Salish and government leaders in 2010. The Salish Sea includes Puget Sound, the Juan de Fuca Strait and the Strait of Georgia; the original names for those three areas have been retained, but Salish Sea refers to the entire body of water.

**saviour**, but **Saviour** (Christ)

**savour, savoury** (flavour); but **savory** (type of herb)

**say, says, said** (a common and highly recommended verb for attribution) "Say" is sometimes undervalued. It's well tailored to journalism because it's short, neutral and unobtrusive. See [say vs. admit, claim, concede, etc.](/home/s/say)

**scalp** (v.) An acceptable way to describe the reselling of tickets, normally at inflated prices. People who engage in **ticket scalping** are called **scalpers**. These terms have been widely used in North America since the 1800s. They're instantly understood and, so, preferred over bureaucratic-sounding synonyms (e.g., "ticket speculation"). The verb scalp is also neutral. In the context of ticket sales, it refers to one person exploiting another by taking a significant profit (cut off the top), and is unrelated to the act of skinning conquered enemies' heads. Worth noting: Historians say warriors in Europe and other parts of the world engaged in battlefield scalping over the centuries. So when writing about this different, barbaric meaning of scalping, it's inaccurate to imply that the practice is linked solely to Indigenous people in North America.

**[scandal](/home/s/scandal)** (avoid misuse/overuse)

**scare, scary, scarier**

**schizophrenia** (A mental illness. Its symptoms vary, but can include confusion, delusion and paranoia.)**Limit the use of schizophrenia to its medical meaning** of a psychosis. Do not toss it around as a fancy description for someone who is merely inconsistent, undecided, etc. See also [schizophrenic](/home/d/disability-language#schizophrenic) for an important editorial caveat about ways to avoid reducing people to labels.

**Screech** (a type of Newfoundland and Labrador rum)

**screengrab, screenplay, screenshot, screenwriter** (fused), but **screen door, screen saver, screen test** (two words) NOTE: The noun **screenshot** refers to a computer screen. The noun **screened shot**, sometimes shortened to "screen shot," refers to a goalie's obstructed view in hockey.

**Scripture** (traditionally capitalized when referring to specific sections of the Bible);

**scripture, scriptures** (lowercase for generic references to sacred writing, as in Jewish and Christina scripture, Islamic scripture, etc.)

**scuttlebutt** (no hyphen)

**sea can** (two words) Colloquial and relatively obscure term for "sea canister." Generally reserve for directly transcribed quotes. Otherwise, prefer common descriptions such as **large shipping crate, marine freight container**, etc. Be aware that there are several spellings of the clipped noun (e.g., fused, hyphenated, "C" instead of sea). If used, stick with sea can for consistency. Few compounds involving the word "sea" are hyphenated, and many of them are evolving (e.g., "sea-chest" is now "sea chest"). Proper nouns are exceptions (e.g., the Alberta-based company **Sea-Can Containers**).

**Sea-Doo** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a personal watercraft brand)

**Seafarers International Union of Canada** (no apostrophe); **SIU** is fine in second reference

**season's greetings seatbelt** (one word)

**Sea-to-Sky Highway** (hyphens) The name of a section of British Columbia's Highway 99 from Vancouver to Pemberton, B.C., near Whistler.

**seaway, St. Lawrence Seaway, St. Lawrence Seaway Authority**

**second lieutenant** (**2nd Lt.**) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**Second World War** (_preferred_ over World War II, unless [WW II](/home/w#WW1WW2) has been used in the headline) See also [numbers](/home/n/numbers)

**secretary general** (no hyphen) See [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix)

**Section 9** and **Section 27** or **Sec. 9** and **Sec. 27** (Use an uppercase "S" whether the word is abbreviated or not)

security barrier (_avoid_ the adjective "security" when referring to Israel's structure in the West Bank). See [**barrier**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#barrier) in the Middle East glossary for details and related guidelines. **Security Council (UN)** See [United Nations](/home/u/united-nations)

**Seeing Eye** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for guide dog)

**seizure, seizures** (the preferred word to describe the convulsions or blackouts that people with epilepsy have; avoid colloquialisms such as "fits" and "spells") See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#epilepsy)

**selfie, selfies** (self-portrait, often photographed with a smartphone or other mobile device and uploaded to [social media](/home/s#socialmedia) sites such as Facebook, Flickr or X, formerly known as Twitter) The term selfie has been around since at least 2002, although it didn't become popular until years later. The word is now common enough that it doesn't require a definition, as long as the meaning is clear by the story's context. There's also no need for quotation marks, even in web headlines.

**sell-off** (n.), as in "The sell-off continued Tuesday." When sell is a verb, there's no hyphen (e.g., "They will sell off the rest of the stocks"). But the preposition "off" is often redundant in such cases (i.e., "They will sell the rest of the stocks").

**sellout** (n. and adj.), as in "It was another sellout" and "The sellout crowd cheered wildly." When sell is a verb, the words are not fused (e.g., "The band is expected to sell out the stadium").

**semi (as a prefix)**
semi-annual, semi-automatic, semicircle, semicolon, semi-conscious, semi-detached, semifinal, semifinalist, semi-formal, semigloss, semi-official, semi-sweet, semitone, semi-trailer, semitransparent, semitropical, semi-weekly
  See also [pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D26062&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0MDFJNOVLso4gL5HHuXXuk).

**semi-trailer** or **tractor-trailer** (but _never_ semi-tractor-trailer). The abbreviated form **semi** is fine in second reference to these trucks.

**Semitic, Semitism, Semite** versus **[antisemitic, antisemitism, antisemite](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#antisemitic)**

**Senate**
Use uppercase **Senate** for a national legislature, but **California's senate**, a **university senate**, etc. (See [legislative bodies](/home/l/legislative-bodies)) Generally _avoid_ the terms **upper chamber** and **upper house** for the Canadian Senate because they can be confusing when juxtaposed against [the House](/home/h/house) (the conventional label for the House of Commons). **Red Chamber** is OK as a widely understood colloquialism, but see [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames#caution) for editorial caution about overuse. Use abbreviation **Sen.** directly before the names of current members of Canada's Senate or the U.S. Senate: **Sen. Joyce Fairbairn**, but "Fairbairn has been a **senator** since 1984." (See also [titles](/home/t/titles) for general guidelines). While some party affiliations have become less clear in Canada's Senate over the years, generally follow the choice of individual members, themselves. This includes continued use of the word Liberal, regardless of whether senators belong to a specific parliamentary caucus (e.g., **[Liberal Sen.](/home/l/liberal-senator) George Baker**). Reserve the term "[Independent](/home/i#Independent)" for senators who no longer have ties to any political party. Canadian senators are picked by the prime minister. The choice may be partisan or non-partisan. Although senators are technically appointed by the [Governor General](/home/g/governor-general), the selection is always based on the PM's wishes. So while it's constitutionally inaccurate to say the prime minister _appoints_ senators, it's equally misleading to say the Governor General appoints them without putting that verb in context. It's usually simplest to report that the PM has _named_ new senators, or _picked_ new senators, etc. But in debates over Senate reform, it's conventional to link the PM directly to terms such as _senate appointments_. (See also [Congress](/home/c/congress) for related guidelines on U.S. Senate)

**senility** (See [dementia versus senility](/home/d/dementia))

**seniors' residence** (generally implies a nursing home, although it can mean an apartment building or condo building specifically for seniors paying to receive various levels of care); **seniors' home** (See also [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for related guidelines, such as _musicians' instruments_ but _farmers market_)

**sensual** (implies carnal delights, especially sexual pleasure); **sensuous** (appealing to the senses, especially through beauty)

**separate** (_not_ seper-) **separate school, separate school board,** etc.

**separatist** (-ar _not_ -er) See [**separatist and sovereigntist**](/home/s/separatist-sovereigntist)

**Sept. 11 attacks, Sept. 11** (adding "2001" is optional, but requires a comma — **the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks** — to conform to our [dates](/home/a/abbreviations#dates) style) **9/11** is fine in headlines, but use an oblique stroke,**/**, not a hyphen. The [phone number 911](/home/p/phone-numbers), by contrast, is written without a slash, hyphen or other punctuation. Do not spell out September in full unless in a proper noun (e.g., the **National September 11 Memorial and Museum**, also known as the 9/11 Memorial and Museum). See [Ground Zero](/home/g#GroundZero). **Do not refer to the Sept. 11 attacks as** [terrorist attacks](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism). The hijackings led to passenger jet crashes in Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and Manhattan. The World Trade Center (WTC in second reference) was destroyed. (The [September 11 Digital Archive](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F911digitalarchive.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2gC2NQwvVNurM21GNrPX6G) is an excellent resource for details about the attacks. It was created by several U.S. universities, historical societies and foundations.)

**sergeant** (Sgt.), **staff sergeant** (Staff Sgt.), **sergeant major** (Sgt. Maj.), etc. For details on using abbreviations, see [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks) as well as [police ranks](/home/p/police-ranks)

**sergeant-at-arms** (the person who carries the ceremonial sceptre, known as the mace, in and out of the House of Commons), **sergeants-at-arms** (plural)

**serial killer** (avoid misleading or inaccurate usage) There's no universally accepted definition. The obvious criterion is that the person be accused of a series of killings. While two homicides technically qualifies, the term **serial killing normally suggests three or more murders by the same suspect or suspects on different dates**. The time lag is important. Killing a dozen people at once is [mass murder](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/homicide/#mass-murder "Homicide") rather than serial killing.) Avoid sensationalizing crime stories. If someone is charged with killing two hitchhikers over three years, reporting the facts rather than reaching for a label such as "serial killer" is the best way to serve our audience.

**serial rapist** (A key caveat outlined in [serial killer](/home/s#serialkiller) above applies: There must be a series of rapes over time. Whether the term is appropriate requires editorial judgment.) See also [rape versus sexual assault](/home/r/rape-versus-sexual-assault) for important, related guidelines.

**series** (usually lowercase, as in "World Cup series), but **the World Series** (baseball championship) also known as **the Series** in second reference

**set up** (v.), **setup** (n.)

**settlements** (See [settlement versus housing](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#settlement) in the Middle East glossary for specific guidelines on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict)

**Seventh-day Adventist 7Up** (soft drink) Although the beverage's label has a figure and no hyphen, the number is spelled out in the company's name (Seven-Up)

**severe acute respiratory syndrome** ([**SARS**](/home/s/sars) is fine in first reference)

**sewage** (waste); **sewerage** (a drainage system, _but avoid term_ except in transcribed quotes)

**_Sex and the City_** (the name of the TV show was _"and the"_ not _"in the"_) See [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) for relevant guidelines about program titles

**sex ed** (n.), an acceptable but less common noun than the full term **sex education**; **sex-ed** (adj.), an acceptable and very common adjective, as in **sex-ed courses, sex-ed videos,** etc. (See also [phys ed versus phys-ed](/home/p#physed))

**sex-trade worker** (see [**prostitute**](/home/p/prostitute))

**sh (not sch-)
****Use _sh_ not _sch_ at the start of many common Yiddish terms:** shemozzle, shlemiel, shlep, shlock, shmaltz, shmo, shmooz, shnook, shtick; (_Avoid_ "Shmuck," which is based on the word for "penis")

**Shad** (national charity); the **Shad program**; **Shad students** (capital S only; avoid all-uppercase renderings) Shad is an Ontario-based organization that places high school students into month-long summer courses at participating universities across the country. Previously known as the Shad Valley program. "Shad" comes from the name of a creek in Aurora, Ont., where the first program was held in the early 1980s. Since the letters are not an abbreviation, they should not be put in all-caps. Although the charity now prefers "SHAD," we don't adopt this type of whimsical all-uppercase or all-lowercase typography — often rooted in marketing, and which can change overnight. (See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization), such as Visa instead of VISA, and [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms) for related guidelines)

**shadow cabinet, shadow minister** (see [titles](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/titles/#shadow-minister "Titles") for editorial caution)

**shaming** (participle), as in **online shaming**. While the term "shaming" sometimes refers to exposure of socially unacceptable attitudes or behaviour (e.g., shining a light on bullying), be aware that the word can also convey a sense of malicious or vengeful vigilantism (i.e., that the "shaming" itself can refer to a form of bullying). No hyphen is required in "online shaming" because the modifier describes a method of criticism rather than a topic. By contrast, prefer hyphens in compounds that convey a single idea, as in **body-shaming, fat-shaming, [slut-shaming](/home/s#slut-shaming)**. This typographical style is based on convention and ease of comprehension (e.g., **online shaming** but **online body-shaming**). Guard against overuse of the word shaming, especially in uncommon or awkward coinages  (e.g., "grammar-shaming" and "salary-shaming").

**shanghai** (v.), **shanghaied, shanghaiing Shangri-La**

**shanty, shanties, shantytown** (See [**slum, ghetto, shantytown**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown) for detailed guidelines)

**Sharm el-Sheikh** (resort city in Egypt) Generally use the full name throughout stories.

See [Arabic names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/asian-names/ "Asian names") for general transliteration guidelines.

**Shebaa Farms** (avoid alternative English spellings such as Chebaa and Shaba) This is the name of a strip of disputed territory where the Lebanese, Syrian and Israeli borders meet. Israel controls the land, which it insists was captured from Syria in 1967. But Lebanon and Syria say that it's Lebanese territory and must be returned. The 14 farms are named after the village of Shebaa, on the western slopes of Mount Hermon.

**sheik** (_not_ shiek)

**shemozzle** (commotion)

**sheriff**, but **Sheriff** as title immediately before name (Sheriff Andy Taylor)

**Shia** (preferred adjective and noun), **Shias** (plural), **Shias'** (plural possessive) Although Shiite is a common term, follow CBC's preference for Shia in all cases, including **Shia Muslim**. This is also the BBC's approach. _Limit the use of Shiite to transcribed quotes_. (See also [Islam](/home/i/islam) for general guidelines)

**shimmy, shimmying, shimmied** (swaying, shaking, vibrating) Do not confuse with shinny (below)

**shine, shone** (but **shined** is acceptable), **shining** (refers to brightness, brilliance, radiance, as in "shining a light"); Do not confuse with **shin, shinny, shinnying** (preferred over "shinning"), **shinnied** (a specific form of climbing, clambering, scrambling, as in "shinnying up a tree")

**Silicon Valley**

**silo, silos**

May require explanation for the audience (e.g. “The RCMP has issued a Silver Alert, a notification system used to quickly spread information about missing adults who are considered especially vulnerable” or something to that effect).

**Simon, Mary** (appointed Governor General in the summer of 2021) Use **Simon** in second reference. NOTE: Originally, journalists were encouraged to report her full name (Mary May Simon), with May Simon (no hyphen) in second reference. However, Rideau Hall issued a clarification in November 2021 declaring her preference outside of formal constitutional documents to be Mary Simon (second reference Simon). See also [governor general](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/g/governor-general/ "Governor general") overview for related guidelines on Gov. Gen. abbreviation, capitalization, etc.

**singalong** (n., adj.), as in, "They held a singalong." But **sing along** (two words) when sing is a verb, as in, "They all began to sing along."

**Siniora, Fouad** (Lebanese prime minister) At least four different English spellings were widely used in the media during the summer of 2006. Our preference is based on the [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) used by [Lebanon's embassy in Ottawa](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lebanonembassy.ca%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3DZRZDbHJAtQhZoQ3ClDPr).

Be sure to clearly define in stories. Use wording such as "known as" or "referred to as" the Sixties Scoop instead of the editorially problematic label "[so-called](/home/s/so-called)."

**sizable** (not -eable)

**\-size** (prefer "ze" over "zed" in "-size" compounds), as in **full-size** vehicle, **Olympic-size** pool, **pint-size** trick-or-treaters, **golf ball-size** hail, P**ing-Pong ball-size** fruit, etc.

**skating**
**figure skater, figure skating, figure-skating jump; ice skater, ice skating, ice-skating equipment; speed skater,** **speed skating**, **short-track speed skating, long-track speed skating, speed-skating oval, speed-skating champion** (See also [axel](/home/a#axel), [lutz](/home/l#lutz) and [salchow](/home/s#salchow)) **NOTE**: In 2018, we reverted from the fused spellings "speedskater" and "speedskating" to our previous style, speed skater and speed skating, in order to better reflect usage at national and international competitions, including the Olympics. While some North American news organizations, such as CP and AP, continue to use the fused forms, this is no longer CBC style.

**skeptic, skeptical, skepticism** (_not_ sc-)

**ski, skier, skis, skiing**

**sky**
**sky gazers** (two words, no hyphen), **skydiving** (_but_ parachute jumping), **skylight, skyline, skyscraper, skyward, skywatcher, skywriting**

**slash** (**/**) Do not confuse with a backslash (\\), which is rare punctuation used in some computer programming. A slash (/) is a forward-sloping diagonal line, also known as a solidus. In addition to appearing in a lot of internet addresses ([URLs](/home/u/urls)), slashes are used in ratios ([km/h](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout)), fractions ([6/49](/home/l#Lotto)) and various other terms established by convention, such as the historic date [9/11](/home/s#Sept11) and "either/or" constructions. There's no need to say "forward" slash on air. The left-to-right lean is implied.

**slaughter** (n. and verb) Commonly refers to the killing of animals for food. Use with caution when applied to the murder of humans (see [massacre](/home/m#massacre) for details),

**slaughterhouse**

**slide (as a suffix)
****landslide, mudslide, waterslide**; but **mountain slide, rock slide** (two words)

[**slogans**](/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks#slogans) (generally use quotation marks and initial caps on principal words: "America First")

**Slovyansk** (_"y"_ not _"i"_) See [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names)

**slum** (See [**slum, ghetto, shantytown**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown) for various guidelines, including use of the terms **slum landlord** and **slum-like**)

**slut-shaming** (hyphen) To refer to someone's appearance, behaviour, etc., as promiscuous rather than merely as sexually active. The derogatory word "slut" is generally considered sexist because it's normally applied to women only (e.g., a sexually active man might be called a "Casanova" while a sexually active woman is unfairly and hypocritically deemed a "slut"). See [**shaming**](/home/s#shaming) above for related guidelines (e.g., online fat-shaming)

**small-c conservative** (_not_ "small-c Conservative"); small-l liberal (_not_ "small-l Liberal")

**smallmouth** (bass) See also [animals](/home/a/animals) for general guidelines on capitalization

**smartphone** (one word) This is a generic term for mobile phones with advanced features that perform some of the tasks of portable computers, from sending and receiving emails, photos, video, etc., to browsing the web, running various software, sorting data, etc. There is no industry standard defining the basic capabilities of smartphones.

**Smith, Ernest (Smokey)** Canadian war hero who died in August 2005 at the age of 91. (See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames))

**Smithsonian Institution** (not Institute)

**smoky** (_not_ smokey), but **Smokey Bear** (never Smokey _the_ Bear) because this is a proper noun (See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames))

**smorgasbord**

**smoulder** (not smolder)

**SMS** (stands for "short message service") Prefer the more familiar term "**text message**"

**snafu** (a glitch or blunder; a muddled state) Originally, an abbreviation for "**situation normal, all f--ked up,**" according to most dictionaries. The term is believed to have been coined by the U.S. military during the Second World War. Since then, however, the Canadian Oxford points out that "fu" has also come to mean "fouled up." Snafu is an acceptable word in our journalism, especially to describe a series of problems (e.g., frequent subway shutdowns) rather than merely one-time snags. The shorthand form is considered sufficiently censored. See [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language) for related guidelines, including how to handle similar abbreviations.

**sneak, sneaked** (also **snuck**) For years, the preferred past tense and past participle of sneak was sneaked: _He sneaked past the guard. They have sneaked into several movies._ But snuck, which has been around since the late 1800s, has become more common in speech and is now widely accepted. Either form is OK in our journalism. Since snuck is more conversational, it's often preferred: _He snuck past the guard. They have snuck into several movies._

**snow (one word)
**snowball, snowbank, snowblower, snowboard, snowbound, snowcap, snowdrift, snowfall, snowflake, snowman, snowmobile, snowplow, snowshoe, snowshoer, snowstorm (See also [weather words](/home/w/weather-words) for terms like "blizzard" and "flurry")

**snow (two words)
**snow boot, snow clearing (but snow-clearing budget), snow cone, snow fence, snow flurry, snow flurries, snow removal, snow removing, snow shovel, snow shovelling, (but snow-shovelling equipment), snow tire

HINT: Participles such as **snowblowing** and **snowplowing** are one word because they're based on fused nouns (**snowblower, snowplow**), while **snow clearing, snow removing** and **snow shovelling** are two words. (See also [**rain/snow**](/home/w/weather-words#rain) for related guidelines on measuring snow in centimetres versus millimetres.)

**snowboard cross** (although some media outlets fuse all three words, our spelling of this sport includes a space between _snowboard_ and _cross_) "Canada's snowboard cross team," etc.

**snow-packed** (road), **snow-making** (machine)

**Snowbirds** (Canadian Forces aerobatics team), a Snowbirds pilot, a Snowbirds jet; **snowbirds** (retired Canadians who spend their winters in the South)

**snuck** (acceptable as past tense or past participle of sneak) See [sneak](/home/s#sneak) above

**SOB** (well-known insult; does not need to be spelled out as "son of a bitch") Requires no censorship. See [offensive language](/home/o/offensive-language) for related guidelines. Prefer SOB (no periods) to s.o.b., along the lines of VIPs and FAQs. The plural is **SOBs** ("sons of a bitch"). See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for related punctuation guidelines.

**sober** (_but_ sombre)

**Sobeys Inc.** (the company); a **Sobeys store** (no hyphen)

[**so-called**](/home/s/so-called) (use this adjective with care)

**Social Credit party; Social Crediter** (_not_ -or); **Socred** (n. and adj.)

**social distancing** (prefer **physical distancing**) The term "social distancing" was initially used by the World Health Organization and other medical authorities during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/home/c/coronavirus#novelcoronavirus) in early 2020. The synonym "physical distancing" was later recommended, however, because it better conveyed the same meaning: Stay away from other people to avoid getting ill or spreading the infection. In today's internet age, it's possible to keep one's distance from family and friends while remaining socially connected via technology. Furthermore, experts say it's beneficial to maintain contact with others by text, voice and/or video communications during quarantine periods. So while the expression "social distancing" remains relatively common, generally prefer alternatives like "physical distancing" when covering outbreaks. Plain, descriptive language is another option (e.g., "stay home as much as possible" and "keep at least two metres away from others when you go outside").

**social media** (interactive platforms for sharing photos, videos, audio or text) The term commonly refers to websites and digital services such as YouTube, Facebook, Flickr and X, formerly known as [Twitter](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/#Twitter "T"). The compound social media is now so widely used, it no longer requires a definition in news stories. (For editorial direction, see [Use of Social Media](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fuse-of-social-media-medias-sociaux-1.4523590&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1zXH-yM-1HqHysoCF1JkEe) in the CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices policies, as well as the corporation's 2017 [Social Media Guidance](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.radio-canada.ca%2F_files%2Fcbcrc%2Fdocuments%2Fpolicies%2Fsocial-media-guidance-oct-2017-en.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3EeeSXN-KQf88AQnt64YME) handout for all employees)

**Sofia, Bulgaria** (not "Sofiya," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**soft-spoken** (hyphen)

**software**

**SOGI** (**sexual orientation and gender identity**) If used in stories, spell out in first reference. Since the shorthand remains unfamiliar to many, it can be confusing if included in directly transcribed quotes, an organization's name, etc., without being defined or explained.

**Soleimani, Qassem** (Iranian general killed by U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020) For consistency, use this spelling instead of alternative [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), such as "Qasem" or "Qassim." Soleimani had been one of Iran's top military commanders, as well as the architect of Tehran’s proxy wars in the Middle East. At the time of his death, he was head of the Quds Force — an elite unit within Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The Quds Force is listed as a terrorist organization by several governments, including Canada and the U.S.

**solo, solos**

**soluble**

**Somalia** (East African country), **Somali** (traditional n. and adj.), as in a _Somali delegation, Somali refugees, Somali pirates, several Somalis., the Somali Canadian Association._ **Somalian** is a less common but acceptable adjective. For consistency, pick one form and stick with it in a given news story or newscast. **Somali** is also the name of the country's language, as well as its main currency unit.

**sombre** (_not_ -er)

**some (one word)** someday, someplace, somebody, somebodies, somehow, someone, something, somewhat, somewhere (See also "some time" versus "sometime" below)

**some time** (two words, when some is an adj. and time a noun, as in "_At some time we'll do that_" and "_We'll do that for some time_"); **sometime** and **sometimes** (one word, when used together as an adv. to mean at some unspecified time/times, as in "_They'll return sometime soon_" and "_Sometimes the mice escape_"); **sometime** (one word, when used as an adj. to mean former or occasional, as in "_A sometime friend_" or "_A sometime contributor_"). TIP: If you can naturally slip a word between "some" and "time" then do not fuse them (e.g., "_At some distant time and date_").

**somersault soprano, sopranos SOS** (no periods) See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations)

**South, Southern** versus **south, southern** (See [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west))

**South Carolina (S.C.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**South Caucasus** (prefer over "Transcaucasia") A geographical area in the southern Caucasus Mountains, dividing Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It's made up of **Georgia, Armenia** and **Azerbaijan**, including the disputed region of [**Nagorno-Karabakh**](/home/n/nagorno-karabakh). (See also [**North Caucasus**](/home/n#NorthCaucasus), which is the other **half of the Caucasus,** also known as Caucasia.)

**Southern Hemisphere**

**South Korea** (preferred noun in virtually all news stories) There's generally no need to use the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea. (See also [country names](/home/g/geography-cities)) for general guidelines.) The term South Korea is widely understood and helps distinguish the republic from [North Korea](/home/n#NorthKorea). **South Korean** is both an adjective ("a South Korean company") and the name of the people ("thousands of South Koreans"). The capital city is Seoul. See also [Korean War](/home/k#KoreanWar).

**Southern Ocean** (prefer [**Antarctic Ocean**](/home/a/antarctic-ocean))

**southern Ontario** (one of two main geographical regions in the province; the other is **northern Ontario**) The south is traditionally divided into smaller areas: **southwestern Ontario** (e.g., Windsor), **central Ontario** (e.g., Toronto), **southeastern Ontario** (e.g., Kingston) and **eastern Ontario** (e.g., Ottawa). While such differentiation can be meaningful to a local or regional audience, it can also be potentially confusing to the rest of Canada. In those cases, more precise wording may be merited. (See [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west) for related guidelines)

**South Pole, the Pole**

**South Sudan** (OK in all references; does not need to be called the Republic of South Sudan) It officially became an independent country in July 2011. Before breaking away from [**Sudan**](/home/s#Sudan), it had secured limited autonomy as well as the promise of a referendum on separation after half a century of on-and-off war. **South Sudanese** is a noun (the people) as well as an adjective.

**sovereigntist** or **sovereignist** (both spellings are acceptable, based on common usage) For consistency, use one spelling throughout a news story. In broadcast journalism, try to use one spelling throughout a newscast whenever possible. See [**separatist and sovereigntist**](/home/s/separatist-sovereigntist)

**spin off** (v.), **spinoff** (n. and adj.)

square brackets**\[ \]** (See [punctuation](/handy-links/punctuation))

****square kilometre**** One square kilometre is equal to the area of a square measuring one kilometre on each side and is equivalent to 100 hectares. Both hectares and square kilometres are acceptable units of measurement for the size of a given portion of land, [such as in the case of a wildfire](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-05-15-hectares-and-square-kilometres/ "2025 05 15 - Hectares and square kilometres"), but the unit of measurement should be consistent in any given story.


**Srebrenica (Bosnia)**

**SS** (Nazi elite guard) There's no need to spell out "Schutzstaffel" but make sure the meaning is clear. In some contexts, SS also stands for "steamship."

[**St., St-, Ste-, Saint, Sainte**](/home/s/st-saint-ste), etc. Always check proper names carefully, including **St. John's** (Newfoundland) versus **St. John Ambulance**.

**state, state of California, New York state**, etc.

**state broadcasters** (government-owned and run networks, such as CCTV in China) State broadcasters operate in dictatorships and other regimes with limited freedoms. Do not confuse with **public broadcasters**, such as the CBC and BBC, which are government-funded but independently run networks in democracies, at arm's length from government or state power.

**state funeral** (see [**funerals**](/home/f/funerals) for various terms and common pitfalls, including the need to distinguish between Quebec's state funerals and national funerals)

**state of local emergency** The [term formalized by most provinces and territories](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-05-16-state-of-local-emergency-and-local-state-of-emergency/ "2025 05 16 - State of local emergency and local state of emergency") (note exceptions in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon).

**Statistics Canada** (avoid abbreviation except in headlines: StatsCan)

**staunch** (adj.), _a staunch ally_; (v.), _to staunch the flow_ (The verb used to be spelled without the _u_, but this is less common now in Canada. The Globe and Mail added the u to the verb in 2003. The Canadian Oxford also recommends a _u_ for both senses.)

**STD, STDs** (OK in headlines and second reference) Although the abbreviations are increasingly well known, prefer to spell out as "sexually transmitted disease(s)" at least once early on in a story (See also [Wassermann test](/home/w#Wassermann))

[**Ste-, St-, St., Saint, Sainte**](/home/s/st-saint-ste), etc. Always check proper names carefully, including **St. John's** (Newfoundland) versus **St. John Ambulance**.

[**St-Pierre-Miquelon**](/home/s#St-Pierre-Miquelon) (one of several acceptable spellings)

**strafe, strafing**

**straightforward** (no hyphen)

**strait** (generic) a narrow passage between two seas or other large bodies of water. Capitalized when part of a proper noun (e.g., the **M'Clure Strait** off the Northwest Territories, the **Taiwan Strait**, the **Strait of Hormuz**). For hundreds of years, "strait" was an alternative English spelling of "straight." Now, however, its use is mainly limited to the nautical sense of a relatively small waterway, as well as to the figurative sense of something confining or distressing (**dire straits**).

**straitjacket, straitlaced**

**stratagem, stratagems**

**strategic arms limitation talks** (SALT), SALT I, SALT II

**Stratford Shakespeare Festival** (_formerly_ the Stratford Festival), based in Stratford, Ont.

**stratum, strata** (See also [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals))

**streamline** (one word)

**Street** versus **street** (See [addresses](/home/a/addresses))

**streetcar** (one word)

**streptococcus, streptococci**, _but_ **strep throat** (_not_ strept) [Do not use italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**strike, strikers, strikebound** (one word) Always distinguish between a **strike** (when workers have walked off a job) and a **lockout** (when an employer refuses to let employees work). A **walkout** is another word for strike. As a dispute evolves, briefly provide context (e.g., "Canada Post employees were locked out after 12 days of rotating strikes"), and make sure adjectives are accurate (e.g., **striking workers** become **locked-out workers**). If particular action is deemed illegal, specify why (e.g., the employer was not given enough notice, legislation prevents the workers from striking). A [**wildcat strike**](/home/w#wildcatstrike) is a sudden walkout that's not authorized by the workers' union. Use **contract dispute** rather than "[labour dispute](/home/l#labourdispute)." Prefer [**picket**](/home/p#picket) over "picketer." Use **union leader, union head**, etc., instead of [union boss](/home/u#union-boss-bosses). Exercise extreme caution before using the work **strikebreaker**, even in quotations. Accusing someone of crossing a picket line can be very serious if the allegation is unfounded. It may also put an alleged strikebreaker at risk during a heated contract dispute. See also [**replacement worker**](/home/r/replacement-worker). The word **negotiation** is a generic description, although it often implies bargaining between the employer and employees only. In Canada, **conciliation** normally refers to a third party's attempt to help end an impasse before there's a walkout or lockout by clarifying positions and identifying possible compromises. The term **mediation** generally refers to negotiations with the aid of a third party after there's a walkout or lockout. Conciliators and mediators facilitate bargaining with suggestions but make no actual decisions. **Arbitration** refers to formal dispute resolution involving a third party who listens to both sides and then makes decisions. Since arbitration can be **binding** or **non-binding**, always specify. See also [**student strike**](/home/s#studentstrike) below, as well as **[boycott](/home/b/boycott)** for related guidelines and **[fired](/home/f/fired)** for caveats about contract termination.

**striptease**

**strongman** (fused)

**strong powers** (editorial caution) Generally prefer fact-based descriptions of legislation with titles such as Ontario's **2022 Strong Mayors, Building Homes Act**. While it's OK to report these proper nouns verbatim, neutral phrasing is often better in generic contexts  (e.g., referring to **special powers** or **expanded powers** given to some mayors). See [Act (legislation)](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/act/ "Act") for details.

**student strike** (Acceptable way to describe a large number of students refusing to attend class. Other options include [**boycott**](/home/b/boycott), protest and demonstration.) While the word [**strike**](/home/s#strike) is traditionally associated with employees who walk off the job, it's broadened over the years to include "a refusal to take part in scheduled or otherwise expected activity." This can range from the actions of a large group to one person (e.g., an individual's "hunger strike"). See the related note about the [Quebec student strike](/updates/2012/2012-05-24) of 2012.

**Styrofoam** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a type of plastic foam)

**sub (no hyphen)
****subantarctic, subarctic, subatomic, subcategory, subclass, subcommittee, subcommunity, subcompact, subconscious, subcontinent, subcontract, subcontractor, subdirectory, subdivide, subdivision, subflooring, subforeman, subgroup, subheading, subhuman, subjacent, sublease, submachine-gun, submerge, subnormal, substandard, subterranean, subtext, subtitle, subtotal** (See also entries on [submarine and subpoena](/home/s#submarine) below)

**sub- (hyphen)
****sub-assembly, sub-basement, sub-branch, sub-editor, sub-genre, sub-marginal, sub-lieutenant** ([Sub-Lt.](/home/m/military-ranks)), **sub-region, sub-Saharan, sub-zero** (NOTE: There's often no obvious reason for separating a prefix such as "sub" from the main word, as pointed out in the [hyphens overview](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens). Retaining punctuation in these cases is generally a matter of convention. For some prefixes, [such as re-](/home/r#reprefix), however, specific rules apply.)

**subcommittee** (lowercase), a **Commons subcommittee**, the **Senate subcommittee on cities** (See also [Commission versus commission, committee, subcommittee](/home/c/commission-committee-subcommittee) for details and more examples)

**_sub judice_** (two words) _Avoid_ this legal jargon, which simply means "under judicial consideration" in Latin. If you're forced to post the term (e.g., when transcribing a key quote that can't be deleted or paraphrased) then use [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics).

**submarine** ("sub" is OK in second reference and headlines) Submarines are boats _not_ ships. (See [boat versus ship](/home/b/boat-versus-ship)) The generic term "vessel" is fine.

**subpoena** (n. and v.), **subpoenas, subpoenaed, subpoenaing** ( A subpoena is usually issued to obtain documents or to get someone to appear as a witness in court.) See also [summonsed](/home/s#summons) below

**subtle, subtler, subtlest** (adj.), **subtly** (adv.), **subtlety** (n.), **subtleties**

**subtrade** (e.g., plumbers, electricians) In the construction industry, general contractors hire specialists, known as members of subtrades, to work on building projects.

**succinct, succinctly**

**Sudan** (African country) Conventionally called Sudan or **the Sudan**. Both are acceptable shorthand in first reference. The official name, the Republic of the Sudan, does not need to be used. **Sudanese** is a noun (the people) as well as an adjective. Compass points are indicated with lowercase modifiers (**western Sudan, northern Sudan**). Do not confuse with the independent country of [**South Sudan**](/home/s#SouthSudan).

**sudden infant death syndrome** (The abbreviation **SIDS** is fine in second reference)

**suffers from, suffers with** (_avoid_ when describing disabilities, illnesses, etc.) See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#afflicted)

[**suicide**](/home/s/suicide) (general reporting guidelines)

**suhoor** (meal eaten before dawn by Muslims observing Ramadan fasting) There are several spellings. For consistency, use this entrenched transliteration. (See also [Iftar](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/#iftar "I"))

**sulfa drugs** (_not_ sulpha or sulpher) Any anti-bacterial drug derived from sulfanilamide

**sulphide, sulphite, sulphur**

**sultan** (a title used by some Islamic sovereigns) Keep lowercase except when before a name **(Sultan Murad I)** or as part of a full title **(the Sultan of Brunei)** See also [shah](/home/s#shah)

**summer** (all seasons are lowercase unless part of a name, such as [Summer Olympics](/home/o#Olympics))

**summerfallow**

**Summer Olympics, the Summer Games, the Olympic Games, the Olympics, the Games summit, an economic summit**, etc., but the **World Summit on the Information Society** (actual name of event)

**summons, summonses, summonsed** (Although "summonsed" to appear in court, not "summoned," is accurate, "ordered to" is far more conversational.) A summons is a "writ of summons," often issued to someone accused of something. (See also [subpoenaed](/home/s#subpoena) above)

**sun** (See also [space terms](/home/s/space-terms))

**Sunshine List** (Document identifying the names and annual salaries of Ontario's public sector employees earning above a specific dollar figure)

**sunk** (see [sank](/home/s#sank))

**Sunni Muslim** (See [Islam](/home/i/islam))

**super (as a prefix)
**Generally, "super" is fused to the other word — even when the latter begins with another "r." For example: **superabundant, superbug, supercritical, superfine, superhuman, supermarket, supermom, supernatural, supernova, superpower, superrefined, supersize** (adj. and verb),**superstar, superstore, superstructure, supertanker**. But in a few cases there's a hyphen, based on convention, such as: **super-absorbent, super-angry, super-Conservative, super-duper, super-jail**. Check the Canadian Oxford dictionary if you're uncertain. Use the modifier "super" on its own (without a hyphen) in compound constructions only when it's treated as part of a proper noun (e.g., **Super Bowl, Super Continental**).

**Super Bowl** (See also [football terms](/home/f/football))

**superbug** (drug-resistant bacteria or other microorganism) See also [bacteria versus virus](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) for related style and editorial guidelines, as well as the CBCNews.ca feature [Battling germs that keep getting stronger](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2Fbattling-germs-that-keep-getting-stronger-1.781633&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw35TVhrJDNLUlXEkPZe9i1Z) for specific background on superbugs.

**supercilious** (_not_ -silious)

**superintendent** (Supt.) See also [police ranks](/home/p/police-ranks)

**super PAC** (two words; no hyphen; lowercase "s") Refers to groups that can essentially spend unlimited amounts of money to try to influence U.S. elections as long as they don't actually contribute funds to specific parties or candidates. It's normally unnecessary to spell out PAC as "**political action committee**," since the term is now entrenched. But be sure that the story's context makes the meaning clear. See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for more detailed guidelines on applicable capitalization rules.

**supersede** (take the place of; set aside; appoint someone else; cease to employ)

**superspreader, superspreading** (fused) Refers to the transmission of an infection to an unusually high number of people (e.g., the wedding became a **superspreader event**). Generally avoid describing individual people as "superspreaders" (i.e., do not use the word as an agent noun) because it's considered unnecessarily demonizing, especially in the middle of an [epidemic or pandemic](/home/e/endemic-epidemic-pandemic).

**Superstack** (iconic smokestack in Sudbury) See also [nicknames](/home/n/nicknames)

**supervised injection site** (common and acceptable term) While the older label **safe injection site** remains OK when space is tight (e.g., in web headlines), the adjective "supervised" is fact-based, more descriptive and, so, generally best. There's no ban against "safe" as a modifier in established constructions (e.g., "**safe sex**" conventionally means "safer" or "protected sex," and "**safe injection**" conventionally means "safer" or "medically supervised" injection). But there's also no need to rely on this sometimes contested use of "safe" as our default wording when common and equally conversational alternatives exist. Be aware that some people prefer the broader word "consumption" over "injection" to cover nasal and oral drug delivery. It's OK to use phrasing like **supervised consumption site** as long as the meaning is clear from a given story's context, but it's not mandatory. While some drugs may be inhaled or swallowed at these centres, needles are still widely used — which means the facilities, themselves, can still be accurately described as supervised "injection" sites rather than "consumption" sites. The noun **clinic** is generally fine as a synonym for "site" in our stories, as long as a modifier like "injection" or "consumption" is included to distinguish these centres from routine medical clinics. It's worth noting that the word clinic is broadly defined in English (e.g., blood donor clinics, dental clinics, golfing clinics, legal clinics, writing clinics). (See also [Insite](/home/i#Insite))

**support** (n. normally singular) The word **"support" is a common verb** (e.g., "She supports him" and "They have a family to support"). It's **also a common adjective** (e.g., "A support beam") that sometimes functions as one part of a compound noun rather than as a simple modifier (e.g., "support staff"). **As a standalone noun, "support" is normally singular** (e.g., "They applied for financial support"), unless specific, individual supports are treated as countable rather than non-countable elements (e.g., "The bridge's steel supports buckled"). This distinguishes the word from a term like "services" (e.g., "The Opposition says the cost of those services is out of control"). Outside of direct quotes, resist the unorthodox use of the plural noun "supports" in non-countable contexts (e.g., "They qualified for federal and provincial support" rather than "They qualified for federal and provincial supports").

**suppress, suppression, suppressor supremacist** (_not_ supremist)

**Supreme Court** (federal, provincial, state)

**Supreme Court of Canada** (**SCC**, not "SCOC") Since neither abbreviation is well known, it's generally best to use other short forms (e.g., "top court" or "highest court"). But in TV graphics or web headlines where space is tight, SCC is OK. For details on why O is conventionally left out, see [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations).

**Sûreté du Québec** (**SQ** fine in second reference, as well as in web headlines) Since this noun is not instantly recognized across the country, be sure the story makes it clear that Sûreté du Québec refers to Quebec's provincial police. For CBC journalism outside Quebec, especially broadcast material, it's fine to prefer the description **Quebec provincial police** throughout. See also [police forces](/home/p/police-forces) and [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) for related guidelines.

**Suriname** (_not_ "Surinam") A country on the northeast coast of South America. The capital city is Paramaribo.

**surveys** (see public opinion [polls](/home/p/polls))

**Suu Kyi, Aung San** (pro-democracy leader in **[Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar)** for several decades, and winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize) **Suu Kyi** is fine in web headlines and in second reference, as explained more fully in our overview of [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names).

**Swaziland** (now called **[Eswatini](/home/e#Eswatini)**)

**swear in** (v.) The past participle is **sworn in**: "She was sworn in last month." **swearing-in** (n.) "The swearing-in was delayed by an hour." **swearing-in** (adj.) "The swearing-in ceremony will be held on Friday."

**sweatshirt**

**sweetgrass**

**swine flu, swine flu virus, swine flu vaccine** (lowercase) OK in first reference (headlines and leads). Generally use the alphanumeric name of the influenza A virus after that (e.g., **H1N1, H1N2, H3N2**). In TV and web graphics, prefer H1N1, H1N2, etc. When adding scientific context in second reference, options include: the **H1N1 influenza virus**, the **H1N1 flu virus**, the **H1N2 flu** and the **H1N2 virus**. Avoid hyphens, slashes, etc. It's a **Type A flu**. (See [**flu**](/home/f/flu) for detailed guidelines on influenza, as well as [bacteria versus virus](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) for related terminology.)

**syllabus, syllabuses symbol, symbolize symmetrical, symmetry symphony**, Beethoven's **Symphony No. 9** or Beethoven's **Ninth Symphony**, etc.

**synagogue**, but **Beth Emeth Bais Yehuda Synagogue**, etc. (See also [churches](/home/c/church))

**sync** (short for synchronization) Prefer this spelling (**out of sync, synced, lip-syncing**). For consistency, avoid the alternative "h" version.

**syndrome, Reye's syndrome, Down syndrome**, etc.

**synod, an Anglican synod**; but uppercase when referring to a national or international body (**the General Synod**) as well as in specific proper nouns (the **Northeastern Pennsylvania Synod** is one of 65 synods in the Evangelical Lutheran Church; the **Orthodox Holy Synod**)

**syphilis**

**Syrah** (a variety of black grape used in winemaking; originally grown in France)

**syrup** (_not_ sirup)

### SARS

**SARS**

**SARS is a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness caused by a strain of [coronavirus](/home/c/coronavirus)** — the same family of viruses tied to the common cold.

**The abbreviation is in capital letters with no periods. The full name is lowercase** (i.e., we write "**severe acute respiratory syndrome**"). This is also the case with AIDS. (See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations))

SARS is now a relatively common acronym. Whenever practical, the full name of the illness should be spelled out at some point in web stories. In broadcast scripts, however, more conversational options are generally OK (e.g., simply referring to SARS in second reference as an "acute respiratory illness").


**'SARS virus'**
Be careful when using medical terms. **SARS is an illness rather than a virus**. It's caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). **Referring to SARS as a virus is as imprecise as calling AIDS a virus.** Put another way: Just because [AIDS](/home/a/aids) is believed to be caused by a virus (HIV) doesn't make AIDS, itself, a "virus."

In most stories, there's **generally no need to use long, formal names like "SARS-associated coronavirus."** Instead, **it's an acceptable convention to write about SARS**, a SARS outbreak, people with SARS, **the SARS virus**, the **virus that causes SARS**. etc.


**SARS-like infections**
Although the last case of SARS connected to the original (2002-03) outbreak was reported in China in 2004, experts have warned that it could resurface, perhaps in mutated forms. In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control listed SARS as a severe potential health threat to the world. In 2017, scientists found bats infected with SARS-related coronaviruses.

Term such as **SARS-like illness**, a **SARS-like virus**, etc., are **OK as long as medical experts are using similar language.** But **prefer specific names when known**. In January 2020, for example, there were reports of a SARS-like outbreak in China. Eventually, the illness was named [COVID-19](/home/c/coronavirus#COVID), reflecting the fact that the first case was actually recorded in late 2019. The **COVID-19 virus, itself, was eventually named SARS-CoV-2** for reasons explained in this [February 2020 World Health Organization post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Femergencies%2Fdiseases%2Fnovel-coronavirus-2019%2Ftechnical-guidance%2Fnaming-the-coronavirus-disease-\(covid-2019\)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3xQ7lDAvO6aXB5XXE4EYzf). When reporting on emerging viruses and diseases, it's **helpful to mention key similarities** (e.g., respiratory illness) **and any known or apparent differences**, especially in standard virulence measurements (e.g., mortality rates, transmission risks and rates).


**Illness, infection, disease**
Writers and editors looking for SARS synonyms have a number of options. Health Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control use words like **"illness," "infection" and "disease." All these terms are OK in our news stories.** Although the word "syndrome" on its own is accurate, it seems unnecessarily lofty, especially when there are alternatives. (See also [bacteria versus virus](/home/b/bacteria-versus-virus) for guidelines on using the correct terminology in health and science stories.)


**Avoid dated terms**
**The World Health Organization initially called the illness ARS** (acute respiratory syndrome) after hundreds of people became sick in China's Guangdon province in late 2002. In February 2003, one of the organization's experts on communicable diseases, Dr. Carol Urbani, renamed the disease SARS. He contracted it during his research and died. The first SARS death in Canada was in March 2003. **WHO officials called SARS "atypical pneumonia" a lot early on, but they stopped using that expression in later news releases. Be wary of repeating old terms that are no longer considered appropriate.**


See also the 2004 CBCNews.ca feature, [SARS](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Fbackground%2Fsars%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1tjGES9Q3GjednCPpoOb9p)

### say

**Say versus admit, claim, concede, etc.**

**NOTE:** For brevity, the word "say" is primarily used in this entry. But these guidelines apply to all forms of "say," including "says" and "said."


Some words are **superb workhorses**, including **say, says, and said.** They're **highly effective** because they're **neutral and unobtrusive.**

**"Say" is clear and conversational.** It doesn't change the meaning of sentences or the tone of stories. It doesn't distract attention or occupy much space. It's **well suited to our journalism**, and remains **the default choice of many good writers and editors.**

People don't always just SAY certain things, of course. Sometimes they acknowledge, agree, argue, ask, certify, challenge, conclude, contend, deduce, demand, dispute, insist, interrupt, lament, question, recall, reiterate, reply, respond, etc. Such **alternatives are perfectly acceptable as long as they're accurate.** For instance, there's a world of difference between **recount** (to tell) and **recant** (to retract). There's also a crucial distinction between **reject** (to disagree) and **refute** (to disprove).

**Always pause to consider whether specific wording is factual and suitable. Two tips:**


> **1\. Avoid using an assortment of "say" verbs solely to jazz up stories.** "Admit" is an example. Someone might agree with certain facts, confirm certain behavior, etc. But acknowledgment is not the same as admission.
>
> **2\. Refrain from repeating previously common but inappropriate or archaic expressions.** "Admit," again, is an example. We should never refer to someone who "admits" being gay, bi, trans, etc. The verb implies wrongdoing — as pointed out in our [2SLGBTQ+ overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#miscellaneous "2SLGBTQ+").


Here's **a list of some words that have caused headaches in broadcast scripts and web articles in the past** because of their narrower, conventional meanings. They're **NOT merely "say synonyms"** and, so, must be used with care.


> **Admit** implies a confession of wrongdoing or a concession.
> **Affirm** asserts strongly or confirms.
> **Allege** suggests an unproven accusation. (See [allege](/home/a/allege) for legal caveats)
> **Assert** declares resolutely.
> **Claim** suggests doubt or dispute.
> **Concede** admits or allows defeat.
> **Confess** acknowledges fault, impropriety, illegality, etc.
> **Confide** implies a confidence.
> **Declare** proclaims publicly or explicitly.
> **Disclose** presumes prior concealment.
> **Explain** gives reasoning or explanation.
> **Note** calls attention to details.
> **Maintain** can wrongly imply defensiveness.
> **Opine** expresses opinion directly.
> **Rebut** implies a tenable counterargument
> **Refute** conventionally means to disprove with evidence (i.e., NOT merely to deny)
> **Reveal** suggests prior concealment.


Remember: **The arena of standard English is teeming with nuance. So be cautious and thoughtful.** An assertion is something beyond a statement, and a rebuttal is something more than a bald rejection. As an old CBC Radio style manual put it many decades ago: "_Almost always prefer the simple, honest and unpretentious 'say' over its many substitutes and variants. You can use the variants, of course, but you must use them for accuracy, not for the sake of variety._"

### scandal

**Scandal**

This **word requires care**, especially in political reporting.

**Scandal generally implies public outrage**. Although the Canadian Oxford Dictionary also lists "malicious gossip or backbiting" as a secondary definition, that meaning is conventionally associated with tabloid coverage of celebrities.

To maintain fairness and impartiality, **it's important to distinguish between common partisan outcry**, which can be strategically theatrical, **and genuine public anger or shock**, which can be comparatively harder to assess. Resignations are seen as signposts to many, but the departures, themselves, may warrant a closer look.

In December 2019, for example, federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced plans to step down. Some news organizations ran headlines like "Scheer resigns after private school scandal." However, the leader of the Official Opposition denied any wrongdoing in the ruckus over his use of Conservative Party money for his children's private school tuition. And while details of those expenditures caused some internal party bickering, there was no evidence of widespread public outrage.

It's **OK to use the noun "scandal" when the facts fit** (e.g., Canada's [**Senate expenses scandal**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fsenate-expense-scandal-timeline-1.3677457&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0JYJNhBZ6ziL8Dme2yZkdY) between 2012 and 2016 exposed lax rules and improper financial reimbursement). **But if details are ambiguous and the indignation largely appears confined to partisan camps, different wording is often better**. For instance:


> **Affair** (connotes a notable and potentially troubling misstep).
> **Controversy** (describes anything disputed or controversial).
> **Probe** (refers to something under formal investigation).


**Another option is to use fact-based, descriptive phrasing** (e.g., "an ethics breach" instead of "an ethics scandal" in a story about a violation of conflict of interest guidelines).

### school

**School versus school**

The word **"school" is lowercase unless part of the proper name of a building or educational institution**. (A school, such as law or medicine, within a college or university is also lowercase unless the formal name is used):

### Sea-of-Japan\_East-Sea

**Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea**

**To maintain impartiality and fairness** in a dispute over the name of a body of water between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, **point out that it's called the Sea of Japan as well as the East Sea whenever practical.** In particular, we should:

-   **Add the alternative name once** high up in stories (e.g., "also known as …").
-   **Prefer TV and web maps that use both names** (e.g., Sea of Japan / East Sea).

Brackets are an effective option in web articles. While it can be challenging to include the same information in broadcast scripts, **we should strive to add the detail in the most conversational way, regardless of the platform** — along the lines of how we refer to "[Londonderry, also known as Derry](/home/l/londonderry-versus-london)."


**Story focus, audience familiarity**

It's **normally fine to use Sea of Japan in first reference in generic stories** because the name is so deeply entrenched, and **then add wording such as "also known as the East Sea" once.** This approach is also sensible in first reference when reports are exclusively or primarily about Japan.

**Prefer East Sea in first reference in stories that are exclusively or primarily about South Korea or North Korea,** and **then add wording such as "also known as the Sea of Japan" once.** This parenthetical detail is crucial since the former name is not as well known to most Canadians, based on historical usage, and since East Sea might be wrongly confused with East China Sea.


**Background and UN position**

Japan joined the United Nations in 1956. South Korea and North Korea joined in 1991 as the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, respectively. The dispute over the name Sea of Japan erupted at the UN shortly afterward and has continued for decades, with each country lobbying governments and media around the world.

**Tokyo argues for Sea of Japan** because it says the established hydronym is well known around the globe in numerous languages (e.g., "Mer du Japon" in French). **Seoul argues that the name East Sea has deep historical roots** on and around the Korean Peninsula, and labels the name Sea of Japan an offensive relic of colonial power. **Pyongyang, meanwhile, frequently adds a modifier** to Seoul's compass-point name: Korean East Sea. **The United Nations says it does not have jurisdiction to resolve the dispute**. While the UN Secretariat tends to use Sea of Japan in its own documents, it has explicitly stated that this does not mean that the United Nations has actually ruled on the merits of either name. **UN committees, meanwhile, have repeatedly encouraged the countries involved to settle the matter themselves.**

For decades, Tokyo cited use of the Sea of Japan by **the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)** as evidence that its position is broadly backed by the international community. But Seoul disagreed, pointing out that when the IHO officially adopted "Sea of Japan" in 1929, the Koreas could not participate in discussions about the name because they were under Japanese rule. The IHO, which has observer status at the UN, is considered an authority on oceanic surveying. Among other things, it sets standards for nautical cartography. Various IHO committees reviewed the dispute between Japan and the Koreas over the years but declined to issue a final ruling. In November 2020, the IHO announced it was adopting **a new system of numerical designations for bodies of water**. Critics called use of numbers instead of words an interesting diplomatic strategy, but one that ultimately sidesteps a meaningful solution to controversial names. They also said numerical designations for seas, lakes, rivers, etc., had zero chance of becoming widespread in everyday speech and writing around the globe.


### separatist sovereigntist

**Separatist and sovereigntist / sovereignist**

The terms **separatist and sovereigntist are used interchangeably in Canada** to describe supporters of Quebec independence. **Both are acceptable.**
**In Quebec, the spelling sovereignist is seen and heard more frequently** because it more closely matches the French equivalent, _souverainiste_. **CBC News used to prefer a "-tist" suffix (i.e., sovereigntist instead of sovereignist)** based on the term's root: sovereignty. This was also the approach taken at many other major English news services, including CP. **But either spelling is now acceptable** (i.e., sovereigntist or sovereignist), based on common usage. **For consistency, use one spelling throughout a news story** (and in the case of TV or radio, throughout a newscast whenever possible).

**The above latitude (-tist or -ist) applies to the spoken word as well.**
 See [pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmtlntapps08.apps.in.cbcsrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D34494&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2gf9RCtVBOU9OkZpQwkt-U) for details

Neither separatist nor sovereigntist (sovereignist) appears in the federal government's 2000 Clarity Act, which uses "secession" throughout. But **"secessionist" is not part of the common Canadian lexicon, so it's generally a poorer choice** for English news stories about Quebec independence. **Anglicized forms of the French word indépendantiste** (i.e., "independantiste" and "independentist") **are rarely used for the same reason**.

Constitutional experts point out that **independence, itself, does not automatically mean the severance of all ties** with Canada. R**egardless, "Quebec sovereignty" and "Quebec separation" do imply formal secession** from the federation.

**Be aware that not everyone perceives the words "sovereignty" and "separation" as neutral.** The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage points out that separatist is "commonly used by those who dislike the idea of Quebec's breaking up" while sovereigntist is "favoured by those who espouse a sovereign Quebec." **For this reason, it can be a good practice to include both terms in our stories when there's space.**

The term **sovereignty-association** has been around since the 1960s. It is the standard English translation of one of the original slogans of the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association in Quebec. The exact meaning is debatable since there's no consensus on the nature and depths of ties being proposed.

### slum, ghetto, shantytown

**Slum, ghetto, shantytown, etc.**

**There's no universally accepted definition of "slum." It's applied to a range of substandard housing conditions in different parts of the world.** Since the term is so broad, context is relevant. The rental property of a "slum landlord" in North America, for example, usually means something very different from, say, the dwellings in Dharavi, on the outskirts of Mumbai, where parts of the movie _Slumdog Millionaire_ were filmed.

**Here are some general guidelines about "slum" and a few related words:**

**_favela_**
**Portuguese for shantytown in Brazil. Slum is an acceptable alternative.** Examples are Rocinha and the Alemao complex. **_Favela_ is too obscure to use in our journalism without a brief definition** (e.g., "Drug trafficking is rampant in the many shantytowns, or _favelas_, around Rio de Janeiro"). The same principle applies to similar nouns plucked from other languages (e.g., the Spanish term **_villa miseria_** used in Argentina and the French word _bidonville_ used in Morocco). In web stories, all of these labels should be in italics because they're considered [foreign rather than English](/home/f/foreign-words). See also [shantytown](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#shantytown) below.


**ghetto**
**A specific type of [slum](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slum) based on the shared ethnic or religious roots of its inhabitants.** The plural is **ghettos**.


**shantytown**
**Acceptable as a synonym for [slum](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slum) in some places**, based on entrenched usage. The word **originally applied to densely populated camps of shanties** (flimsily constructed shacks of discarded metal, plywood and other makeshift materials). But it **now also describes districts that feature larger and more permanent structures** (e.g., multi-storey concrete and brick buildings) in several countries, including Brazil. **It's generally OK to use the terms "shantytown" and "slum" interchangeably** — something the United Nations and various other aid organizations routinely do. See also [**_favela_**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#favela) above.


**slum**
**A crowded area of either squalid or generally substandard housing inhabited by poor people.** Levels of filth vary, as do outbreaks of disease, rates of crime, and so forth. **They lack at least some— but not necessarily all — of the very basics** (e.g., reliable sources of clean water and electricity, good sanitation systems, regular policing, firefighting and garbage removal). Actual land titles and registered addresses do not always exist, making some occupants more like squatters than renters. **Extreme poverty is the underlying common denominator and is what really distinguishes a "low-income neighbourhood" from a slum.** In some countries, slums are primarily found in areas that were once new but are now dilapidated. In other places, especially in the developing world, slums have grown almost entirely out of makeshift structures (e.g., tents, shanties) built near large urban centres. [**Ghettos**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#ghetto) are specific types of slums. [**Shantytowns**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#shantytown) are commonly and acceptably referred to as slums. See also [**slum landlord**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slumlandlord) and [**slum-like**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slumlike) for broader uses of the word.


**slum landlord**
An acceptable term used primarily in North America to describe **the owner of rental property that's well below acceptable housing standards in Canada and the U.S.** If someone is accused of being a slum landlord, no reasonable person would assume that this means the building in question is actually in a [**slum**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slum) or that the conditions are comparable to the very worst housing conditions on the planet. Rather, the claim being made is that the property is [**slum-like**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slumlike).


**slum-like**
Describes **property that is so well below local housing standards it would be considered uninhabitable by most reasonable people.** An old but structurally sound building that desperately needs a coat of paint and windows repaired is not slum-like. But housing in some parts of North America may well be, including on Indigenous reserves. **To make our journalism clear, be as specific as possible about the problems** (e.g., mice, bugs or other pests, holes in walls, a leaking roof, unsafe wiring, backed-up sewage) when likening any housing to an actual [**slum**](/home/s/slum-ghetto-shantytown#slum).

### so-called

**So-called**

The adjective has **two contradictory meanings:**

**(1) "known as," "commonly called"**


> It's an example of the so-called "Stockholm syndrome."
> The company plans to use the so-called "poison pill defence."


**(2) "wrongly named," "insincerely called"**


> "Her so-called ‘friends' are a big help," he scoffed.
> "His so-called ‘poetry' hasn't been published," she said.

**
Always define meanings that aren't widely known.**


> The "poison pill defence" is a way to fend off hostile takeovers. A company can flood the market with extra shares, for instance, making the unwanted bid more expensive.


In broadcast copy, the term so-called can be an effective substitute for punctuation that's missing from scripts intended for the ear only. On the web, it can also be a good way to emphasize certain wording. And **sometimes the adjective is required to comply with existing CBC News guidelines**, such as "[so-called honour killings](/home/h#honourkillings)."
**But editorial caution is required both online and on air. Never use "so-called" in a story if the meaning could be misconstrued** (e.g., if definition 1 above is intended but definition 2 could be easily inferred by mistake). For instance, _a so-called road map to peace_ might suggest "what's commonly referred to as the road map to peace" as well as "a path that will lead to more violence, not actual peace." Since the wording is unclear the sentence should be changed.

> **wrong**
>
> They're debating details of the so-called road map to peace in the Middle East.
>
> **correct**
>
> They're debating details of a U.S.-backed proposal known as the "road map to peace" in the Middle East.


**Routinely using "so-called" as a substitute for fact-based attribution can quickly, and needlessly, lead to perceptions of bias** by some members of our audience, as noted in a 2022 [CBC Ombudsman's post about "so-called"](https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/ombudsman/blog/Ombud_Inbox_April_2022). For instance, instead of writing about "the so-called Freedom Convoy" that rolled into Ottawa in February of that year, we can convey the same point neutrally by referring to, say, the **self-styled "Freedom Convoy,"** or to **what organizers dubbed the "Freedom Convoy."**


**Quotation marks and so-called**
**Quotation marks are optional after _so-called_**, according to various usage authorities. In CBCNews.ca stories, **such punctuation is recommended for terms that are relatively new, or for fragments of direct quotations when the speaker is stressing irony** (e.g., "She was abandoned by her so-called 'friends,'" he said).

Always use single quotation marks around words that already fall within double quotations. For a more detailed look at quotation marks, see [punctuation](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/handy-links/punctuation/quotation-marks/ "Quotation marks").

### soccer

**Soccer terms**

attacking midfielder, chip pass, chip shot, close down, corner kick, counterattack, defensive midfielder, goal line, goalkeeper, goal kick, halfway line, handball, marking back, midfield, midfielder, offside, own-goal (n., adj.), penalty shot, red card, red-carded, Round of 16 (FIFA World Cup term), shoot out (v.), shootout (n.), through ball, throw in (v.), throw-in (n., adj.), wingback, yellow card, yellow-carded

**FIFA** (Does NOT need to be spelled out as **Fédération Internationale de Football Association**.) The abbreviation should be identified as "soccer's world governing body" as high as possible in stories, unless it's simply included as part of an event's name (e.g., the FIFA World Cup). It's common practice to use the full name of a given World Cup tournament once in first reference (e.g., the [**2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/f/fifa-world-cup-2010/ "Fifa world cup 2010")), and then to use shorthand variations in second reference (e.g., the **2010 FIFA World Cup** or the **FIFA World Cup** or even the **World Cup** once context has been established). The full, formal name often includes a single geographical location, such as Brazil, Germany or Qatar, but there are exceptions (e.g., the **2026 FIFA World Cup** was awarded to Canada, the U.S. and Mexico). When distinguishing between gender-specific competitions, capitalize the modifier for consistency (i.e., **Men's World Cup** and **Women's World Cup**). Be aware that FIFA technically includes the possessive word Women's only in its official tournament names (e.g., the [**2011 FIFA Women's World Cup**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2011/2011-06-25/ "2011 06 25") in Germany and the **2023 FIFA Women's World Cup** in Australia and New Zealand). For consistency, however, our style is to treat the detail Women's and Men's the same way, assuming either possessive is actually needed in a given report.

**Generally prefer the word "soccer" over "football" when referring to the sport**, unless it's part of a proper noun (e.g., TFC stands for the Toronto Football Club, also known as Toronto FC). This extends to coverage of international contests (e.g., a World Cup soccer match) because the word "soccer" is clearest to our general audience. It's worth noting that Toronto's **BMO Field,** itself, is commonly described as a "**soccer field**" for TFC matches, and as a "**football field**" for Toronto Argonaut games.

**NOTE: It's a myth that the word "soccer" is an Americanism.** In fact, the term was coined in Britain in the 1880s. "Soccer" — originally known as "assocer" — was a clipped version of "association football." Over the decades, "assocer" was shortened to "soccer." The name was intended as a quick way to distinguish "association football" from "rugby football" in the U.K. Although the word "soccer" was largely abandoned in Britain by the 1970s, it became increasingly entrenched in Canada and the U.S.

See the [sports overview](/home/s/sports-overview) for links to various other entries, including baseball, basketball, curling, football, golf, hockey and Olympics.

### South Asian, Indian, Indo-Canadian

**South Asian, Indian, Indo-Canadian**

**Avoid the invented term "East Indian,"** which offends many people of South Asian descent. It wrongly suggests they are either from a fictional land or from the Malay Archipelago. (The East Indies, now known as the Malay Archipelago, refers to Indonesia and several other states between Australia and Vietnam.)

There is no country or region officially called East India. There is, however, a place called **India**. Its citizens and descendants are **Indian**.

**Indian, Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.**
**When specific South Asian background is known, specify:**

> The bombing killed 329 people, including 82 children. Among the victims were 280 Canadian citizens, mostly born in India or of _Indian_ descent.

**South Asian**
**When such details are not known,** or when we're referring to people from more than one country in the Indian subcontinent, use the general terms **South Asia, South Asian:**

> Two days before the bombings, police say a man of South Asian descent went to the Canadian Pacific Airlines ticket office in downtown Vancouver. He paid cash for two tickets. Both were registered under the last name "Singh."

**Indo-Canadian**
**Indo-Canadian traditionally refers to migrants from the Indian subcontinent** now living in Canada, **or to Canadian citizens who are descendants of people from that region.**

> The statements outraged leaders of the local _Indo-Canadian_ community.
>
> Many _Indo-Canadian_ business leaders belong to the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce.
>
> The _Indo-Canadian_ Friendship Society of British Columbia agrees.


Be aware, however, that **some people consider the term Indo-Canadian outmoded.** Respect individual preferences when known.

See also [geographical demonyms](/home/r/racial-terms#geographical) (African American, Korean Canadian) for related guidelines.


**Indigenous, Aboriginal, First Nations**
"East Indian" was coined years ago in an effort to distinguish Indigenous people in North America from citizens of India. In most stories, however, the context is already clear.

**Two sentences that provide enough context to use "Indian" instead of South Asian:**

> Curry is often used in _Indian_ food.
>
> To him, _Indian_ food suggests pemmican not pappadum.


**A headline that requires "South Asian" instead of "Indian" to be clear:**

> B.C. restaurateur starving for _South Asian_ chefs


**Both sets of examples illustrate an important point: Do not automatically type "South Asian" instead of "Indian." Common sense is required.**

There are several deciding factors in the restaurateur case above. First, web headlines float on their own as links in lists of stories, so they aren't read in the context of a lead paragraph, a photograph, etc. Second, "Indian chefs" could be misinterpreted as "Indigenous chefs" because the expression is not as well known as "Indian food" or "Indian restaurant." Finally, Indian "chefs" could easily be misread as "chiefs."

**When referring to Indigenous people in North America, using the adjective Indigenous, Aboriginal or First Nations** (when applicable) **can help avoid possible confusion.** (See [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) for details.)

See also [racial terms](/home/r/racial-terms).

### Soviet Union

**Soviet Union**

**The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) was formed in 1922**. By the early 1940s it had grown to 15 republics (after annexing three Baltic states in a deal with Nazi Germany). **The Soviet Union dissolved at the end of 1991.**

_Avoid the abbreviation U.S.S.R._ except in transcribed quotes or when providing historical context. Use the term _“the former Soviet Union”_ instead.

There is usually no need to include the Russian abbreviation (C.C.C.P.) in news stories. When transliterated into our alphabet, these Cyrillic letters actually become S.S.S.R. (Soyuz Sovyetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik). The term U.S.S.R. was adopted years ago in the English-speaking world.

**sun and moon, but Earth and earth**
**The sun and moon** as well as their derivatives (helio- and lunar) **are always lowercase. Capitalize "Earth" only when emphasizing that it's a planet** (e.g., in stories about a NASA mission, a study into global warming or astronomy):

**
Keep the proper names of meteorological phenomena lowercase:**

meteor shower
northern lights
aurora australis
aurora borealis
**Use arabic numerals** (Saturn 5 not Saturn V) **for spacecraft and launch vehicles:**

Sputnik 1, Apollo 13, Gemini 4, Mercury 7, Pioneer 10, Alouette 2, Anik C1, Anik D2, etc.

### speaker

**Speaker**

**To avoid confusing the generic word “speaker” (one who speaks) with the title Speaker, we always use a capital “S”** when referring to the person who keeps order and makes rulings inside national or regional legislative assemblies.

**This applies even if the title does not appear before a name, if it refers to a deputy, or if a person no longer holds the office** (a departure from our normal practice with capital letters):

Speaker Peter Puck
the Speaker
deputy Speaker Patrick Puck
the deputy Speaker
former Speaker Gilbert Parent
House of Commons Speaker
House Speaker
the Speaker of the Saskatchewan Legislature
the Speaker of Quebec's National Assembly \*

\* = _In French, this position is known as "président" of the National Assembly. However, we and virtually all other English news organizations use the term Speaker in this case for the same reason we call the head of Quebec's government the premier rather than the "prime minister." Entrenched English translation conventions apply. It's worth noting that in the House of Commons, the Speaker is also called "le président" in French._

### Spelling

**Spelling overview**



**Canadian preferences**
**Canadians use a blend of British** (_cheque_ not _check_) **and North American** (_tire_ not _tyre_) **spellings**. Although some preferences are fairly common (_plow_ and _axe_, for instance, instead of _plough_ and _ax_), other words are frequently written in more than one way (_acknowledgement_ and _acknowledgment_).

Sometimes a word has more than one spelling on both sides of the Atlantic. The reasons for this vary, from evolution ("_expresso_" based on many people's mispronunciation of _espresso_) to the lack of consensus over a transliteration (_Muhammad_ and _Mohammed_). It can be _whacky_ (although we prefer _wacky_).

**We follow a [modified Canadian Press style](/home/s/spelling/modified-cp-style)**. Some of the broad guidelines include retaining the "u" in many "our" endings (_colour, labour, favour_), doubling the "l" before many suffixes (_carolling, labelling, signalling, travelling_), dropping the "muted e" when adding "able" to certain words (_likable, movable, sizable_), and shortening ligatures such as "æ" to "e" in many words (_anesthetic, encyclopedia, medieval, paleontology_). See [lingering ligatures](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/spelling/lingering-ligatures/ "Lingering ligatures") for exceptions (e.g., _archaeology_ and _caesarean_).

**When two or more spellings are fairly widespread, CBC News declares a preference to maintain the professional sheen of consistency** (e.g., catalogue, program and raccoon instead of catalog, programme and racoon).

**Never assume a spelling.** _Vapour_ and _honour_ both have a "u," for instance, but _vaporize_ and _honorary_ do not. (See [our and or](/home/s/spelling/our)) And while we generally follow the official spelling of a proper noun in English (e.g., the _World Trade Center_, not _Centre_), we make an exception for U.S. government departments. (See [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) as well as the overview [Avoid inapt Americanisms](/home/a/americanisms))


**Check this site first**
**CBC journalists should consult this intranet site for any spellings they're not sure about** before looking elsewhere. **The Language Guide includes certain words not found in other reference material** (e.g., some proper nouns and newly coined terms), **as well as exceptions to our primary external source for spelling**, the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

There is an alphabetical list, where you'll find _Muhammad_ and more than 5,000 other terms. If you don't spot what you're looking for in the A to Z indexes, try the Language Guide's search engine. It's an effective tool for quickly finding entries.

We do not generally list words that have only one spelling, unless they're commonly used and misspelled a lot (e.g., _occurred_ and _accommodation_ both appear but _exuberant_ does not because it doesn't show up in news stories very often, and _bedbug_ is included because some people still write it as two words but _bedroom_ and _bedspread_ are not because errors are rare).


**Canadian Oxford Dictionary**
**If a word is not listed in this Language Guide, look at the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. An [online version](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfordreference.com%2Fview%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780195418163.001.0001%2Facref-9780195418163&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2mRZaIul-Z7mN0jH4lOO-e) of the latest edition is available to all staff from any CBC newsroom. Passwords are not required.**

Since dictionaries often include alternative spellings, **pick the main entry** (e.g., _raccoon_ and _dexterous_) **rather than a variation**. If two or more spellings have separate entries, variations (e.g., _racoon_ and _dextrous_) are always identified either by the word "also" or by the abbreviation "var."

**If the preferred entry isn't clear, consult the separate Canadian Oxford Spelling Dictionary** (CBCNews.ca's national newsroom has a copy).

_NOTE: Only a limited number of CBC employees can use the online version of the Canadian Oxford at the same time. If you're denied access because "the maximum number of concurrent user sessions" has been reached, try again a few minutes later. **And please remember to LOG OUT when you're finished.**_


**Geographical names**
**For the names of Canadian places** you're not 100 per cent certain about (cities, towns, villages, lakes, rivers, etc.), **consult the** **[Canadian Geographical Names Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf)** published by Natural Resources Canada. For guidelines on when provincial names are required for context, see [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities).

**For communities outside of Canada, we normally follow entrenched English spellings used by CP and AP unless there's a compelling editorial reason to diverge.** Exceptions to CP and AP are listed in our Language Guide, along with some proper nouns that are being spelled inconsistently. 

While the Canadian Press and Associated Press are usually good guides for anglicized forms of foreign communities (Rome, not Roma), be aware that some preferred transliterations have changed since the breakup of the old [Soviet Union](/home/s/soviet-union) (e.g., it's _Chornobyl_ and _Kyiv_  not _Chernobyl_ or _Kiev_  because the former transliterations are based on Ukrainian while the latter are closer to Russian.) See [cities around the world](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld) as well as the [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations) overview.

**The National Geographic Atlas of the World can be helpful, but always check the CBC Language Guide for spelling exceptions** (e.g., we write Athens, Copenhagen, Munich, Nuremberg, Taipei, Venice and Warsaw based on established English convention). For guidelines on when country names are required for context, see [cities around the world](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld).


**Stylistic latitude** (B.C. Place, not 'BC Place')



**IMPORTANT: Logos, graphics, building banners, etc., do NOT automatically represent the definitive spellings of proper nouns in our journalism.** For example, "**CBC News**" is not "CBCnews" or "cbcnews," even though such versions may be found in CBC-sanctioned promotional material (e.g., posters, T-shirts, coffee mugs, TV advertisements), and "**B.C. Place**" is not "BC Place," regardless of the stadium signage. **It's a myth that all typography must be matched verbatim to maintain the principle of accuracy**. That's because some spelling decisions by governments, companies, community groups, etc., simply reflect stylistic preferences and branding choices. In Britain, for instance, it's common to see references to the "U.K."without periods, even on official websites (e.g., as the "UK House of Lords," conventionally written as the "**U.K. House of Lords**" in North America). **We'd open ourselves up to the chaotic whims of third parties if we insisted on reproducing each external source's typographical style** — from all lowercase or all uppercase renderings to unorthodox punctuation — especially since such choices can change overnight, and may not be used consistently across a given organization. In a world where it's OK to recast the "Republic of Korea" as "[South Korea](/home/s#SouthKorea)" for editorial reasons, it's illogical to become obsessed with the fact that the proprietary term "[Teleprompter](/home/q/quirky-capitalization)" was actually registered with the bizarre spelling of "TelePrompTer," that the "B.C. Coroner's Act" refers to "BC Coroners Services" (which we write as "**B.C. Coroners Services**"), or that a Prince Edward Island Crown corporation calls itself the "PEI Liquor Control Commission" (a name we write as the "**P.E.I. Liquor Control Commission**" for consistency). See [**Geographical components of proper nouns**](/home/a/abbreviations#propernouns-geocomponents) for additional examples and detailed guidelines.


**Transcribed speech: 'going to' vs. 'gonna'**
**Prefer standard English when typing quotes,** such "I'm going to see you later" instead of "I'm gonna see ya later." Colloquialisms such as "gonna" are reserved for a dash of local dialect or colour in features, but should be used only if accurate and never to make someone look uneducated.

**Some terms such as "gotcha" have become informal words in their own right. But they should be used only if they truly reflect what was said.** There's a big difference between someone hurriedly saying "I got you that book," and someone else pausing, grinning and then distinctly uttering "gotcha."

**Always give speakers the benefit of the doubt when a word is slightly mispronounced,** as long as the slip is obvious. For more details, see [Pronunciations (gonna, gotcha, etc.)](/home/q/quotes-editing#gonna) in the general guidelines on [editing quotes](/home/q/quotes-editing).


**Beware: Homophones can cause headaches**
It's worth noting that **some of the most common spelling errors are homophones** (words with different meanings that sound virtually the same), such as [arrant and errant](/home/a#arrant), [borne and born](/home/b#born) and [reign and rein](/home/r/reign-versus-rein). For a humorous look at some of the early mistakes we made as a broadcaster turned web publisher, see the 2006 column, [CBC learns to spell](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2F10th%2Fcolumns%2Fcbclearnstospell_blairshewchuk.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw108c0exPOO6qpWk-3zZF4N), which was posted on the 10th anniversary of CBC.ca. The piece's use of e-mail instead of [email](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens#email) reflects the ever-evolving nature of typography.


**Suggesting an entry, requesting a spelling**
CBC News journalists should always take the time to confirm the proper spellings of nouns in their stories, such as the names of people, organizations, medical terms and other technical jargon.

If one or more words are being frequently misspelled in scripts, let us know so we can add an entry to the Language Guide. Also, email us if a preferred spelling is unclear and a ruling is required for consistency. In either case, go to the [contact us](/contact-us) page and send a note to the standards editor.

### our common "our" spellings

**Lingering ligatures**

The last four letters of **queue** are arguably dispensable, illustrating the sometimes whimsical, if not utterly illogical, conventions that underpin various English spellings. **Depending on the sentence,** in fact, **superfluous vowels and consonants can seem to be the rule rather than the exception** — from the "k" in **knife**, the "w" in **two**, and the "t" in **listen**, to the "gh" in **weight**, the "ue" in **tongue**, and the "p" and "h" in **psychology**.

Into this chaos waddle a couple of old diagraphs, **"ae" and "oe,"** originally **bound as single characters in the early days of publishing** and, so, dubbed **"ligatures"** — i.e., letters tied together by printers to match old-style handwriting. These once common pairings gave us spellings like "**oeconomics**," "**praemium**" and "**tragoedy**" for what we now know as economics, premium and tragedy.

Virtually all true ligatures yoked in unique typeset glyphs have been discarded and forgotten, outside of esoteric journals in fusty corners of academia. But **a few of the original spellings live on** in spirit as inseparable vowels, **often by choice** (e.g., "**archaeology**" instead of "archeology"). **but occasionally as the only orthodox version** (e.g., **subpoena, oeuvre,** and **onomatopoeia**).

American and British journalists have comparatively little difficulty dealing with what amount to optional ligatures. The former tend to ignore them (cesarean, eon, estrogen) while the latter tend to embrace them (caesarean, aeon, oestrogen). Wandering between these camps, **Canadian media frequently, but not always, go with the shorter spellings common in the U.S.**

**CBC News style**, in bold on the left, **reflects this distinctly Canadian mix** of preferences, based on a review of numerous authoritative sources, including the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, CP Caps and Spelling, and Editing Canadian English published by the Editors' Association of Canada:

**aegis** — not _egis_
**amoeba** — not _ameba_
**anemia** — not _anaemia_
**anesthetic** — not _anaesthetic_
**archaeology** — not _archeology_ **\***
**caesarean** — not _cesarean_
**caesar salad** — not _cesar salad_
**diarrhea** — not _diarrhoea_
**encyclopedia** — not _encyclopaedia_ **^**
**eon** — not _aeon_
**esophagus** — not _oesophagus_
**esthetics** — not _aesthetics_
**estrogen** — not _oestrogen_
**feces** — not _faeces_
**fetid** — not _foetid_
**hemophilia** — not _haemophilia_
**hemorrhage** — not _haemorrhage_
**manoeuvre** — not _maneuver_
**medieval** — not _mediaeval_
**pediatrics** — not _paediatrics_
**pedophile** — not _paedophile_
**paleontology** — not _palaeontology_
**paleolithic** — not _palaeolithic_

**\*** = **Archaeology differs from CP style.** This "ae" spelling was **adopted by CBC News in November 2022** after public feedback from several academics who stressed that most archaeologists in North America still use the ligature, including members of the **Canadian Archaeological Association** and the **Archaeological Institute of America**. The same spelling is found at virtually all Canadian universities, and at Parks Canada heritage sites. Furthermore, the 2004 Oxford Canadian Spelling manual specifically recommends keeping the "ae" in "archaeology" while simultaneously discouraging it in "encyclopedia" and "paleontology," based on a review of a database of more than 8,000 Canadian publications, from newspapers and magazines to novels and works of non-fiction.

**^** = Exceptions are made for names reported as capitalized proper nouns. For example, the **Canadian Encyclopedia** versus the **Encyclopaedia Britannica**, and the Canadian Association of Aesthetic Medicine versus the government of Alberta's publication Health Standards and Guidelines for Esthetics.


**Canadian preferences**
**As noted in the Canadian Encyclopedia**, and quoted in our [Avoid inapt Americanisms](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/americanisms/ "Americanisms") overview:

_"**The main characteristic of Canadian spelling is the absence of any consistent pattern**, with choices between American and British forms varying by word, context, publication, genre, region and social group."_

**We get occasional audience letters about missing ligatures**. The feedback, which has included more than one formal complaint to the ombudsman, usually accuses us of ignorance and inaccuracy. **Our typical response: Many words can be spelled in more than one way.** So it's not not wrong to go with, say, medieval with an "ie" instead of an "iae." Rather, it's **an in-house style preference** between competing versions. **The key for us is to pick an established spelling widely used in Canada and to stick with it for consistency. We must also be ready to drop a lingering ligature as usage evolves** (e.g., in the 1990s, Canadian [anesthesiologists](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/anesthesiologist-versus-anesthetist/ "Anesthesiologist versus anesthetist") got rid of the "ae" in their professional society's name).

At the end of the day, a few truths should be remembered: **A lot of English spelling is highly subjective and wildly idiosyncratic**, and **Canadian English, in particular, is known for its novel amalgamation of British and U.S. spellings**. Experience suggests that people blasting us for writing, say, **hemorrhage** instead of "haemorrhage" might, themselves, never write "aeons ago" for **eons ago**, or stomach "oesophagus" for **esophagus**. So like cherries off a tree, ligatures tend to be handpicked by folks who simply think that certain familiar "ae" and "oe" pairings look good and feel right.

### Modified CP Style

**Web publishing: Why a 'modified' CP style?**

We're known as Canada's public broadcaster. But we've also become a publisher in a very big way, with a lot of text posted on our various websites and other digital platforms every day. There are many popular guides to written English (e.g., Strunk and White, Fowler's, the Chicago Manual of Style). Choosing one helps us stay consistent in our online journalism. **In the late 1990s, CBC News picked the Canadian Press Stylebook as our primary reference manual for typography** (spelling, capitalization, punctuation, etc.). **Although we've since established our own publishing style, CP remains a major influence.
**


**The CP Stylebook**
The Canadian Press's approach is sound. It's similar to the paths taken by AP, Reuters and other wire services that we deal with on a daily basis. This is helpful. On top of that, CP adopts a "Canadian" approach where appropriate (_labour_ not _labor_, for instance, and _half-mast_ not _half-staff_). Many of these preferences were already entrenched at the CBC long ago.

The CP Stylebook, which is about 500 pages thick, covers in highly useful detail thousands of minute matters that crop up when you're writing and editing words that other people will see. ("Is there an extra period in an ellipsis when it falls at the end of a complete sentence?" she asked. "An ellipsis?" he replied. "I'm not sure....")

At the turn of the century, most journalists filing web stories on a regular basis kept a copy of the manual nearby to stay on top of rules like that. Since 2003, however, the CBC News Language Guide has been our main resource, instead. It goes beyond the basics to tackle even relatively obscure topics, including the answer to the ellipsis question about an extra period raised in the previous paragraph (which is Rule C on the [ellipsis page](/handy-links/punctuation/ellipses)).


**Exceptions to CP**
Although CP remains a primary reference for typography, **as pointed out in the [CBC News Style](/cbc-news-style) overview, the corporation sets its own policies on editorial content and presentation**. We cannot operate effectively if writers and editors feel they're obligated to follow every "rule" or preference written down by some other organization.

There are **four primary reasons for diverging from CP style from time to time:**

**1\. Sometimes CP's language clashes with CBC News policy.**

In the 2003 Caps and Spelling, CP added an entry on Sept. 11, which it described as an acceptable term to refer to the "day of terrorist attacks in the United States." But CBC News does not call these "[terrorist attacks](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism)" without attribution.


**2\. Sometimes we think CP is wrong.**

We're all fallible. But when typos and other mistakes get published in Caps and Spelling they're not usually corrected for at least two years. The CBC News Language Guide, by comparison, can be revised within seconds. In 2003, for example, The Canadian Press misspelt the first and last names of Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin. CP didn't fix the mistakes ("-ly" and "-lan") until August 2005. And the 2007 Caps and Spelling transposed two letters in a new entry on the Tlicho First Nation (which was published as "Tilcho").


**3\. Sometimes we think CP is out of date.**

Just before the 2007 Caps and Spelling was published, the name of BCE Inc. was officially changed to Bell Canada Inc. But the new noun didn't make it into the new book. And in 2000, the "Guinness Book of Records" changed its name to the "Guinness World Records" book. But CP still listed the old (incorrect) title in its 2003 Caps and Spelling. The Canadian Press finally fixed the mistake in 2005 when the next edition of its manual was published. (See [Guinness Book of Records](/home/g/guinness-world-records)) CBCNews.ca, on the other hand, adopted both changes right away. And in 2018, we adopted the Tsuut'ina Nation's revised (fused) spelling of its name. But the change didn't appear in the online version of CP's Caps and Spelling until 2021. 


**4\. Sometimes we disagree with CP's choice.**

The 2005 Caps and Spelling, for instance, listed EBay, IPod and ITunes — which we have always written as [eBay, iPod and iTunes](/home/q/quirky-capitalization). (In mid-2008, CP revised its style to eBay, iPod and iTunes as well.) For years, The Canadian Press recommended 9-11 as the shorthand form for Sept. 11, 2001, for years. (We prefer the more common [9/11](/home/s#Sept11).) Until 2016, CP clung to the tradition of putting the title Cardinal between a person's first and last name (e.g., Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte), even though many news services, including CBC, had abandoned the style a decade earlier. We've gone with [Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte](/home/c#cardinal) since 2005. And CP has followed AP's spelling of "archeology" for years, even though there's strong evidence that the preferred Canadian version includes the "ae" ligature. We switched to [archaeology](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/spelling/lingering-ligatures/ "Lingering ligatures") in November of 2022 after reviewing evidence submitted in public complaints.

There are **several other important reasons to have our own central repository of language rulings:**

-   _Sometimes CP does not deal with a term._

Over the years, countless entries have been added to the CBC News Language Guide before they've appeared in the next edition of Caps and Spelling — from CT scan, Type 1 diabetes, grow-ops and BlackBerrys to PricewaterhouseCoopers, EpiPen and N.L. (instead of Nfld. for [Newfoundland and Labrador](/home/n/newfoundland-and-labrador)).

Foreign names of people or organizations suddenly in the news fall into this category as well. Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, for instance, didn't appear in CP's updated Caps and Spelling until the summer of 2003, almost two years after the Sept. 11 attacks. The entry read: "al-Qaida," which was AP's preference. CBCNews.ca, the BBC and many others adopted a different transliteration. (See [Arabic names](/home/a/arabic-names))

-   _Sometimes CP is incomplete._

The 2009 Caps and Spelling tells you how to spell Richter scale, but doesn't warn you not to use it. The larger stylebook merely cautions against automatically assuming that seismologists mean "Richter." The CBC, Globe and Mail, New York Times and numerous other organizations, however, recommend not using "Richter" at all. (See [earthquakes](/home/e/earthquakes))

-   _Sometimes CP is inconsistent._

The 2007 Caps and Spelling listed breakdancing and weeklong on some pages but "break dancing" and "week-long" on others. Similar slips occurred in past editions, such as paralyzing and shotgun in the book's main P and S indexes and "paralysing" and "shot-gun" elsewhere (under separate entries on mace and guns respectively).

See [Canadian Press](/home/c/cpap) for guidelines on the distinctions between "The Canadian Press" (as a noun), "the Canadian Press" (as an adjective), and "the Canadian Press Stylebook" (as the title of a manual).


**Exceptions are just that**
We frequently turn to the Canadian Press Stylebook, just as we consult the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (our main source for spellings), the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (for the spelling of communities in this country) and the National Geographic Atlas of the World (our main source for spots outside of Canada) — as pointed out in the **[spelling overview](/home/s/spelling).**

**We resist abandoning CP preferences on a whim.** This would leave our writers and editors struggling to keep up with the latest rulings, and defeat the purpose of trying to have a consistent style.

**But we reserve the freedom to take our own path.** Often our choices reflect approaches that we think are simpler for our journalists (e.g., sticking with the one spelling of [whisky](/home/w/whisky) rather than embracing CP's 2007 decision to start using "whiskey" in certain cases) as well as easier for our audience (e.g., rejecting CP's move to "US$550" from $550 US because we considered the fused [currency](/home/m/money) construction harder to read on the web).

As the years pass, CBC News style steadily expands and becomes more established. **We have already stopped consulting the CP Caps and Spelling manual on a regular basis since our own electronic Language Guide is far more current and comprehensive.** Although the list of exceptions gradually grows, the main Canadian Press Stylebook remains our primary external reference for typographical guidance. **In short, we follow a modified CP style when publishing text.**

### our common "our" spellings

**Our common 'our' spellings**

**We often use "our" at the ends of words that Americans prefer to spell "or."

But writers must be careful when a suffix is added.** In these cases, **the original "u" sometimes disappears:**

arbour _but_ arborist, arboretum
ardour
armour
behaviour
candour
clamour
clangour
colour \*(_but see_ [**colour/color**](/home/s/spelling/our#colour) _below_)
demeanour
discolour
dishonour
enamour
endeavour
favour
fervour
flavour
glamour _but_ glamorous
harbour
honour, honourable, honouree _but_ honorary
humour _but_ humorous _and_ humorist
labour _but_ laborious
Labour Day
neighbour
odour _but_ odorous
parlour
rancour _but_ rancorous
rigour _but_ rigorous
rumour
saviour
savour
splendour
tumour _but_ tumorous
valour _but_ valorous
vapour _but_ vaporous _and_ vaporize
vigour _but_ vigorous

**The following words always have "or" endings** (on both sides of the Atlantic):

actor
ambassador
bachelor
emperor
error
governor
horror
liquor
mirror
orator
pallor
sailor
stupor
terror
tremor


**Colour versus color**
**In the case of proper nouns, we generally adopt the original spelling** (e.g., **Technicolor**, which is a registered [trademark](/home/t/trade-names), the movie _The **Color** Purple_, and the U.S. organization "the National Association for the Advancement of **Colored** People"). For exceptions, see [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre)


See also [spelling](/home/s/spelling) (an overview), as well as [Avoid inapt Americanisms](/home/a/americanisms)

### split decision

**Split decision**

**Appeal courts render two types of decisions:
**

> **1\. UNANIMOUS** (all judges on the panel agree)
>
> **2\. SPLIT** (one or more judges on the panel disagree)


**Avoid "non-unanimous,"** which is non-standard English. In addition to being jarring and unorthodox, the term can be misheard in broadcast scripts as "unanimous."

**Within almost every split ruling there is a majority decision and a minority or dissenting decision.** But it's potentially confusing to label the overall, divided ruling (e.g., 7-2, 4-1), itself, a "majority decision." Instead, the majority decision is only part of the overall split decision.


**Prefer precise breakdowns in headlines, bulletins** (e.g., 8-1, 5-4-, 4-1, 3-2)
The expression "split decision" was originally used in boxing. It has since become common in legal circles. **"Split" is a vague modifier in both fields. It applies regardless of the division** (e.g., 8-1, 7-2-, 6-3-, 5-4). The **Canadian Oxford Dictionary's definition reflects this:**


> _SPLIT DECISION (noun) 1. A decision in a boxing match in which the judges and referees are **not unanimous** in their choice of a winner; 2. A court ruling etc., which is **not unanimous.**_


Denotation and connotation are sometimes are odds, however, **The traditional definition of "split decision" can cause confusion** among people who assume "split" refers only to "evenly divided" (4-4, 3-3) or to "closely divided" (5-4-, 4-3, 3-2) decisions. **This misunderstanding has prompted more than one audience complaint** about our coverage of court cases over the years.

**In first reference, therefore, it's generally better to use specific breakdowns** (e.g., 4-1 or 7-2) **rather than to rely on vague modifiers like "split" or "divided"** — **especially in news bulletins and headlines,** The following tweets illustrate how precise numbers better convey relevant detail:


> (i) _BREAKING NEWS: In a split decision, Ontario's top court has upheld the ..._
>
> (ii) _BREAKING NEWS: In a 4-1 decision, Ontario's top court has upheld the ..._ 


Version (i) is accurate but also potentially confusing to members of our audience who may infer that "split" means a closer ruling.

**Version (ii) is preferred.** It's clearer and slightly shorter, which makes it better **in the constrained space of a news alert.**


### split infinitives

**Split infinitives**

You can’t split an infinitive in Latin, because it’s one word — e.g., amare (to love) and crescere (to grow).

But **you can** (are able to) **and may** (are allowed to) **split infinitives in English**. Even some of the more conservative grammarians concede this point.


**What’s an infinitive?**
An infinitive is a type of verb that's in the "infinite mood" — a term grammarians use to describe words that indicate action without specifying who's involved (e.g., the first or third person), the number involved (plural or singular), and the time involved (past, present, or future tense).

In the last sentence, for instance, "to describe" is an infinitive: "They had hoped _to_ _describe_," "I will try _to describe_," "She won't be able _to describe_," and so on. "Full infinitives" always include the word _to_, while "bare infinitives" do not.


**How do you split it?**
**If you put something** (usually an adverb) **between the particle to and the verb** (e.g., _go_) **you are said to have "split the infinitive"** (_to boldly go_). The modern-day expression has been around only since the late 1800s, although the rule against splitting infinitives was actually concocted by some intolerant grammarians hundreds of years earlier.


**Why split it?**
Sometimes slipping an adverb in the middle of the infinitive can soften a thought, emphasize an idea or improve a sentence's rhythm. Common examples include "to more than double" and "to really understand."

Writers and editors do not have to put the structure of the infinitive above the needs of the adverb. **As long as the wording is natural and the sentence’s meaning is clear, feel free to split.**

For a longer discussion, see the Words: Woe & Wonder column [To Boldly Split Infinitives](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Finfinitives.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw33al-1Ysa7Jrb_ra02Fhja)

See also [grammar](/handy-links/grammar) for a list of common topics, including [prepositions at the end of sentences](/home/p/prepositions-at-the-end-of-sentences)

### spokeperson

**Spokesperson, spokeswoman, spokesman**

**The entrenched word "spokesperson" is preferred** because it's a common and acceptable way to avoid a sexist suffix.


> _A company spokesperson said power should be restored by midnight._
> _A spokesperson said the ad agency has not received any complaints about the billboard._


Be aware that some of the people we interview continue to prefer specific rather than generic forms in their titles. **While we do not ban use of "spokesman" or "spokeswoman," standard guidelines about accuracy and parallel construction apply**. In particular:

-   Never assume that someone speaking on behalf of a company or organization is a man.
-   Do not call women "spokesmen."
-   Avoid the inconsistency of always calling a man a "spokesman" while referring to a woman as a "spokesperson."

**Given the above caveats, it's generally best to use spokesperson across the board**, regardless of whether the word "spokesman" or "spokeswoman" appears in a given individual's title.

See also [chair](/home/c/chair) (chairman, chairwoman, etc.)

### sports overview

**Sports overview**

**CBCSports.ca's preferences are listed in this site's main alphabetical directory** (the A to Z boxes at the top and bottom of this page).

For instance, we write _goalmouth_ but _goal line_, and _Grand Slam_ in stories about certain tennis events but _grand slam_ in baseball.

**Some entries are exceptions to CP style** (e.g., _five-pin_ bowling rather than _fivepin_ bowling, and our preference for _AA_ and _AAA_ instead of _double-A_ and _triple-A_).

For convenience, many common terms can also be found clustered under the following headings:

### spree

**Spree**

**OK to describe a bout of frivolous or non-violent behaviour**, from sudden splurges to certain unlawful activity.


> buying spree
> shopping spree
> spending spree
>
> building spree
> expansion spree
> takeover spree
>
> crime spree — (_NON-VIOLENT_)
> shoplifting spree — (_NON-VIOLENT_)
> vandalism spree — (_NON-VIOLENT_)


**But do not use in the context of violence** unless attributed (e.g., in a transcribed clip).


> killing spree — (_AVOID_)
> murder spree — (_AVOID_)
> shooting spree — (_AVOID_)


**The word is too breezy to mean "rampage" or "assault"** — introducing what can be easily perceived as a disrespectful and unsuitably cavalier tone in stories about bloodshed, death, etc.


**Background**

"Spree" was coined in the early 1800s. The noun originally meant extravagant or reckless indulgence, as well as riotous merrymaking, especially binge-drinking. This sense remained entrenched for almost two centuries. In the 1980s, "spree" started being used in the U.S. to describe multiple murders committed by the same person within a brief time period (e.g., "spree killings"). This usage has been controversial for decades, however, given the word's strong association with lively, lighthearted romps.

Some people broadly use "spree" to mean any outburst of activity or frenzied sequence of events (e.g., "shooting spree" is now listed in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary). But this practice offends segments of our audience, based on the complaints we periodically receive. Given this reality, and the fact that different, equally conversational phrasing is readily available (e.g., "shooting rampage"), **there's no editorial merit in characterizing a series of violent attacks as a "spree."**

CBC News adopted the above guidelines in April 2020.

### st saint ste

**St., Saint, St-, Sainte, Ste-**

[Canonization title](/home/s/st-saint-ste#canonization) (St. Paul, St. Joseph, St. Anne)
[Other proper nouns](/home/s/st-saint-ste#otherpropernouns) (surnames, cities, rivers, etc.)
[St. John River](/home/s/st-saint-ste#StJohnRiver) (New Brunswick)

**Canonization title**
**The generic word saint is lowercase:**

> She was declared a saint in 1982.
>
> He's the first Canadian to become a saint this century.


**As a title before the names of people canonized, the abbreviation St. is used for men and women** (rather than St. and Ste.), based on standard English spelling.

> St. André Bessette
>
> St. Marguerite Bourgeoys


Unless a historical figure is well known (St. Peter, St. Christopher, St. Francis of Assisi), surnames are normally included in first reference.

See also [Father, Mother, Sister, Brother](/home/f/father-mother-brother-sister) for related guidelines (e.g., St. Brother André Bessette)


**Other proper nouns** (surnames, cities rivers, etc.)
**In Quebec proper nouns, the abbreviations for Saint and Sainte do not generally have periods and are followed by hyphens** (St-Jean-Baptiste Day and Montreal’s Ste-Catherine Street). In the names of communities, the **abbreviations St- and Ste- are frequently used**, such as Ste-Anne-des-Monts. But in people’s names, **Saint or Sainte may also be spelled out** (Raymond Saint-Gelais, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Chloé Sainte-Marie).

In the rest of Canada, it’s rare to encounter St- or Ste- without periods in the name of a city, town or village. But there is still a wide range of possibilities. **Never assume spellings.** (It’s Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, for instance, but St. Marys, Ont.) Here are a few more examples:

[St. John’s](/home/s/st-saint-ste#StJ) (in Newfoundland and Labrador)
[Saint John](/home/s/st-saint-ste#SaintJ) (in New Brunswick)
Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.
Saint-Antoine, N.B.
Sainte-Marie among the Hurons (historical site near Midland, Ont.)

Outside of Canada, all bets are off. **Follow the North American convention of adding a period to the abbreviation "St." even when different typography is used abroad** (e.g., **St. Andrews, Scotland** instead of "St Andrews," Scotland). We also add periods to abbreviations such as "Dr." and "Mr." (instead of the British spellings, "Dr" and "Mr"). Proper nouns like St. Andrews require care. In Canada for instance, "St." might be spelled out in a virtually identical town's name (e.g., **Saint Andrews, N.B.**). Neither version features a possessive apostrophe.

Check all names you’re not 100 per cent sure about. **If you can’t find a reliable spelling, don’t guess. Leave the proper noun out of the story.**

Some correct or common and recommended "St." preferences can be found at the [**top of S index**](/home/s#top).


**St. John River**
**In rare cases, geographical names are known by more than one spelling.** We generally follow the Natural Resources Canada [official list](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf) of domestic cities, towns, villages, lakes, mountains, etc. But **when a local preference has clearly become entrenched** (e.g., the St. John River instead of the "Saint John River" in New Brunswick), **we adopt this conventional spelling if there's other official support for it** (e.g., the provincial government often uses St. John River).

For consistency, we need to extend such exceptions (St. John River) to any proper nouns tied to that specific geographical name (e.g., the **St. John River Forecast Centre** rather than the "Saint John River Forecast Centre"), in the same way that we put a "c" in the U.S. [Department of Defence](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) to maintain a consistent in-house style. But this does NOT mean altering any other proper nouns (e.g., it's still the **Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority**).

**CBC News style has been St. John River for decades, based on a recommendation from CBC New Brunswick journalists.** This spelling was last reviewed and reaffirmed in May 2019. We periodically receive emails from people who insist that the only correct spelling is "Saint John River." However, historical records show that both versions have been used for hundreds of years. There's also evidence that "St. John River" is the original spelling, appearing on maps from the 1600s. A non-profit organization that champions good stewardship of the waterway continues to call itself the [St. John River Society](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stjohnriver.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3yW43u0UiGbnrrB6jknrAV). And in the summer of 1993, Canada Post issued a 43-cent "St. John River" stamp, honouring it as one of the country's "five most important heritage rivers."


**Louis St-Laurent**
**Sometimes people are known by more than one spelling.** An example is former prime minister Louis Stephen St-Laurent, also known to many as Louis Saint-Laurent. The Library of Parliament refers to him as "Saint-Laurent" and "St-Laurent" on the same web page. The Globe and Mail recommends the English form "Louis St. Laurent." CP preferred "Louis Saint-Laurent" until 2005, when it switched to St-Laurent.

**CBC.ca now prefers "Louis St-Laurent" too.** It’s consistent with the National Library of Canada’s archives as well as with the spelling that appears in so many tributes to the former prime minister (e.g., the Louis St-Laurent National Historic Park at his hometown of Compton, Que., and the Louis St-Laurent government building in Gatineau, Que.).

### State of the union

**State of the union**

No hyphens or capital letters.

In the United States, the president is required by law to give [Congress](/home/c/congress) updates "from time to time." They're usually delivered every January nowadays, but do not have to be.

**The state of the union message** is the _president's written report_ to Congress. This is the term used for the document that's actually delivered.

**The state of the union address** (also known as **the state of the union speech**) is the related _spoken version_. Although some people also call the speech a message, the New York Times and many other news outlets continue to distinguish between the spoken and the written word.


**Use state of the union address**
**In first reference, CBC News style is _state of the union address_** because this is generally what we're covering (i.e., the president's address to Congress and the nation).

In second reference, it can also be called a _speech_ or the president's _message_ (since these nouns on their own are generic terms).

The text of every state of the union speech or written message since 1790 is available on the University of California's website: [The American Presidency Project](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanpresidency.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1rdGxOxr8SvzAFp78QOiqq)

### Station

**Station versus station**

**Capitalize the names of a few well-known railway stations because they're considered important buildings:
**
Grand Central Station
Union Station

**But use lowercase "station" when the noun simply refers to a particular community, street or railway system:**

the Finch subway station
the Oakville GO station
Ottawa's train station
a Via Rail station

See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines

### Suicide

**Suicide**

**CBC News does not routinely report suicides. If a death is newsworthy, however, the cause of death is relevant.**


> **Example:** In 2002, British weapons expert David Kelly killed himself after being identified as the source of BBC reports accusing the U.K. government of exaggerating evidence to justify military action against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Comprehensive coverage of the original story, as well as the inquiry and findings (known as the Hutton report) the next year, would have been impossible without reference to suicide.


The rest of this entry is intended to supplement the corporation's general [Journalistic Standards and Practices policy on suicide coverage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fcrime-and-police-reporting-faits-divers-1.4523145&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2mm8TbQXX61Da1Th2qvUQV) by offering specific direction on the structure and wording of news stories:

[Mentioning suicide in headlines](/home/s/suicide#unusualcases) (i.e., unusual or unavoidable cases)


[Specific wording](/home/s/suicide#specificwording) (e.g., killed himself, took her own life, committed suicide)

(For stories about grievously and irremediably ill people seeking aid to end their lives, see [**assisted dying**](/home/a/assisted_dying), which **has largely replaced the term "assisted suicide"** in Canada.)

**Generally avoid reference to suicide in headlines
**When reporting on a specific suicide, **the death should normally be the story's focus rather than the cause. This usually means avoiding reference to suicide in the headline:** _Alberta MP Jones dies at 58 rather than Alberta MP Jones kills himself or Alberta MP's death a suicide._


> **Example:** In September 2009, the Quebec writer Nelly Arcan killed herself, only eight years after her first, award-winning book Putain (_Whore_) was published. She had just finished writing a new novel that centred on suicide. Her death was the focus of the story. The cause of death (suicide) was not mentioned in the headline or lead:
>
> **Headline:** Quebec writer Nelly Arcan dies at 35
>
> **Lead:** Celebrated Quebec writer Nelly Arcan was found dead in her Montreal apartment late Thursday evening. She was 35 years old.
>
> **Fourth paragraph:** A spokesperson for her publishing house Coup de Tête, Myriam Comtois, confirmed Arcan's death, but refused to elaborate on what might have caused it. But Montreal police said Friday they are treating it as a suicide.


**One of the concerns is copycat behaviour.** Mental health professionals refer to this as "suicide contagion." Research suggests that some vulnerable people may be prompted to take their own lives if the deaths of others are covered in a certain way by the media. And emphasizing suicide in a headline can inadvertently sensationalize or romanticize the act, the experts warn. 

 
**Mentioning suicide in headlines: Unusual or unavoidable cases**
**There are times when the cause of death may merit special prominence in the lead or headline. For example, if a suicide involves a public figure** or someone else who's already in the news **and moves a top story in an entirely different direction** (e.g., _Toronto teacher facing sex charges commits suicide_). A mass suicide (e.g., Jonestown in 1978) or a murder-suicide may also require emphasis on the cause of death, depending on the facts and what serves the audience best.

**Just because a death takes place in public** (e.g., someone jumping in front of subway train), **however, does not automatically mean the suicide should be mentioned in the headline or lead.** When in doubt, check with your supervisor.


**Don't speculate about cause of death or motive**

**Never presume that people have taken their own lives simply because it appears to be a suicide.** If authorities say someone died of a drug overdose, the possibilities could range from accidental to intentional death — including at someone else's hands. And **be cautious when reporting on "attempted suicides" and potentially unlawful "assisted deaths"** (e.g., when there's a dispute over whether "medical assistance in dying" eligibility requirements were met). If charges are possible or a case is before the courts, certain wording could be prejudicial. Check with the Law Department if uncertain.

**Never jump to conclusions about the reason someone has committed suicide** (e.g., because she or he was molested in the past). There may be many factors. Report facts that are known, but don't speculate about motive.


**Privacy concerns**
**While stories about a specific suicide often involve a public figure** (Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Freddie Prinze), **this is not always the case. Relevant journalistic standards and practices** (e.g., [respecting privacy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fprivacy-1.4523423&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1UE2yZUVKjUPE2QtJEUFMz)) **should always be considered.**


> **Example:** In a story about bullying at school, the parents of a boy who hanged himself speak out. They want more done to stop bullying, and they want other parents to watch for signs of trouble that they missed. Concerns about violating a grieving family's privacy don't apply, since the mother and father have consented to talk about their loss. A public good is also identified: The parents believe that discussing their son's death may prevent other suicides.

**Specific wording**
**There are many ways to refer to suicide that are brief, factual and carry no judgment**, from _"She took her own life"_ to _"He killed himself."_

**Be aware that some people strongly object to the term "committed suicide."** They feel it unnecessarily suggests criminal behaviour (e.g., committed murder, committed fraud), and inaccurately portrays all people who kill themselves as being "committed to death" when many are actually very vulnerable and in need of help.

**CBC News does not ban the entrenched expression "committed suicide." But we recommend considering alternatives** such as those outlined above, **especially when referring to young people taking their own lives.** One approach is to recast the intransitive verb into a modified noun (e.g., instead of saying _"the number of teenagers committing suicide"_ you can write _"the number of teenage suicides"_). Another is to write "death by suicide," along the lines of "death by accident." Use your own judgment.

**Avoid glorifying or sensationalizing a death by painting a picture that's too colourful.** For example, reference to a suicide note may be worth including but lengthy excerpts from the note probably carry little editorial value. **Never use adjectives such as "successful" or "unsuccessful"** when reporting on suicides or attempted suicides.

**Be aware that terminology such as "depression" has a specific medical meaning.** It's not merely a synonym for sadness or moodiness. Major or clinical depression often involves feelings such as overwhelming hopelessness or emptiness, extremely low self-esteem, etc. There may be biological (e.g., brain chemistry), psychological or other causes. Factors like substance addiction can play a role. Research suggests that many people who commit suicide have a significant psychiatric illness that is undiagnosed and/or untreated.

**When reporting on suicide in general, including statistical trends, avoid terms such as "epidemic" that suggest a widespread pattern.** Instead, state that the suicide rate within a certain population (e.g., Canadians of a certain age, or in a specific region of the country) is up and down. The actual figures should be given and attributed to a named source.

Our [general guidelines on reporting death](/home/d/death-general-guidelines) list related advice (e.g., avoiding euphemisms, redundancies, sensational synonyms).

### suspect\_accused

**Suspect, accused, person of interest**

**NOTE:** This entry provides only general guidance based on Journalism and the Law workshops designed for CBC staff over the decades. If you have any legal questions, including doubts about the wording of a specific story, always consult a CBC lawyer before publishing or broadcasting.


To keep our journalism accurate and clear, **we distinguish between suspects and accused:**


> **SUSPECT** — Person police say is **suspected of a crime.** May or may not ever be charged.
> **ACCUSED** — Person **formally charged with a crime.**


These are entrenched definitions. NOTE: **Just because someone is arrested does NOT mean the word "accused" automatically applies.** The word "arrest" conventionally means detention by police. People who are arrested in Canada may be released a short time later without being charged.

**We also distinguish between convicted offenders and accused in custody** when reporting on jails and other detention facilities:


> **OFFENDER** — Person **convicted** of an offence.
> **INMATE or DETAINEE** — Person **held in custody**, including an accused remanded while awaiting a trial or other court appearance.


**Avoid wrongly implying that everyone locked up in a correctional facility has been convicted**. A 2020 pandemic story about a jail on the Prairies illustrates preferred wording. We should write something along the lines of "masks must be worn by all **_inmates_** and staff" rather than "masks must be worn by all _offenders_ and staff," since the latter version either ignores mask rules for individuals remanded in custody or wrongly implies they've been convicted of a crime.

NOTE: [Steer clear of terms such as "young offender"](/home/y#youthjustice) to describe an accused under 18.

**The words "suspect" and "accused" are attractive** because they help us report on crime neutrally, without stating or implying guilt. **But there are still pitfalls** to avoid. **The rest of this entry highlights three areas of confusion that sometimes surface in scripts:**

[1\. JSP caution:](/home/s/suspect_accused#JSP-caution) We routinely name accused but rarely name suspects
[2\. Stylistic reminder:](/home/s/suspect_accused#diction-reminder) Suspects have identities
[3\. Ambiguous labels require care](/home/s/suspect_accused#ambiguous-labels) (e.g., person of interest)

## **1\. JSP caution: We routinely name accused but rarely name suspects**

**The decision to name a suspect is governed by relevant CBC policy.** Our default practice: **We generally name an accused** unless doing so is unlawful (e.g., if a court order protects the identity because the person is a minor). **We do not usually name a suspect unless there's a compelling public interest** (e.g., when authorities are trying to capture someone they say is dangerous) . **Naming suspects requires the approval of a managing editor,** as outlined in relevant Journalistic Standards and Practices policy ([JSP: Identification of Persons Involved in Legal Proceedings](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fcourt-reporting-affaires-judiciaires-1.4523139&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw01yFlRiqp0Iw8F6esj3PLk)).

Limiting when we name suspects is a long-standing CBC News policy. **The mere act of reporting someone's identity can irrevocably damage the person's reputation.** A suspect may, in fact, never be charged. For example, investigators might change their minds after detaining someone for questioning. Or they might make a mistake (e.g., circulate the wrong name and photo of someone, only later to determine that the person they're actually after is someone else).

## **2\. Stylistic reminder: Suspects have identities**

"Suspect" has a relatively narrow meaning. **Before charges are laid, the word "suspect" applies when police:**

-   **Know the identity of someone they think committed a crime** but have simply not released the name (e.g., "the suspect was last seen ...").
-   **Release video or pictures of people they think committed a crime** (e.g.., "photos of the suspects") because the images are a form of identification.

Careful writers **avoid the common but nonsensical use of "suspect" as a generic synonym for unidentified wrongdoers.** It boils down to this: **Authorities cannot technically suspect anyone of a crime unless they actually know the person's identity.** Otherwise, they're simply referring to the unknown perpetrator of a crime (e.g., the robber, the assailant, the killer).


> EXAMPLES: In a news story about, say, a deadly school rampage, it's accurate to say "**the shooter fled the school**" but illogical to say "the suspect fled the school" unless the shooter's identity is known to police. The same applies to routine physical descriptions of people being sought. Instead of formulaically reporting that "the suspect is described as," consider more accurate, generic wording that applies to a given set of facts (e.g., "the **man is described as**" or "the **driver is described as**" or "the **robber is described as**").


Some writers like the broad term "perpetrator," which simply means criminal or wrongdoer (i.e., someone who carried out a given act, such as robbery, assault or murder). But the **downside of "perpetrator" is that it's lofty**. And while the clipped form "perp" is common in some circles, such slang can unintentionally change a story's overall tone — making it more unnatural than truly conversation, like outmoded dialogue lifted from a 1930s gangster film that refers to a police lineup as a "perp walk."

## **3\. Ambiguous labels require care (e.g., person of interest)**

**Be cautious with vague terminology** sometimes used by the police. Certain wording can be easily interpreted as the equivalent of "suspect."

For instance, **a "person of interest" may simply be a potential witness** — e.g., someone the authorities want to talk to because they think the individual might have information about a specific crime. Therefore, **try to nail down exactly what investigators mean by nebulous labels** (e.g., prefer "potential witness" over "person of interest" as long as authorities confirm that the clearer language is accurate in a given case).

**Avoid qualifying "person of interest" with waffling words like "possible"** (i.e., "possible person of interest"). Police either want to talk to someone or they don't. Be aware that detectives sometimes attempt to use media reports to ferret out folks as part of their process of elimination. If an editorial decision is made to report the identity of a "person of interest," based on our guiding JSP principles, never imply that the individual is an actual suspect.

### Station

**swastika**

This is the **common and acceptable name** for a **Nazi symbol** virtually everyone in our audience recognizes. The plural is **swastikas**.

Be aware that we receive complaints from time to time from people who object to this usage because of the word's Sanskrit origins ("to be good"), as well as its historic connections to Hinduism and other faiths and cultures. They prefer alternative labels, such as **gammadion** (which means four joined capital gammas, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet) or _**hakenkreuz**_ (which means "**hooked cross**" in German), or **fylfot** (which is an English relic from the 1500s for a type of cross featuring cramped ends, sometimes dubbed a **_cramponnée_**).

**But such alternatives are not nearly as well known to most of audience**, and, so, would generally need to be explained if included in a story. **Furthermore, gammadion, _hakenkreuz_ and fylfot are succinctly defined in most English dictionaries as swastikas**, reflecting more than a century of common usage — from documents published by governments and scholars to news releases from national and international Jewish organizations, such as B'nai Brith Canada and the [U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/history-of-the-swastika). It's worth noting that the Hindu American Foundation used the word "swastika" when it issued a joint statement with the American Jewish Committee in 2008 called, [The Swastika: Use and Abuse of a Sacred Symbol](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/mfpjslet/theswastika_use-and-abuse_haf-ajc_2008-brochure.pdf "Swastika-Use-And-Abuse-Brochure-2008-Statement").

As we've pointed out in more than one response to complaints sent to the CBC ombudsman over the years: **We use standard English in our reporting, diverging only when there's a compelling editorial reason** (e.g., when a word or phrase is indisputably inaccurate, misleading or biased). **The noun swastika, however, does not fall into this category**. Instead, it illustrates a reality of linguistics: Words with unrelated denotations or etymologies sometime take on new meanings in a different tongue over time.


### systemic\_systematic

**Systemic versus systematic**

There's a notable difference between systemic and systematic:


> **SYSTEMIC discrimination** commonly refers to inherent or **built-in biases that are real but less obvious** than blatant racism, sexism, etc.



> **SYSTEMATIC discrimination** commonly refers to **stark biases that are purposeful and undisguised.**


The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage puts it this way:


> _"**'Systemic discrimination'** has to do with **inequities and prejudices** within the operation of a system (the education system, etc.) **that are not overt or easy to locate**, but that are present nonetheless. For example, **a requirement that all firefighters be over six feet** tall could be seen as evidence of systemic discrimination against most women and, in some minority groups, most men as well.... To be **'systematic'** in your approach to a task is to make a plan and carry it out in a **thorough and orderly** way. Thus **'systematic discrimination'** and 'systematic racism' involve **not unconscious prejudice but deliberate acts of repression.** The **Nazis' treatment of the Jews** during the Second World War was an extreme example of 'systematic racism.' **Apartheid in South Africa** — an explicit government policy of exclusion of the basis of race — was another."_

> > — 2007 Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage


The choice of modifier depends on a given story's facts. But **in routine coverage of institutional discrimination, the word "systemic" normally applies**.


**Systemic racism**

Since at least the 1880s, the word "systemic" has had several meanings, including "throughout an entire system" as well as "inherent in the system," according to the Oxford English Dictionary. **Systemic racism is an umbrella term for built-in bias that's real but often subtle**. It's sometimes perpetuated by institutions because people are not mindful, and because traditional policies and practices are deeply entrenched.

**Although the expression "systematic racism" is familiar, its exact meaning is neither precisely defined nor instantly understood by all.** To illustrate shades of connotation, **consider these two complementary definitions** found in a 117-page House of Commons study into systemic racism in Canada published in 2018:


> _"People have a hard time understanding what systemic discrimination is and what systemic racism is. This is because it's not the kind of racism that comes necessarily from the behaviour, words, and actions of individuals, other than the fact that they are guided by the system in which they are functioning. The phrase that I always like to use is that **systemic racism is the racism that's left over after you get rid of the racists.** Once you get rid of the racists within the justice system, for example, you will still have racism perpetrated by the justice system. This is because the justice system follows certain rules, procedures, guidelines, precedents, and laws that are inherently discriminatory and racist because those laws, policies, procedures, processes, and beliefs — including beliefs that direct individuals on how and when to exercise their discretion — come from a history of the common law, which comes from a different culture, a different way of thinking."_

> > — Manitoba Senator Murray Sinclair



> _"**Systemic racism is often caused by conscious or unconscious biases in policies, practices and procedures** that privilege or disadvantage particular groups of people based on perceptions of race. It's not always intentional, but **whether or not it's intentional has little bearing on the inequitable outcomes** Indigenous and racialized people experience."_

Some audience members dispute that systemic racism exists in Canada. CBC News rejects such claims, which have come in various forms, including as official ombudsman complaints. Certain people may question the conventional meaning of "systemic racism." They may also contest whether it exists in their country's police forces, judicial system or other institutions. But just because they hold those positions or choose to define language in extremely narrow and unorthodox ways, does not mean that our use of the entrenched compound "systemic racism" is inaccurate, confusing, misleading or otherwise inappropriate when the facts fit. **Given Canada's history** — including the historical underrepresentation of Indigenous people and other non-white people in positions of wealth and power — **the existence of systemic racism is considered undeniable and unsurprising to many public figures today**. For example, in June 2020 [the RCMP's commissioner acknowledged that systemic racism exists within the force she leads](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fbrenda-lucki-systemic-racism-rcmp-1.5610355&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw17jpP2a_5RZHHZDHhIVY8W).

**Tahrir Square** (in downtown Cairo) It's acceptable to add the English translation as an aside once in a story.

**Taliban** (avoid alternative [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), such as "Taleban") The noun can be plural (_Taliban are_) or singular (_Taliban is_), depending on whether we're emphasizing group members or the group as a collective. For details, see [verb agreement](/home/v/verb-agreement#collectivenouns).

**Talmud** (The body of Jewish oral law and rabbinical teachings compiled between the third and sixth centuries. The word means "teaching" or "study" in Hebrew. It is not the same as the [Torah](/home/t#Torah).) See also [Shariah](/home/s#Shariah)

**Tamiflu** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for oseltamivir, an antiviral drug) See also [flu](/home/f/flu) for general guidelines on covering influenza.

**tariff**, _but_ **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**, etc.

**tarsands** (one word), but [use **oilsands**](/home/o/oilsands-versus-tarsands)

**Taser** (n., adj., and v.) The name of a gun designed to incapacitate people with an electric shock. Since the word is proprietary, it must be uppercase even as a verb ("Police Tasered him"), along the lines of Google ("They Googled themselves once a week"). See also [trade names](/home/t/trade-names). Taser is now widely known and, therefore, OK in first reference. But it's not always the best choice, especially if the weapon being reported on is not actually manufactured by Taser International Inc. A common, generic alternative is **stun gun**. Tasers are [electrical](/home/e#electrical) rather than electronic. Generally avoid the obscure abbreviation CEW unless you need to explain the jargon (e.g., transcribing a quote). In that case, spell it out as "conducted electrical weapon." Other definitions of CEW are sometimes used (e.g., the E is referred to as "energy"), but these forms are rarer, disputed and less meaningful to our audience. See [weapons](/home/w/weapons) for general guidelines about guns.

****tassel, tasselled*

*tastebuds****

**Tatar** (Turkic ethnic group in eastern Europe and parts of northern Asia) Prefer this spelling over the alternative, "Tartar," as in **Crimean Tatars**, a Tatar leader, Tatar culture, Muslim Tatars, etc.

****tattoo, tattooed****

**tax-free savings account** See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens) for general punctuation direction.

**TD Bank, TD Canada Trust** (see [banks](/home/b/banks) for guidelines)

**Tea Party movement** (U.S. political movement that gained national attention during a series of rallies in 2009) Supporters want much smaller government at all levels and lower taxes. Not all people who participate in Tea Party movement events are formal members of the modern [Boston Tea Party](/home/b#BostonTeaParty), founded in 2006. Political commentators have divided views of the Tea Party movement. Some consider it a growing grassroots campaign made up of anti-establishment patriots. Others dismiss it as a marginal group of mainly older, white, conservative activists — with some extremists in the mix — who are fed up with the mainstream political parties.

**teachers' union, teachers' strike** (See [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for details)

**team-building** (n. and adj.), as in focused on team-building, a team-building exercise

**teammate** (no hyphen)

**Teamsters union** (acceptable in all references to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America); **a teamster** (member of the union) _No_ [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) in _Teamsters union_

**tear gas** (two words)

**Technicolor** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names))

**technician** (generic) Conventionally refers to people who run and/or repair certain equipment (a computer technician, a mechanical technician); **technologist**; (technical specialists in a given field). For example, a **sonographer** is an **ultrasound technologist**. Be aware that use of the term "technologist" is governed by legislation in some jurisdictions. It often implies a professional status tied to a defined educational program or other credentials. The health-sector illustrates this distinction. **Medical technicians** may be trained to operate sophisticated lab equipment that produces complex results, but they're probably not qualified to interpret the scientific meaning of those results. By contrast, **medical technologists** do much more than operate equipment. They also calibrate/adjust as they go. This means that medical technologists usually need to know a lot about whatever part of the anatomy they're examining — sort of health-care detectives in search of the best evidence they can collect for doctors. Indeed, the quality of some medical exams can heavily depend on the skills of the technologist rather than merely on correct operation of the equipment. While there's no need to get bogged down in arcane jargon in stories, we should avoid inaccuracy, such as wrongly calling a lab technician a "technologist."

**teenage** (adj.); **a teenage boy** (_not teenaged boy_), **teenager(s)**, **teen(s)** See also [child, teen, young adult, etc.](/home/c/child_teen)

**teenybopper** (one word)

**teepee** (prefer this entrenched spelling over variants such as "tipi" and "tepee") It's a [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) of the original Sioux word, so there's no single, correct spelling. But "teepee" is best known to our general audience, partly because the double vowels ("ee") reflect the common English pronunciation. Teepee is also the first (primary) spelling listed in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

**teetotal, teetotaller**

**Teflon** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a non-stick coating)

**[Tel Aviv](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#telaviv)**

****telecommunication****

**Telefilm Canada** (A federal cultural agency funded by the federal government. It helps develop and promote Canadian film, television, music and new media productions. Telefilm Canada reports to the Department of Canadian Heritage.)

**Teleprompter** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for an autocue device) Capitalize only the first letter. Do not mirror the company's preference: "TelePrompTer" (See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

**television**, a television reporter (but **CBC Television, CBC-TV, CBC-TV News, CBC News**) See also [CBC](/home/c/cbc)

**ten-pin bowling, tenpins** (_not_ 10-pins) Also: five-pin bowling, fivepins (See [bowling](/home/b#bowling))

**tenterhooks** (_not_ tender-)

**terabyte, terabytes** (**TB** _not_ "Tbyte") TB is a metric symbol that's both singular and plural, along the lines of km, so it's **1 TB, 20 TB**, etc. Technically, there are 1,024 GB in 1 TB. But in general news stories, it's OK to consider 1 TB as roughly 1,000 GB. (See [metric](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial) for more guidelines on symbols that look like abbreviations)

**terminus, terminuses** (_not_ "termini") Even if you avoid the "-ni" plural, these are still very lofty nouns. The more conversational words "station" and "stations" are preferable.

[**terrorist** and **terrorism**](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism) (These words require great care. They should not be used to label people or events unless attributed. Please read the editorial guidelines carefully.)

[**the late**](/home/l#thelate) (as in now dead)

**the blind, the deaf, the disabled** (avoid this use of the definite article) See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language) for details

[**The** versus **the**](/home/t/the-versus-the) (**The Hague,** _but_ **the Netherlands; The National** _but_ **the Toronto Star**)

**The Hague** (not "Gravenhage," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**_The Lord of the Rings_** (In first reference, always include the definite article "The" before the full title.) The work was published, and later filmed, as a trilogy. The three books are, in order: _The Fellowship of the Ring_, _The Two Towers_, and _The Return of the King_. Books and films are always put in [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics). (See also [Middle-earth](/home/m#Middleearth))

**theatregoer** (one word)

**then** (for former or past) does not need a hyphen before a noun (e.g., **then president, then prime minister, then artistic director**, etc.) It's _not_ the same as ex-, which functions more as a prefix than as an attributive adjective. See also [ex-](/home/e#ex-) and [former](/home/f#former)

**therapeutic**

**The Rooms** (cultural complex in Newfoundland) Use a capital "T" to make the proper noun clearer and to reflect entrenched usage. This is a rare exception to our normal lowercase style for "the" before similar names. The Rooms includes a gallery, a museum, the provincial archives, etc. Unlike comparable proper nouns (e.g., the National Art Gallery, the Glenbow Museum), The Rooms is essentially a one-word name that takes on special meaning when paired with an uppercase definite article ("The"). See  [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the) for related guidelines.

**thesis, theses**

**they** (as singular pronoun) See **[they](/home/t/they_singular)** for tips on avoiding sexist or awkward (she/he) constructions, as well as **[transgender](/home/t/transgender)** (for handling requests to avoid gender-specific pronouns)

[**thin blue line**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/b/#blue-line-police "B") (avoid unless attributed)

****Three Wise Men*

*threshold*

*thrill-seeker, thrill-seeking*

*throne speech, speech from the throne*

*thumbs-down, thumbs-up****

**[thunderstorm](/home/w/weather-words#thunderstorm)**

**Tiananmen Square** (large plaza near the centre of Beijing); **Tiananmen Square massacre** (Numerous demonstrators were shot dead in the square in 1989 when Chinese authorities order the army to end a pro-democracy protest. The specific death toll is unknown. Estimates range from hundreds to thousands.)

**Tiber River, Italy** (not "Tevere," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Tibet** (not "Xizang," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames)) Tibet is an autonomous region of China. Its exiled spiritual leader is the Dalai Lama. China says Tibet has been a part of its territory for more than half a millennium, and that the Communist Party has governed the Himalayan region since Communist troops arrived there in 1951. Many Tibetans say they were effectively independent for most of their history, and complain that Chinese rule is eroding their traditional Buddhist culture.

**Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster Canada**; but **TicketsNow** (an online marketplace run by Ticketmaster, where people buy and sell already purchased tickets)

**tick-tack-toe** (game) Also known as **x's and o's** (lowercase, with [apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes))

****tidbit*

*tie, tying; tiebreaker****

**tie-down roping** (official name of calf roping at some rodeo competitions, including the Calgary Stampede) Prefer the more familiar name **calf roping** in routine news coverage. Include an explanation, such as "also known as tie-down roping," when it helps the audience (e.g., if someone uses tie-down roping in an on-air clip or web quote). In compound adjectival constructions, use only one hyphen (tie-down roping champion).

**tie up** (v.), tied up; **tie-up** (n.) as in "a **traffic tie-up**"

**till, until** (_not_ 'til)

**Timbuktu** (ancient city in Mali in West Africa) For consistency, prefer this entrenched spelling over alternatives, such as "Timbuctoo" in English or "Tombouctou" in French. The well-known name is sometimes used in figurative phrases about remote places (e.g., "from here to Timbuktu").

[**time**](/home/t/time) (use of ET, PT, etc.)

****time immemorial****

**timecard, timekeeper, timeline,** a train's **timetable** (one word); but **time capsule, time bomb, time code, time frame, time horizon, time limit, time off, time out, time saver, time span, times table** (in a math class), **time zone** (two words)

**Tontons Macoutes** (a private militia formed by the president of Haiti in the 1960s; disbanded in the 1980s) This secret police force was known for its brutal and arbitrary actions. While an individual member can be called a **Tonton Macoute**, generally prefer the plural form when referring to the militia as a whole (e.g., "She was taken by the Tontons Macoutes" and "It was a typical Tontons Macoutes tactic").

**toonie** ($2 coin), **toonies** (plural); **loonie** ($1 coin), **loonies** (plural)

**Top 10, Top 40**, etc. for recognized lists, such as music hits. (_The song reached No. 1 in the Top 10 in Canada_.) But lowercase "t" for generic contexts (e.g., _The top 40 chess players will compete for $10,000_.) See also [number versus No](/home/n#number).

**Torino 2006** (the event), held in [**Turin**](/home/t#Turin) (the city)

**tornado, tornadoes** (See [weather words](/home/w/weather-words))

**Toronto City Airport** (acceptable first reference to the [**Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport**](/home/b#BillyBishopAirport)) Other options include the **Toronto Island airport** (lowercase "a" because it's a descriptive name) and **Toronto's downtown island airport**. Do not use the old noun, the "Toronto City Centre Airport," which was officially changed in 2009. (See also [Airport versus airport](/home/a/airport))

**Toronto-Dominion Bank** (see [banks](/home/b/banks) for guidelines)

**Toronto Stock Exchange** (**TSX** fine in headlines and second reference) The TSX and TSX Venture Exchange are both run by TSX Inc., a subsidiary of **the TMX Group** (a new name adopted in 2008). The TMX Group owns several other subsidiaries, including the **Montreal Exchange** (**MX**), which we continue to call the [**Montreal Stock Exchange**](/home/m#MX), and the **Natural Gas Exchange**. The TMX Group's headquarters are in Toronto.

**Tory, Tories** (In second reference, an acceptable nickname for members of any provincial Conservative party as well as those who belong to the Conservative Party of Canada, created during a merger in the fall of 2003.) The terms _Tory_ and _Tories_ are OK in headlines, but should be used sparingly in the main body of a story and never in first reference. See also notes about the _Conservative Party of Canada_ under [Party versus party](/home/p/party)

****total, totalled****

**Touch-Tone** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for push-button dialling system)

But **Town** for corporate references (i.e., using a community's formal, legal name), as in "The Town of Biggar sued the company for $5 million." See also [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) for general guidelines on identifying communities in Canada.

**[transliterations](/home/t/transliterations)**

**Transnistria** (a Russian-controlled region along Moldova's northeast border with Ukraine) It can be accurately called an unrecognized breakaway territory, but always make it clear that most of the international community still considers the enclave part of Moldova. It's OK but unnecessary to point out that Transnistria is short for "Transdniestria," which means "beyond" or "across" the Dniester River. But avoid the more formal, hyphenated transliteration "Trans-Dniester," which is the equivalent of spelling "transatlantic" as "trans-Atlantic."

**Transport Canada**

**Transportation Safety Board**

**trauma, traumas, traumatic**

**travel, traveller, travelling**

**traveller's cheques** (not travellers') See [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) for relevant rule

**Trudeau, Justin** (became Canada's 23rd prime minister in the fall of 2015 at the age of 43) Son of Canada's 15th prime minister, [Pierre Elliott Trudeau](/home/t#PierreElliottTrudeau). Full name: Justin Pierre James Trudeau. Born Dec. 25, 1971. Married **Sophie Grégoire Trudeau**. in 2005. (No hyphen in her name. PMO confirmed this revised spelling as her preference in the spring of 2016.) Three children: **Xavier** (eldest son), **Ella-Grace** and **Hadrien** (youngest son).

**Trudeau, Pierre Elliott** (1919-2000) He was prime minister for about 15 years (from 1968-79, and from 1980-84). He married **Margaret** Sinclair in 1971. They separated in 1977 and divorced in 1984.

**Turin, Italy** (not "Torino," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames)) Turin is where the 2006 Winter Olympics were held. Refer to Turin as the city and **Torino 2006** as the event (e.g., _Torino 2006 athletes competed in Turin_). This style was adopted by CBC News and CBC Sports in 2004, as explained in a [Words: Woe & Wonder column](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fkiev-or-kyiv.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NAvZSqCruI4DyZUlkwCwM).

**turkey, turkeys** (_not_ turkies)

[**Turkey**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/turkey/ "Turkey") (country) _not_ "Türkiye"

**turtleneck sweater** (_no_ hyphen)

**Tutankhamen** (_not_ -amun) This famous Egyptian pharaoh, whose tomb was discovered in 1922, can be called **King Tut** in headlines and in second reference. A term such as the King Tut exhibit may be used in a lead as long as the full name is spelled out within a few paragraphs.

**Tutor** (training jet; plane used by the Snowbirds aerobatics team), _not_ Tudor

**Tutu, Desmond** (retired South African archbishop) The title "archbishop" is not held for life. Tutu is technically the Anglican Church's "archbishop emeritus" of Cape Town. But we normally use more conversational wording, such as "retired" or "former" (e.g., "_Retired archbishop Desmond Tutu says ..._"). As a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Desmond Tutu is so well known he can normally be referred to in first reference without the clerical title, especially in headlines or other places where space is limited.

**TV dinner** (small "d" because it's not longer a [trade name](/home/t/trade-names))

**TVOntario** (**TVO** is fine in headlines or second reference)

**tween, tweens** (An increasingly common term for kids who are not quite, or who have just become, teenagers) No universally defined age range. Conventionally refers to preadolescence — between roughly 10 and 13 — although the Canadian Oxford Dictionary defines **tweenager** as girls and boys between about eight and 14. (See [child, teen, young adult, etc.](/home/c/child_teen) for related guidelines)

**20th Century Fox** (_no hyphen_)

**20-something** (not "twentysomething"), **30-something**, etc.

**Twitter** (now known as **X**, which should be the default proper noun) A [social media](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/s/#socialmedia "S") network for sharing text, photos, videos, links, etc., in brief messages that are typically fewer than a few hundred characters. Founded in 2006, the company was purchased by Tesla CEO Elon Musk for $44 billion US in the fall of 2022, and then **rebranded as X** in July 2023. The parent company is **X Corp.** On first reference, continue to mention the old, familiar name once until the new proper noun becomes widely known (e.g., "**X, formerly known as Twitter**"). Go with X or the **X platform** in subsequent references. Historical citations can be approached the same way (e.g., "She made the announcement in 2011 on what was then known as Twitter"). Although **tweet** remains acceptable as a noun and verb, be aware that the term may evolve to variations of X, depending on popular usage. Musk, himself, has encouraged calling posts **X's** to reflect the revised branding. Another option is to use descriptive language about how comments, videos, links, etc., are shared (e.g., posted on X, published on the X platform, an X post).

**two**, marched in **twos**

**two-by-four** lumber, a two-by-four (_not_ 2x4, except in headlines) See [numbers](/home/n/numbers)

**two-spirit** (non-binary gender identification in various Indigenous cultures), as in a **two-spirit person**. For consistency, avoid the "-ed" form (i.e., prefer two-spirit and transgender over "two-spirited" and "transgendered"). See also [**2SLGBTQ+**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#2S "2SLGBTQ+").

**[typhoon](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon), Typhoon Ellen, Typhoon Dujuan** (Ellen, Dujuan in second reference; or "the typhoon" lowercase. See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) for general guidelines.) Do _not_ apply the pronouns "she," "her," "he" or "his" to storms. Use "it" and "its" instead.

### Taiwan

**Taiwan**

**Taiwan is an island** roughly 180 kilometres from mainland China. The waterway between the island and the continent is commonly called **the Taiwan Strait** in English. **Beijing insists that Taiwan is part of its country**. But **Taiwan's leaders reject Beijing's sovereignty claim**, which means that political control over the territory is disputed.

CBC News practice is to maintain impartiality. This means we **refer to Taiwan on its own in stories**, including in TV locators, but **avoid calling it a country or nation** outside of direct attribution. For instance:


> **Taiwan** (not "Taiwan, China")
> **Taipei, Taiwan**
> **Taiwan's election** is scheduled for ...
> The **island's economy** has ... (not "the country's" or "the nation's")
> She said **the self-governing island** is ...


There are **two main reasons** for this approach:


> **1\. It's impossible to satisfactorily convey the complexities of political or territorial disagreements in a few words** (i.e., in the limited real estate of a TV banner or locator).
>
> **2\. It's an acceptable convention to identify well-known geographical areas alone** (e.g., an island like **Sicily**, a peninsula like [**Crimea**](/home/c/crimea)), as in, "They met in Sicily" rather than "They met in Sicily, Italy."


NOTE: Although a linguistic distinction is often made between the terms [country and nation](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/n/nation-versus-country/ "Nation versus country"), such attempted nuance can easily cause confusion in coverage of territorial disputes. Therefore, avoid either word when referring to Taiwan for the reasons outlined above.

Use the entrenched spelling **Taipei**. Avoid competing [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), including, "Taibei."

In stories about political tensions over the region, it's a good practice to succinctly remind our audience about relevant positions of each side. In the case of **the Taiwan Strait**, for example, it's accurate to say that **China considers the passageway its own economic zone** while **the U.S. and its allies, including Canada, contend the waters are international**, regularly sailing through and flying over the strait to stress this stance.


**Additional background**
The **sovereignty dispute began in the late 1940s**, when Mao Zedong swept to power at the end of China's civil war. **Taiwan has its own government, holds its own elections and in many practical ways acts as an independent state. But Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province**, and is on the record saying that the region must be reunited with the mainland — either peacefully or by force.

**Beijing refuses to have official diplomatic relations with any country that openly recognizes Taiwan as a separate state.** This is commonly known as the "**One China policy**." As a result, Taiwan, is the world's most populated region (as well as the biggest economy) not to be a member of the United Nations. Nevertheless, many countries have informal relations with Taiwan through trade offices, cultural institutes, etc.

**Be aware that the official names of China and Taiwan are sometimes a source of confusion.** Mainland China is, technically, **the People's Republic of China (PRC)**. And Taiwan is, technically, **the Republic of China (ROC)**. The word "China" in Taiwan's own name is not an accident. For more than half a century, Taipei countered Beijing's claim to the island of Taiwan by asserting that Taiwan is the seat of China's true government. In recent decades, however, some of the island's politicians have tempered this stance, no longer insisting that the island of Taiwan has true sovereignty over mainland China. **In most news stories, this level of detail is not required.** It's also **rarely necessary to point out that Taiwan calls itself the "Republic of China."** Instead, prefer the proper noun Taiwan throughout.

### terrorist and terrorism

**Terrorist and terrorism**

**Overview**
**Exercise extreme caution before using the words terrorist and terrorism.** While the language is not seriously disputed in some cases, it's less clear if not highly contested at other times — which can lead to virtually endless questions about consistency and impartiality in our coverage of various attacks around the world. Put another way: **The words, themselves, can become impediments to reporting**. For this reason, generally **avoid labelling any specific bombing or other assault as a "terrorist act" unless this term is attributed** (in a TV or radio clip, or in a direct quote on the web).


> Examples: We should refer to the deadly suicide bombing at an airport in Moscow in January 2011 as an "attack," not as a "terrorist attack." The same applies to the London bombings in July 2005, the Madrid train bombings in March 2004 and the attacks against the United States in 2001, which CBC News prefers to call "**the Sept. 11 attacks**" or some similar expression. (The BBC, Reuters and some other news organizations follow a similar practice.)


Terrorism generally implies attacks against unarmed civilians for political, religious or some other ideological reason. But it's a highly controversial term that can leave journalists taking sides in a conflict.

**By restricting ourselves to neutral language, we aren't faced with the problem of calling one incident a "terrorist act"** (e.g., the destruction of the World Trade Center) **while classifying another as, say, a mere "bombing"** (e.g., the destruction of a crowded shopping mall in the Middle East).


**Use specific descriptions**
**The long-standing CBC News preference is straightforward: Generally don't judge specific acts as "terrorism" or people as "terrorists."** Instead, describe the act or individual and then let the viewers, listeners or readers make their own judgments.

**So rather than reaching for a label** ("terrorist" or "terrorism") when news breaks, **try summarizing what happened**. For example, "A suicide bomber blew up a bus full of unarmed civilians early Monday, killing at least two dozen people." The details of these tragedies give our audience the information they need to form their own conclusions about what type of attack it was.

**Instead of calling assailants "terrorists," we can refer to them as bombers, hijackers, gunmen** (if we're sure no women were in the group), **militants, extremists, attackers** or some other appropriate noun.

**When authorities declare a specific group a terrorist organization, it can be important to include this information to provide our audience with key context** (e.g., mentioning that [Hamas](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/middle-east-glossary/#hamas "Middle East glossary") has been classified as a terrorist group by Canada and more than a dozen other countries). **Attribution remains crucial, however**, especially since different governments around the world have been known to make highly contentious assertions about various organizations for political reasons (e.g., Myanmar's junta labelled Aung San Suu Kyi's exiled National Unity Government a terrorist organization, and Russia classified jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's regional campaign offices part of a terrorism network).

See also [fundamentalist, extremist, militant, etc.](/home/f/fundamentalist-extremist), for related guidelines.


**'Terror' and other derivations**
Related words such as "terror" also require care. As a generic noun (e.g., the bombing caused widespread terror), terror is OK as long as it's an accurate description of fear and chaos tied to a given story. But as an attributive noun (e.g., a terror group, a terror plot), it essentially means "terrorist" and, so, should be treated no differently.


> Example: In a TV banner, TERROR IN LONDON would be OK over images of a bombing aftermath, but TERROR ATTACK would be a poor choice because that text is the equivalent of TERRORIST ATTACK.


**No 'ban' in place**
There's a big difference between crafting guidelines on how to use controversial words in a certain way (e.g., cautiously and neutrally) and actually imposing a ban on those words.

**It's not practical to draft a list of all contexts in which the words _terrorist_ and _terrorism_ are appropriate in CBC News stories.** For instance, we might write that Canada and other countries have passed "anti-terrorism" legislation, or that intelligence agencies have lists of groups that they consider "terrorist" organizations, or that the U.S. government has issued another warning about an increased risk of "terrorist attacks" in the next few weeks, or that certain people have been charged with acts of "terrorism." **Use common sense**.

### that versus which

**That versus which**

Before picking one of these words, determine what you’re trying to say.


**That**

**If the detail in the sentence is essential, you need _that_.** This is known as a defining or restrictive clause. **Commas are not required:
**
_"The pianist plans to record the concerto that she wrote in Banff once she settles a contract dispute."_

This sentence implies that the musician composed only one concerto in Banff. She plans to record it.
_
"The truck that’s blue was searched by police."_

There may be a lot of trucks in the parking lot. This sentence tells us that the blue one was searched by police. It could be shortened to: _"The blue truck was searched by police."_


**Which**
**If the information is simply an aside, which can be separated by commas, choose which.** This is known as a non-defining or non-restrictive clause:

_"The pianist plans to record the concerto, which she wrote in Banff, once she settles a contract dispute."_

This sentence identifies the town where the concerto was written, but it says nothing about what else may have been composed there. It lifts the earlier restriction.

_"The truck, which is blue, was searched by police."
_
This sentence does not use colour to identify the vehicle inspected by police. The detail is tossed in as an aside. The clause could be removed without changing the overall meaning.

See also [CBC](/home/c/cbc) for general guidelines on program titles, including CBC News: _The National_ versus _The National_ in second reference.

**Also, use "The" for wire services and broadcast channels that include the article in their proper names:**


> The Associated Press
> The Canadian Press
> The Sports Network (TSN)


See [The Canadian Press, The Associated Press](/home/c/cpap) for more details, including guidelines on distinguishing between nouns ("told The Canadian Press") and adjectives ("the Associated Press reporter").


**Using 'the'**
**Most nicknames**

**A lowercase "the" is used for most nicknames and other informal labels**, except in very rare cases when the article gives a singular meaning to an ordinary word that might not otherwise be clear:


> the Last Supper
>
> the Red Planet
>
> the Oscars
>
> the Rockies
>
> The Show (baseball's major leagues)

**Most geographical names**
**Use a lowercase "the" in virtually all geographical references. Capitalize "the" only in those rare instances when it's part of the official name:
**

> The Hague, but the Netherlands
>
> The Pas
>
> [the Arctic](/home/a/arctic)
>
> [the Barrens](/home/b/barrens)
>
> the [Central African Republic](/home/c#CentralAfricanRepublic) (_the_ is common but optional)
>
> the Northwest Territories
>
> the Rocky Mountains
>
> the West Coast
>
> the West Indies
>
> [the Yukon](/home/y/yukon) (also known as Yukon)

**Be aware that in many cases, "the" is conventionally dropped** unless a full, formal name featuring a known like "kingdom" or "republic" is actually used in a given story:

>
>
> [Congo](/home/c/Congos) (_not the or The_)
>
> [Gambia](/home/g#Gambia) (_not the or The_)
>
> [Ivory Coast](/home/i#IvoryCoast) (_not the or The_)


**KEY TAKEAWAYS: "The" is sometimes, but rarely, required before geographical names** (e.g., A city called The Hague is in the Netherlands). **"The" is  sometimes always wrong** (e.g., [**Ukraine**](/home/u#Ukraine) but NEVER "the Ukraine" because the country has only one, official name), and **[Punjab](/home/p#Punjab)** but NEVER "the Punjab." **Frequently "the" is technically OK but simply not usually recommended** (e.g., Gambia rather than "The Gambia" or "the Republic of The Gambia") **because the shortened name is so entrenched.** (See also [country names](/home/g/geography-cities) for related guidelines)

**Miscellaneous**
**Keep "the" lowercase in almost all other contexts**, including at the start of almanacs, academic journals, directories, dictionaries, encyclopedias, handbooks, newspapers, holy books, most buildings, companies, ships, trains, music groups, awards, sports events, etc.

**Rare exceptions are generally based on entrenched usage tied to audience clarity** — e.g., when the capitalized article gives an otherwise single-word proper noun a distinct meaning:

> [The Rooms](/home/t#TheRooms) (a cultural facility in Newfoundland that includes a museum, art gallery and the provincial archives)

### they\_singular

**They** (singular)

**The pronoun "they" is normally plural. But it's become an acceptable convention to use it in some singular constructions**, either to eliminate sexist writing or to avoid gender-specific identification.

**Standard plural use**
The words they, them, their and themselves are traditionally plural.


> They held their breath.
> The car almost hit them.


**Acceptable 'singular they'**
**When gender is irrelevant, it's become increasingly common to use "they" as a singular pronoun rather than to clutter our speech with sexist choices** (e.g., always using "he") **or with clumsy, wordy constructions** (e.g., she/he, hers/his). For instance:


> If **your child** is under 18, **he** may qualify for the grant. **(POOR** — SEXIST)
> If **your child** is under 18, **she/he** may qualify for the grant. (**POOR** — AWKWARD)
> If **your child** is under 18, **they** may qualify for the grant. (**OK — SINGULAR 'THEY'**)


**Rewriting options**
**While using "they" as a singular pronoun can be fine, recasting is sometimes preferable.** The most common rewrites involve turning singular subjects into plurals, using the articles "a" or "the" in place of plural constructions, and simply dropping superfluous pronouns.


> If your children are under 18, **they** may qualify for the grant.
> Children under 18 may qualify for the grant.



> **The customer** should be told ahead of time they have to pay extra for shipping.
> **Customers** should be told ahead of time they have to pay extra for shipping.



> Each student was given six months to declare **their** major.
> Each student was given six months to declare **a** major.



> A tenant slipped on a wet floor and hit **their** head, suffering a minor concussion.
> A tenant slipped on a wet floor and suffered a minor concussion.


I**n many cases, however, such rewrites are not possible** — especially when a generic, unknown individual is the subject of the sentence. For instance:


> **Someone** left **their** iPhone in the washroom.


In this case the phone, itself, could be made the subject of the sentence. But that sort of rewrite may be deemed less satisfactory for various reasons, including a shift to the passive voice:


> An iPhone was left in the washroom.


**Writers and editors must make their own judgments** about effective word choice. **As they do, however, they should ignore unfounded claims that "they" must be treated exclusively as a plural pronoun.** Its use as a singular pronoun in certain cases is now an entrenched aspect of modern English.

**Themself, themselves**
Although the standard reflexive form of "them" is plural ("themselves"), the alternative **"themself" is recommended when "them" is tied to a singular subject.** For historical perspective: "Themself" was actually common from the 14th to 16th centuries before virtually disappearing. The pronoun started making a comeback **as part of a wider trend toward gender-neutral writing and speech in the 1980s** (e.g., **"How could anyone defend themself?"** rather than "How could anyone defend himself?").

Some traditionalists object to this trend, classifying "themself" as obsolete and insisting on the plural reflexive in singular cases (e.g., "How could anyone defend themselves?"). But **it's a myth that "themself" is inherently ungrammatical.** As the 2015 edition of Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage puts it: "The final battle for a set of gender-free pronouns will probably be fought over 'themself,' but it's hard to see what could comfortably replace it."

In 2004, linguist Pam Peters expressed support for "themself" even more forcefully:

_"If we allow the use of 'they/them/their' for **referring to the singular, 'themself' seems more consistent than 'themselves.'** We make use of 'yourself' alongside 'yourselves' in the same way. 'Themself' has the additional advantage of being gender-free, and thus \[is\] preferable to both 'himself' and 'himself/herself.' **It's time to reinstate it** to the set of reflexive pronouns."_

— Cambridge Guide to English Usage

**In most news stories, of course, an emphatic reflexive can usually be dropped** without loss of meaning or significant reduction in narrative force (e.g., "The protesters, themselves, say they don't care" can be trimmed to, "The protesters say they don't care"). **But in other constructions, reflexive pronouns may be needed** unless entire sentences are recast. **In such cases, generally prefer "themself" when the subject is singular and "themselves" when the subject is plural** (e.g., "Everyone was asked to look after themself" versus "They were all asked to look after themselves").

**Transgender**
**In recent years, "they" has been used as a non-binary, singular pronoun by many transgender people** who do not identify as either a man or as a woman:

"They were asked to look after themself at a young age."
"They said being able to poke fun at themself was a crucial first step in their stand-up comedy career."

**Such usage in fine in our journalism, as long as we guard against possible audience confusion.** See **[transgender](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/transgender/#pronouns "Transgender")** for details.

### Time

**Time**[](/home/t/time#local)

[Two-letter time zone shorthand](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Shorthand "Time") (e.g., ET not EDT)


[Prefer figures](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Prefer "Time") (but noon, midnight are fine)
[Abbreviating clock readings](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Abbreviating "Time") (2:01 p.m., 40.7 seconds)

[Dating stories](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#dating "Time") (and other caveats)

**Specify local time**

Since stories written by CBC journalists in different parts of the country may be read, watched or heard by people outside of a specific province or territory, **one of Canada's seven time zones should be specified** when clock readings are included in editorial content. **On air, this is often done by using the word "local" or naming a city or province** (e.g., 2 p.m. Vancouver time). Online, time zone abbreviations are generally preferred because they're shorter and easier to scan (e.g., 2 p.m. PT).

Each zone has a two-letter abbreviation, but only four use uppercase lettering when spelled out:
Newfoundland time (NT)
Atlantic time (AT)
eastern time (ET)
central time (CT)
mountain time (MT)
Pacific time (PT)
Yukon time (YT) \*

**Use local times for all domestic stories**. For instance, specify 4:30 p.m. AT when referring to something happening in the Atlantic time zone (not 3:30 p.m. ET), and 11 a.m. MT when referring to the mountain time zone (not 1 p.m. ET).

**For international coverage, it's sometimes helpful but rarely necessary to include a Canadian time zone in parentheses**. In certain cases, a straight conversion is also OK. (In a story from Berlin, for instance: "Olaf Scholz called Trudeau at 4 a.m. Ottawa time to tell him about the tragedy.") Otherwise, local times are implied and sufficient.

**Almost always use the two-letter time zone abbreviations** (uppercase, with no periods) **after specific clock readings year-round**:

5:28 p.m. NT, 7:13 a.m. AT, 10:35 p.m. ET, 8:19 a.m. CT, 11:12 p.m. PT.

**The only anomalies are most of Saskatchewan**, which is on central standard time all year, **and parts of northeastern British Columbia**, which operate on mountain standard time all year.

12:45 a.m. CST
3:15 p.m. MST

See [Saskatchewan](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Saskatchewan "Time") and [Northeastern B.C.](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Northeastern "Time") below for more details.

**ET not EST, PT not PDT, etc.**

**With the exception of Saskatchewan and northeastern British Columbia, avoid specifying "standard" (S) or "daylight" (D) time**.

For instance, simply write 2:15 a.m. ET instead of 2:15 a.m. EST or 2:15 a.m. EDT.

This format eliminates the need to worry about which extra letter to add and avoids confusion over whether the S represents "standard" or "saving." It also matches commonly used date/time stamps that are automatically generated by CBC's web publishing tool when stories are first posted or updated, such as:

Last Updated: Monday, June 26, 2006 | 1:46 p.m. MT.

Canadians who really want the extra detail (S or D) can determine the correct information themselves, based on the date.

**If the time zone difference between Canada and another country is unusual** (e.g. 7.5 hours) **it's a good idea to include an explanation** to help readers who might be puzzled by the conversion.

**Time zones are generally determined by provinces or territories, though they are also sometimes decided upon by municipalities.** That means **they do not always neatly follow provincial borders and there are important regional exceptions**. 

Most of British Columbia is on PT, but an area in the southeastern part of the province is on MT and a region in northeastern B.C. is on MST (see [Northeastern British Columbia](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Northeastern "Time") below for details).

Yukon time was established in March of 2020. The territory aligns with MST during the fall and winter and PDT during the spring and summer. The simplest label, however, is "Yukon time" (YT). Although one could argue Yukon is simply on mountain standard time all year, the spirit of the change embraces a permanent West Coast daylight time. And while one could also say Yukon is on Pacific daylight time all year, that label becomes potentially confusing when "PT" (Pacific time) is used for stories about British Columbia.

Use CST for Saskatchewan. Most of the province, except for an area near and including Lloydminster, is officially on central standard time all year (see [Saskatchewan](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Saskatchewan "Time") below for details).

The western part of Ontario is on CT, unlike most of the province, which is on ET.

Nunavut is spread over three time zones: MT, CT and ET.

Most of Labrador is on AT. So do not refer to NT as "Newfoundland and Labrador time."

**Saskatchewan**

To ensure accuracy and clarity, **use CST in all Saskatchewan clock readings**.

Although a few of its border communities change their clocks to match shifts in daylight time in neighbouring provinces, **Saskatchewan as a whole can be accurately described as being on CST 12 months of the year**. Even though CST = MDT between mid-March and early November, never imply that Saskatchewan actually shifts to mountain time. It does not.

Keep in mind that it can be a mental chore for people to convert a story's time into something more meaningful to them, even if they have the basics memorized (e.g., even if they know that Regina on CST and Calgary on MT share the same time from early spring to late fall, that Regina on CST and Winnipeg on CT share the same time from late fall to early spring, or that there's always a three-hour difference between PT and ET). So **when reporting key details that hinge on time elements, consider offering context for a broader audience** (e.g., "He promised to announce the decision at 4 p.m. Regina time, but then said he forgot that this meant 5 p.m. in Winnipeg because Manitoba is on daylight time").

See also: [Limit use of daylight and standard time](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Limit "Time") below.

**Northeastern British Columbia**

Somewhat similar to Saskatchewan, **there is an area in northeastern B.C.** – including Fort Nelson, Fort St. John, Dawson Creek and other communities – **that follows mountain standard time all year and does not observe daylight time**.

Functionally, that means that the area is in line with Pacific time for part of the year. However, because the people in these areas have specifically selected to follow mountain standard time, it would not be accurate to say that they follow Pacific time.

It is important to avoid confusion with other areas of B.C. and nearby communities in Alberta that follow mountain daylight time.

So, **when referencing times in the area of northeastern B.C. that operates on mountain standard time the entire year, use MST as an abbreviation**.

See also: [Limit use of daylight and standard time](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/time/#Limit "Time") below.

In Canada, **most provinces move their clocks ahead one hour on the second Sunday in March (they "spring" ahead to daylight time)**. 

The "D" in time clock readings refers to "daylight" time (EDT, PDT). It's usually unnecessary except in stories focused on semi-annual time changes. **Steer clear of the longer term "DS" for "daylight saving" time** (e.g., do NOT use EDST, PDST), for reasons outlined above. And **if you DO spell out "DS," keep the "S" singular for consistency** (i.e., "daylight saving" NOT "savings").

BROADCAST VS. WEB: To reiterate, **it's rarely necessary to specify daylight or standard time in stories**, except when writing about something directly tied to the seasonal adjustment of clocks. In these cases, use the term "daylight time" (not daylight _"saving"_ time) in web articles.

_She missed her plane by an hour because her watch was still set to daylight time._

This in-house CBCNews.ca preference matches Canadian Press guidelines. Therefore, **while it's conversational and acceptable to say "daylight saving" in broadcast journalism, it's not the corporation's default web style** — based on established publishing conventions.

**When spelled out, the words "daylight" and "standard" are lowercase**:

Newfoundland standard time, Atlantic standard time, Pacific standard time, eastern standard time, central standard time, mountain standard time

Newfoundland daylight time, Atlantic daylight time, Pacific daylight time, eastern daylight time, central daylight time, mountain daylight time

**Changes introduced in 2007**

Daylight time used to begin later and end sooner (on the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, respectively). A new system was adopted by the U.S. and most of Canada in March 2007.

**Prefer figures**
Generally use figures for times (11:30 a.m.), but write noon and midnight (lowercase), _not_ 12 noon or 12 midnight:

_The plane crashed around noon PT._

**Abbreviating clock readings** (2 a.m., 2:01 p.m., a winning time of 2:38:40.7)

**The terms a.m. and p.m. are always lowercase with periods**.

**Use colons to separate hours and minutes** (2:01 p.m. NT). **But leave out colons in all top-of-the-clock readings** (2 p.m. NT, not 2:00 NT).

**In digital publishing, generally repeat a.m. and p.m. in time ranges** for clarity (e.g., 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.).

**In broadcast scripts, it's an acceptable convention to drop abbreviations** that are implied and clear from context in order to keep our writing conversational (e.g., 8 to 11 a.m., and 1 to 2 p.m.). The most common exception are time ranges that straddle noon or midnight (e.g., 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. to 3 a.m.). **In certain video and radio coverage, it's OK to report hour readings only** (e.g., "9 to 4" and "11 to 3"), **as long as the time of day is obvious from context**.

**When reporting duration**, such as the winning time of a sports race, **use colons to separate hours, minutes and seconds, and periods to indicate tenths of a second** (2:38:40.7). **When spelling out such abbreviations, avoid adding conjunctions** (e.g., His time was two hours 38 minutes 40.7 seconds). See [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games) for more detailed guidelines.

**Outside of clock readings, units of time are almost always spelled out** (e.g., 15 minutes rather than 15 "min."). **But in graphics, TV text, etc., it's OK to abbreviate words if space is severely limited**. In those cases, **include periods and leave singular even in plural constructions** (e.g., hr. for hour and hours, min. for minute and minutes, and sec. for second and seconds). See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations#measurements) for related guidelines.

**GMT**
When converting clock readings from overseas, keep in mind that **Greenwich mean time (GMT) is five hours ahead of eastern standard time** (during Canada's fall and winter), **and four hours ahead of eastern daylight time** (during Canada's spring and summer).

**Although Greenwich mean time (GMT) stays the same all year, Britain adjusts its clocks in the spring and fall.** It moves to "summer time" (the equivalent of our "daylight time") in April, and then switches back in October. **So for six months, London is actually one hour ahead of GMT.**


**Dating stories with inappropriate time references**
As today becomes yesterday tomorrow, it's almost impossible for editors and writers to find and change every dated reference that may be hiding in someone else's copy. So **be careful when using terms like "this morning" or "today" or "last night"** in our online journalism.

There's value in the immediacy of certain phrasing (e.g., "The plane will try an emergency landing in the next few minutes" and "The premier is expected to announce his resignation at 1 p.m. ET"), including how we word various headlines (e.g., "Court decides Senator's fate today").

**Web writers are obligated to ensure that evolving stories remain current, and this sometimes involves dealing with time references that can become dated.** So before the end of your shift, make sure either (i) dated wording is changed or (ii) that plans are made to have dated wording changed (e.g., _"This afternoon's court ruling"_ would become **_"Thursday's court ruling"_**).

Also **avoid redundancies** (e.g., write "4:15 p.m. Thursday," _not_ "4:15 p.m. _Thursday afternoon._") And **avoid contradictory terms like "at about."** Pick one. It either happened at 4:15 p.m. or it happened about (or _around_) 4:15 p.m., but not _at about_.


**1950s, 2010s, Dirty '30s, March 15, Aug. 12**
**Add apostrophes to plural forms of INDIVIDUAL letters , whether lowercase or capitalized,** to help distinguish the "s" from the rest of the group (p's and q's, X's and O's). This applies to SINGLE letters of the alphabet only.  **But do NOT add apostrophes to form the plurals of clusters of capital letters or numbers** (ABCs, FAQs, MPs, SOBs, 747s). See also [apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes)

**Prefer figures to label decades**: the 1930s, the '30s (instead of the Thirties), the Dirty '30s. Exceptions are certain entrenched names treated as proper nouns (e.g., the '60s but the [Sixties Scoop](/home/s#Sixties_Scoop)).

**Do not put apostrophes before the "s" in the plural forms of years** (1980s, 1920s, mid-1940s). Also, generally treat a decade as a descriptive adjective rather than a true possessive (a 1950s radio).

**Use a hyphen with "mid"** (mid-1950s, mid-1990s) **but not with "early" or "late"** (early 1970s, late 1990s).

**Abbreviate years with apostrophes when seeking an informal tone** (the '70s), **but not when referring to an official name that doesn't include the punctuation** (Expo 67, Expo 86). See also [World Fair versus world fair](/home/w/world-fair)

**The first two decades of the new millennium merit special mention.** They initially caused confusion for many because previous, entrenched naming patterns did not apply. After a thousand years of using the word hundred (e.g., 1700s, 1800s), a shift was required. No one says "twenty hundred" (for 2000) the way they say "nineteen hundred" (for 1900). Instead, we refer to the year 2000 as "two thousand." Therefore, **the current century's first decade is commonly called the 2000s** (pronounced the "two-thousands"), **and its second decade is commonly called the 2010s** (usually pronounced either the "twenty tens" or the "two-thousand tens"). This matches traditional naming conventions used by historians. For example, the 1610s (pronounced "sixteen tens") and the 1910s ("pronounced "nineteen tens").


> 2000s
>
> the '00s   \*\*
>
> 2010s
>
> the '10s   \*\*
>
> mid-2010s
>
> 2020s


\*\* As long as the specific decade meant is obvious

**Be aware that the name given to a century's first decade** (e.g., 1800s) **could also used to mean the entire century.** For instance, "the mid-1800s" can narrowly mean around 1805 (in the same way that the mid-1880s suggests around 1885). But "the mid-1800s" can also strongly suggest the middle of the 19th century (i.e., the 1850s). **To avoid ambiguity, consider different wording** (e.g., a specific year or a range of years) **if a story's context doesn't make the time reference clear.**

**Colloquial names are sometimes given to decades** (e.g., the 1920s were dubbed the Roaring '20s). Depending on a story's tone, **such nicknames can be OK as long as they're reasonably well known or the specific years being referred to are clear.**

**Technically, decades, centuries and millennia all start at the "01" mark because there was no "year zero"** (i.e., because "1 [BC](/home/b#BC)" was followed by "[AD](/home/a#AD) 1"). **However, it's a common convention to use more tidy, intuitive ranges** (e.g., **the 1970s** traditionally means **1970-79** rather than 1971-80). For this reason, 2000 is widely and acceptably considered the start of the 21st century as well as the beginning of the third millennium).

**Centuries can be clipped in second reference**, using the following guidelines:


> 1965-81
>
> 1997-98
>
> 1892-1903
>
> 1999-2002

[Honorary and hereditary titles](/home/t/titles#honorary) (Sir, Lord, etc.)
[Speaker](/home/t/titles#Speaker) (never speaker)

**This page primarily focuses on typography**, including how to handle titles before names versus titles on their own, and when to distinguish between formal titles (capitalized) and mere job descriptions (lowercase). **For editorial direction not listed above, see specific entrie**s elsewhere in the Language Guide (e.g., [Royal titles](/home/r/royal-titles) such as king, princess and duke, [Titles during elections](/home/e/election-titles) and the honorific [Dr.](/home/d/dr) for people with medical degrees).

**TV TEXT REMINDER:** Be aware that television graphics, banners, supers, etc., have some unique typographical conventions. The biggest difference is the use of more initial capital letters in titles, job descriptions, etc. (e.g., "Former Prime Minister" instead of former prime minister, and "High School Principal" instead of high school principal). See the [**TV Text overview**](/home/t/tv_text) for details.

**Overview**
**Capitalize all references to Canada's reigning monarch and the country's current Governor General, as well as to the current Pope:**

> the Pope's letter, the King's visit, the Governor General's speech


**Otherwise, generally use capital letters for other _currently_ held titles only when they appear _immediately before a name_.** A few of these words are abbreviated (e.g., Coun. for councillor and Prof. for professor). Some of the more common titles are:

 **TITLE**

 TITLE **before** name

**Although cabinet ministers' titles are capitalized before names, secondary** (often informal) **government positions are not:** Finance Minister Red Buttons but _junior finance minister Red Buttons;_ Trade Minister Red Buttons but _deputy trade minister Red Buttons;_ etc.

**When titles are particularly long** (especially **in the case of junior cabinet ministers), it's often helpful to recast the sentence to make the details easier for web readers to scan**. For instance, while all of the following are acceptable, the first version is somewhat unwieldy:

> _Minister of State for the Status of Women Helena Guergis_
>
> He talked to _junior cabinet minister Helena Guergis_
>
> _Helena Guergis, the minister of state for the status of women_
>
> _Minister of State for Sport Gary Lunn_
>
> _federal Sports Minister Gary Lunn_


**The expression shadow cabinet is common and OK**, especially in coverage of Canadian, British and other parliamentary systems. It refers to members of an opposition party designated as counterparts to government cabinet ministers. By contrast, **the narrower term shadow minister requires care.** Although shadow cabinets are by definition made up of shadow ministers, not all Canadians are familiar with the latter label. Some opposition parties in Canada have begun using the expression "shadow minister" a lot in recent years at the provincial, territorial and federal level, which may increase comprehension. As long as the meaning is obvious from context, a term such as "shadow finance minister" is fine in political coverage. But **be mindful of potential audience confusion and lean toward alternative wording** (e.g., a given party's "finance critic") **when there's risk of ambiguity.**


**Prefer the word councillor when referring to municipal politicians**. Use alderman and alderwoman only if this is the official title adopted by a municipality. Before names, it's: _Ald. Fred Russell, Ald. Betty Ali._ In plural: _alderwomen Betty Ali and Janice Heinz_.

**In Canada, "premier" is now conventionally assigned to the leader of the governing party in provinces as well as territories.** The word is uppercase only when directly before the name of the current premier: _Nunavut Premier Paul Okalik_ versus _Paul Okalik, the premier of Nunavut; Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty_ versus _Dalton McGuinty, the premier of Ontario_. **Avoid the expression "premiers and territorial leaders,"** which is redundant. By contrast, **"provincial and territorial leaders" is fine.**

**Include geographical modifiers in the titles of foreign leaders in first reference**, regardless of the person's profile (e.g., _U.S. President Donald Trump_). See **[United States](/home/u/united-states)** for related guidelines. **Avoid the American convention of leaving out "past" or "former" for previous office holders** (e.g., our style is _former U.S. president Bill Clinton_). See [former, retired, acting, interim](/home/t/titles#former) below for details and related guidelines.


**Titles versus occupations and temporary appointments**
**Distinguish between formal titles and mere job descriptions** (e.g., a company's president versus the person in the White House). **A few positions are conventionally treated as titles before names** (e.g., a judge versus a school principal). **Abbreviations often mask what would otherwise be lowercase lettering** (e.g., MP versus "member of Parliament," Prof. versus "professor," and Dr. versus "doctor").

**If an office is unique, capital letters are generally used** when the title appears before the name (e.g., Privy Council Clerk Joseph Olivier Côté versus Appeal Court clerk Joe Coats). **This includes top medical health officers across the country** — a style we enshrined during coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. **If a position is unique but relatively junior, however, the title is usually kept all lowercase** (e.g., parliamentary librarian Bill Young). **Temporary appointments are also lowercase across the board** (e.g., special prosecutor, special envoy, special mediator, special prosecutor, special rapporteur), even before the person's name.

> ABC president Red Buttons
>
> Air Canada president Red Buttons
>
> Alberta Chief Medical Officer of Health Red Buttons
>
> Appeal Court clerk Red Buttons
>
> Appeal Court Judge Red Buttons
>
> astronaut Red Buttons
>
> Auditor General Red Buttons
>
> chief of staff Red Buttons
>
> Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Red Buttons
>
> federal Privacy Commissioner Red Buttons
>
> general manager Red Buttons
>
> historian Red Buttons
>
> Judge Red Buttons
>
> Parliamentary Budget Officer Red Buttons
>
> parliamentary librarian Red Buttons
>

>
> school principal Red Buttons
>
> special prosecutor Red Buttons
>
> special rapporteur Red Buttons
>
> taxi driver Red Buttons
>
> Treasury Board President Red Buttons
>
> trustee Red Buttons


**Deputy versus deputy**
**The word Deputy is capitalized only if it's part of an official designation.** If the position is informal (such as deputy premier), keep the term deputy lowercase:

> Deputy Chief Medical Health Officer Red Buttons (_when an official title_ in a given jurisdiction)
>
> Deputy Chief Red Buttons (never Deputy _police_ Chief since rank is _Deputy Chief_ )
>
> Deputy Mayor Red Buttons (_an official title_)
>
> deputy premier Red Buttons (_not an official title_)
>
> Deputy Prime Minister Red Buttons (_an official title_)
>
> deputy trade minister Red Buttons (_not an official title_)
>
> NDP deputy leader Red Buttons (_not an official title_)



**Apposition latitude**
In the boggy terrain of bona fide versus false titles, the word "apposition" sometimes surfaces. It's a fancy way of describing certain noun sequences — usually one or more nouns placed in front of another to provide additional information. For instance, "high school math teacher" Nirmila Rajput is an appositive description of someone's job rather than a genuine title. These types of **appositives are common in journalism** because they help convey key detail succinctly.

**Some editors argue that virtually all appositives should be kept lowercase** because they're not true titles. Others, however, regard this approach as overly simplistic because it can lead to wildly jarring renderings. For instance, the respected but sometimes idiosyncratic Chicago Manual of Style recommends that when "German" is added to "Chancellor Angela Merkel" the revised block of nouns should be written as "German chancellor Angela Merkel" with a lowercase "c" because the geographical modifier technically turns her official title into a descriptive appositive. The core of the argument is that the formal title ("Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany") can be shortened to "Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel" or to "Chancellor Angela Merkel," but that the noun "Germany" cannot actually be changed to "German" and shifted forward without eroding the true title. **It's a contestable view that does not reflect CBC News style:
**

>
>
> Chancellor Angela Merkel (_fine_)
>
> German Chancellor Angela Merkel (_fine_)
>
> German chancellor Angela Merkel _(not CBC style_)


**Certain possessive constructions are debated in a similar way**. It boils down to whether a formal, universally accepted construction such as "Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany" can be colloquially recast as "Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel" (OK) or if it must automatically become either "Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel" (NOT CBC style), or "Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel," with the person's name set off by commas to mark a non-restrictive appositive.

To be clear: **There's no need to prefer possessive forms when equally common and conversational alternatives exist.** Why write "Manitoba's Premier Jane Smith" when "Manitoba Premier Jane Smith" generally does the job? **At the same time, there's no need to insist on imposing lowercase titles just because a key geographical detail is reported in the possessive form before a proper noun.** The only exceptions are rare cases of intentionally written, non-restrictive appositives that use commas to mark a person's name as secondary, optional detail:


> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
>
> Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (_acceptable shorthand for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan_)
>
> Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe (_not CBC style_)
>
> Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, (_rare; limited to cases when name is considered parenthetical_)
>
> French President Emmanuel Macron
>
> France's President Emmanuel Macron (_acceptable shorthand for President Emmanuel Macron of France_)
>
> France's president Emmanuel Macron (not _CBC style_)
>
> France's president, Emmanuel Macron, (_rare; limited to cases when name is considered parenthetical_)


**We apply the above template to other appositives treated as genuine titles before names** in order to avoid introducing debatable and befuddling capitalization complexity into our journalism:


> Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam
>
> Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam
>
> Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam (not CBC style)


Some veteran editors are quick to point out that **possessives like this are rarely necessary**. It's a sound observation. **But in certain cases, such constructions have become relatively entrenched** in everyday speech:


> Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson
>
> Canada's Auditor General Sheila Fraser
>
> Toronto's Medical Officer of Health Eileen de Villa


**These possessive forms are instantly perceived as titles, or proper title equivalents**, which means there's no risk of confusion. And given the relatively arbitrary nature of syntactic capitalization preferences, **there's no need to make our audience ride a roller-coaster of uppercase and lowercase characters** before finally arriving at a given individual's name.


**Former, retired, acting, interim, outgoing, etc.**
Even when titles appear directly before names, **do not use capital letters if people haven't been sworn in yet** (U.S. president-elect), **if they're just temporarily filling in** ("acting prime minister" versus the proper title "Deputy Prime Minister" or someone appointed on a longer, [interim](/home/a/acting-versus-interim) basis), **if their designations are informal** ("deputy premier" or "party whip"), and **in most cases when the positions are no longer held** (former prime minister Joe Clark, former premier Ralph Klein) unless they continue to carry out duties (e.g., retired cardinals under 80 can still be called on to help pick a new Pope, so it's retired Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte). **Continue to use uppercase for departing political leaders until an interim replacement is announced** (e.g., outgoing Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion). **Avoid the American convention of leaving out "past" or "former" for previous office holders** (e.g., our style is former U.S. president Barack Obama). Note: In certain historical references, it's sometimes best to drop terms such as "former" or "ex," as outlined in [past versus present](/home/t/titles#droppingformer).

**Capitalize the first letter of words that begin sentences, headlines, etc.** _So retired general_  John de Chastelain would become Retired general John de Chastelain if this is the first word.


**Past versus present** (dropping former)
**When referring to past events, don't use terms such as former**, ex-, the late, then, etc. Instead, use the year and then **keep the title in uppercase:**

    On Jan. 26, 1976, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became the first Canadian leader to pay an official visit to Cuba.

Although ex- is a good choice for headlines (e.g., ex-PM), be careful when using the term before compound nouns (e.g., ex-prime minister) and adjectives (e.g., ex-Liberal MP). See also [ex-](/home/e#ex-) and [the late](/home/l#thelate)


**Honorary and hereditary titles**
**Canada's reigning monarch can usually be called the King or** (depending on the story's context) **the King of Canada.** Adding a name is optional (King Charles or King Charles III). **For other members of the Royal Family, use titles before first names** (Prince William, Princess Beatrice). **Titles are kept in uppercase for past Canadian** (and British) **monarchs** (e.g., Queen Victoria, King George VI). Use uppercase King and Queen for _reigning_ foreign monarchs only if the title appears directly before the name. (See [**royal titles**](/home/r/royal-titles) for detailed guidelines)
**
Do not confuse knighthoods with the nobility. The titles are chivalry honours and should generally be avoided in stories except in directly transcribed quotes** (e.g., Elton John _not_ Sir Elton John, Alfred Hitchcock _not_ Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Elizabeth Taylor not Dame Elizabeth). **An exception is made for historical figures whose titles have become entrenched over time:** Sir John A. Macdonald. This approach has nothing to do with minimizing the merit of a particular honour. Rather, it's to be consistent in limiting our use of titles (e.g., we don't call people with honorary PhDs "[Dr.](/home/d/dr)"). It's worth noting that many high-profile people have actually turned down chivalry honours from Buckingham Palace, which helps put into perspective any celebrity's insistence on being called Sir or Dame during interviews.

**Life peerages should be used only if relevant to the story.** In these cases, type in the full title: Lord Black of Crossharbour (Lord Black in second reference). Otherwise, stick to the name that's more familiar (Conrad Black).


**Speaker**
**The word Speaker is always uppercase when referring to Parliament and provincial legislatures** to avoid confusion with the generic meaning "one who speaks." (So it's Speaker Red Buttons and deputy Speaker Red Buttons.) **A capital letter is also used even when the person no longer holds the office** (former Speaker Gilbert Parent). See [Speaker](/home/s/speaker)


**Leader**
**The word leader is always lowercase unless it's immediately after the name of a political party and directly before a name.** (Conservative _Leader_ Red Buttons, but party _leader_ Red Buttons.) See [Leader versus leader](/home/l/leader)

### ton versus tonne

**Ton versus tonne**

Try to **use tonne rather than ton** when including specific measurements of weight in stories. You must do more than simply add a consonant and a vowel to the word ton. You have to perform **a straightforward calculation**.


**From tons to tonnes**
A "**ton**" is also known as a "short ton," although we don’t use that term. It’s **2,000 pounds (or 907.19 kilograms)**. When given a weight in tons, multiply this number by 0.907 to get tonnes (also known as "metric tons").

5.5 tons = 5.5 x .907 = 4.99 tonnes, which can be rounded to "nearly five tonnes"


**From tonnes to tons**
A "**metric ton**" (a tonne) is **1,000 kilograms (or 2,204.62 pounds)**. To go from metric tons (tonnes) to tons, multiply by 1.1

5 tonnes = 5 x 1.1 = 5.5 tons


**From long tons to tonnes**
**Unless specified, a "ton" in North America normally refers to a "short ton."** A slightly heavier amount, known as a "long ton," is common in Britain. **A "long ton" is 2,240 pounds (or 1,016.05 kilograms)**. It’s virtually the same as a metric tonne (about 35 pounds heavier). To go from a "long ton" to a metric tonne, multiply by 1.016

5.5 long tons = 5.5 x 1.016 = 5.588 tonnes, which can be rounded to "about 5.6 tonnes" or "just over 5.5 tonnes," etc.

**Since there’s a difference of only about 35 pounds between a long ton and a metric ton, the conversion isn’t significant in stories dealing with relatively small numbers.** For every 63 long tons, there is roughly one extra tonne (63 x 35 = 2,205 pounds).


**A ton of information**
Although we prefer metric measurements for most weights, **use "ton"** not tonne **in colloquial expressions** (e.g., "_a ton of bricks_" and "_weighed a ton_"). This includes various industry conventions, such as the hauling capacity of some vehicles (e.g., a _half-ton truck_, a _four-ton truck_).

### top\_doctor

**Top doctor**

A conversational and **acceptable synonym for the senior public health officer in a given country, province or community.** The idiomatic term **conventionally means that the physician is considered a specific government's authoritative voice for recommended public health measures**. The person's advice is almost always based on extensive consultation with others. "Top doctor" does not mean that the office holder has managerial powers over other doctors or is objectively the "best" physician.

**Use in moderation** to avoid becoming tiresome, especially during extensive coverage of a pandemic or other crisis when the colloquialism can quickly become clichéd.

**Always include the physician's formal title in stories to make the meaning of "top doctor" clear** (e.g., Canada's chief public health officer, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Toronto's medical officer of health). Use initial caps [when the titles appear before names](/home/t/titles#apposition) (Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam). Be aware that some jurisdictions refer to their senior health officials without modifiers like "chief" (e.g., B.C.'s provincial health officer).

The informal label **"top doctor" implies that the person has a medical degree** rather than merely a PhD in science, so make sure the facts fit before using (i.e., that the "top doctor" is an MD).

**Avoid wording that implies there's a hierarchy when reporting on more than one senior public health official** in Canada. We get audience complaints if we wrongly suggest that regional "top doctors" report to a national "top doctor." For this reason, it's **often clearest to talk about federal and provincial counterparts** (e.g., "top doctors" or "top public health officers" across the country). They're all members of the **Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health**, which is part of the [Pan-Canadian Public Health Network](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phn-rsp.ca%2Findex-eng.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0M77cLVHijEub1Bag-jnGU) — a technical detail rarely necessary in any routine coverage. Canada's chief public health officer runs the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fpublic-health%2Fcorporate%2Forganizational-structure%2Fcanada-chief-public-health-officer%2Frole-chief-public-health-officer.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0rKS59g68xUXSdItBPDYw6), which was created in part to respond to national public health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks.

### Trade names

**Trade names, trademarks, etc.**

[Verify case by case](/home/t/trade-names#verify) (Skip the dictionary, use government database)

[Prefer generic but natural](/home/t/trade-names#generic) (tissue, cola not Kleenex, Coke; but Jell-O, Frisbees)

[**List of commonly encountered trade names, trademarks**](/home/t/trade-names#list) (Aspirin to Zamboni)

[Avoid medial madness, logo lunacy](/home/t/trade-names#medial) (Teleprompter, Scrabble not TelePrompTer, SCRABBLE)



**Overview**

**Some companies have legal ownership over certain words. These terms generally require capital letters at the start** to flag them as commercial assets. **Trademarks are distinctive logos or words** (slogans or names) **that are legally registered** in a specific jurisdiction. **Sometimes a trademark is a single word and/or logo.** In other cases, it's a comparatively complex cluster. **Brand names can also have this protection. They're often called "trade names," although in Canada a "trade name" traditionally refers to a registered company name.**

**Investors can be very territorial about proprietary terms.** They often don't want "their" words to appear in lowercase. They want to preserve a brand name, not hurl it into a sea of generic labels.

**When common words are no longer associated with specific products, proprietary status can vanish.** This is referred to as _debasement_. For instance, a capital L is no longer needed in "**laundromat**" because the name is now considered a generic term for a coin-operated laundry, and the capital C in "**cellophane**" has been similarly washed away. Another example is "**dumpster**," which used to be written as Dumpster because it was based on the name of a waste disposal system patented by a U.S. company, Dempster Brothers. The portmanteau (from the word dump and the family name Dempster) was legally protected for more than half a century. But the capital D has since been tossed away, and "dumpster" is now considered a generic word for any large, outside waste bin. **Although debasement often leads to lowercase renderings, proper noun elements sometimes retain initial capitals** (e.g., referring to any folding wall bed as a **Murphy bed**) based on familiar usage. In those instances, the capital letter is not proprietary but merely eponymous.



**Verify case by case**

When deciding whether to capitalize, **the first step is verifying facts. Don't use a proprietary name** (e.g., a business installing Plexiglas) **when you're actually referring to a generic product** (e.g., a business installing a generic acrylic sheet, commonly known as "plexiglass").

**Accuracy matters.** If someone sends you an email and refers to "kleenex" instead of **Kleenex**, no one is going to sue. But if you write "kleenex" on CBC.ca, millions of people may see it, including a few lawyers. And you're dreaming in **Technicolor** (note the "T") if you think you can safely ignore all capital letters on a whim. **The digital era has made it easier for companies to spot improper or unauthorized use of registered names.** Free, unsophisticated computer apps can now send them alerts whenever a certain word or phrase appears in news stories.

**Dictionaries are not the best guide for trade names.** Lexicographers don't always acknowledge the words with capital letters. And some terms have protection in one country but not another (**Aspirin in Canada**, for instance, but **aspirin in the United States**). Even when trade names are included in dictionaries, there are lags between the loss of proprietary status and the appearance of small letters in updated editions of reference books.

**CBC News uses the [Canadian Trademarks Database](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ic.gc.ca%2Fapp%2Fopic-cipo%2Ftrdmrks%2Fsrch%2Fhome&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0DYqUWlY2JMIRzZVNgtlso)** as our primary source to determine which trade names remain under protection. **A few dozen proprietary terms** that appear in news copy with some frequency are [**listed below**](/home/t/trade-names#list)

**Be aware that not all registered names and certification marks need to be capitalized.** In particular, if an expression such as "disclaimed apart from the certification mark" appears in the above database's entry, lowercase rendering is generally fine in our journalism. This disclaimer often signals that **COMMON words capitalized in a name, logo or other graphical representation constituting a trademark do not have to be treated the same way in ordinary writing or speech.** Two separate complaints to CBC News over the years illustrate these differences. The occupational designation of **Realtor** requires a capital R because the UNIQUE noun continues to enjoy special proprietary status. By contrast, the everyday occupational designations of **certified orthotist** and **certified prosthetist** can be reported lowercase, in the same way we'd refer to chartered accountants, licensed architects, registered nurses, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, etc.


**Prefer generic but natural**

**It's best to avoid trade names when possible** (write "_tissue_" not Kleenex, "_cola_" not Coke, "_disinfectant_" not Lysol, "_bleach_" not Javex, "_jeans_" not Levi's, "_hot tub_" or _"whirlpool"_ not Jacuzzi, _"in-line skating"_ not Rollerblading, _"plastic bags"_ not Baggies, and so forth).

**But sometimes the most natural way to describe the world around us** — a world full of proprietary items that are difficult to describe generically — **is to say that the dog chased a Frisbee** (rather than a "plastic disc the size of a pie plate"), **or that the children ate Jell-O** (not a "gelatinous dessert"), as the Globe and Mail's style manual pointed out years ago.

That old advice remains valid today, which is why **people Google things** rather than "enter keywords into search engines." And it can be far too shackling to prohibit all proprietary words from being used in novel or creative ways, especially if certain constructions help make a story clearer or more engaging (e.g., describing a space gizmo that collects samples from the moon's surface as being like, say, **a giant lunar Roomba**, or calling a large beach-cleaning tractor **a kind of sand Zamboni**). Nevertheless, **when we're literally rather than figuratively referring to products, it's usually best to stick to generic phrasing** (e.g., "_ice resurfacing equipment_" or "_ice resurfacers_" instead of Zambonis), **unless we know the specific trade name is accurate** (e.g., "the rink spent half the money it raised from the raffle on an electric Zamboni").  


**Seek legal guidance as required**

**If you receive a formal complaint about alleged improper use of a proprietary term, do not ignore or dismiss the claim.** Options include verifying that capitalization is required and then revising, accordingly, or simply recasting with a lowercase, generic synonym.

**If the complaint is about more than simply capitalization** (e.g., a company or person is demanding we not use a proprietary term in a given context), **it's best to contact the [CBC Law Department](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fio.cbcrc.ca%2F%23%2Fresources%2Fcontacts-for-all-lawyers-coordonnees-de-tous-les-avocats-1.3096758&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3w_B4CnHUS7T9u7Wl_dGqe) for guidance**, including possible help drafting whatever response we, as a corporation, may decide is appropriate. The internal GMail is **lawdepartment@cbc.ca**.

**Be aware that companies may sometimes make contestable or unreasonable demands**, such as removing properly capitalized proprietary terms from news stories simply because they don't like "their" names appearing in various contexts. Figurative expressions, in particular, are sources of debate (e.g., a Band-Aid solution that's temporary but not very good, a bumbling, unpopular Teflon politician nothing sticks to).

**There may be times when a rewrite request has merit** (e.g., if using one manufacturer's name to describe another company's new product might cause confusion). **But before revising a script based solely on a company's complaint** about alleged improper use of a proprietary name, **consult the Law Department if you have any doubts.** Relevant factors to consider include entrenched English usage, acceptable figurative speech and journalistic purpose (e.g., clear imagery in a radio script).

**Don't go overboard with capitalization**. We've had email complaints, for instance, insisting that it's "Jumbo Jet." But it's not (and never was). It's jumbo jet as outlined in the Words: Woe & Wonder column [Jumbo Jets and other Jargon](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews2%2Findepth%2Fwords%2Fjumbo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2a9FlPFQnNoWSvI_j4lnCK).

**When the legal protection disappears, the capital letters should go too.** Until 2003, for instance, The Canadian Press recommended **TV Dinner**. It's now **TV dinner**. Other examples are **yo-yo** and **trampoline**, as well as laundromat, cellophane and dumpster, as noted in the [overview](/home/t/trade-names#overview) above.


**NOTE:** If a proprietary term is causing confusion but is not in the Language Guide, forward the information to [CBC's standards editor](/contact-us) to help buttress accuracy and consistency.

**Avoid medial madness, logo lunacy**

A final point: **We ignore most "medial" capitals** (i.e., those BigLetTers shoved in the middle of words as a marketing gimmick). So while CP suggests **TelePrompTer**, for instance, we agree with the Globe and Mail and type **Teleprompter**. Exceptions are less-jarring spellings, such as fused names with only one capital letter in the middle (e.g., PowerPoint, WestJet, WikiLeaks).

We also write [words, not logos](/home/n/names-versus-logos). So it's **ReMax Canada** and **Yahoo**, _not_ _RE/MAX Canada_ and _Yahoo!_ featuring special characters like slashes and exclamation marks. See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for related guidelines (**Scrabble** and **Visa**, not SCRABBLE and VISA, but **eBay**, **iMac**, etc.)

### transgender

**Transgender**


[Pronouns](/home/t/transgender#pronouns) (he, she, 'they' as a singular)
[Transition, transitioning](/home/t/transgender#transition) (e.g., gender surgery)
[Former names, misstated ID/gender](/home/t/transgender#former-names) ('deadnaming' and 'misgendering')

[Miscellaneous](/home/t/transgender#miscellaneous) ('-der' not '-dered,' trans)
[Tautology vs. clarity](/home/t/transgender#tautology) (axe awkward clutter)

**TRANSGENDER** commonly refers to someone who **identifies with a gender** **that doesn't match the person's biological classification at birth**. They may or may not decide to alter their bodies through hormone therapy or other medical procedures. Transgender **also refers in a broader way to someone whose identity does not narrowly conform to conventional notions of female or male.** Instead, they combine or move between traditional classifications according to individual expressions of gender identity.

Avoid including this detail in stories unless it's directly relevant.

**Gender vs. sex**
Common **GENDER** classifications: **woman, man, non-binary**
Common **SEX** classifications: **female, male**

English is in constant flux. For more than half a millennium, "gender" applied primarily to grammar (e.g., masculine or feminine nouns, pronouns), and "sex" referred to anatomical classifications (i.e., male and female), which, in turn, simply reflected reproductive organs. But **roughly a century ago, "gender" became increasingly common as a synonym for "sex,"** especially after the latter started being used more frequently to mean intercourse, according to the 2015 Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage.

**In recent decades, "gender" has taken on a much narrower meaning in scholarly circles, where it's used to describe "socially constructed" characteristics of men and women** (e.g., traditional norms, roles and relationships within a society, which are unfixed and largely taught/learned). **This has led to inconsistency and misunderstanding.** As the 2007 Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage puts it:


> _"Many people today use 'gender' as a synonym for 'sex.' \[But many academic writers\] ... use 'gender' to refer to the roles and characteristics associated with men and women by society, and 'sex' to refer to characteristics that can be classified as anatomical, genetic, or biological; this distinction can be useful."_


**In our journalism, we usually distinguish between sex** (biological classification) **and gender** (personal identity), **especially if using the terms interchangeably causes confusion** (e.g., in stories about transgender rights). **The entrenched practice of using "gender" and "sex" as synonyms in some contexts can be OK when there's no ambiguity** (e.g., **gender equality, gender gaps** in hiring and pay, **gender stereotypes**). This includes references to "gender" details on certain government ID, such as a driver's licence or passport — not only because such usage is established, but because some jurisdictions now have options beyond just M and F (e.g., "X" for non-binary identity as well as for undisclosed gender identity).

**However, the word "sex" should be our default term for biological classifications.** A 2021 ombudsman complaint about the discovery of two badly decomposed corpses in a downtown Toronto apartment illustrates preferred usage. We reported that the "gender" of one of the bodies could not be determined when we should have said that the "sex" could not be determined. Although medical examiners can virtually always tell what reproductive organs people were born with, they cannot objectively ascertain gender identities.


**CONVENTIONAL SYNTAX:** (i) **The biological classifications of male and female are commonly used as adjectives** (e.g., _a female athlete, a male nurse_), when this detail is considered relevant to the story. The test should be whether adding "female" or "male" is essential to our audience's understanding of a given report, as well as whether we're treating both sexes equally (e.g., if we wouldn't routinely refer to a "male" doctor or judge, then we shouldn't routinely refer to a "female" doctor or judge either). (ii) **The gender identities of man and woman are commonly used as nouns** (e.g., _a missing man, a Winnipeg woman_). Be aware that **some people prefer to use the word woman as an adjective, too**, in order to stress gender over biology (e.g., _a woman athlete, a woman construction worker_). **But sentences can wind up lacking parallel construction** because the word man is rarely used an adjective in the same way (e.g., _a man athlete, a man construction worker_). **One workaround is to recast phrasing to avoid inconsistency** (e.g., _She is the only woman on an otherwise all-man space crew_).




**Sex/gender assigned at birth**
**Entrenched references to biological classification at birth are not considered transphobic when used in generic contexts** (e.g., "They're expecting a baby girl" and "She gave birth to a boy"). Calling infants "girls" and "boys" conventionally implies sex assignment rather than actual gender identification. **Some transgender people object to this language, however, in stories about them. Be respectful.** In particular, take into account the following:

-   **Polarizing expressions like "born a boy" and "born female" are often unnecessary.** Such detail is sometimes obvious from context. For instance:

> > DISPUTED WORDING: _He came up with the idea for the special swimsuit when he and his daughter, who was born a boy, were getting ready for a trip to Central America._
>
>
>
> > REWRITE: _He came up with the idea for the special swimsuit when he and his daughter, who is transgender, were getting ready for a trip to Central America._

-   **If detail about sex at birth is deemed essential, use the least-wordy, most conversational phrasing possible** — keeping in mind that such constructions tend to sound relatively clinical no matter how they're phrased. For instance:

> > POOR (verbose, awkward): _She was assigned the classification of male at birth_.
>
> >
> > BETTER (less wordy, more direct): _She was born with male sex organs_.
>
> >
> > POTENTIALLY BEST (as long as the individual doesn't object): _She was born with the body of a boy_.

-   **Avoid inaccuracies**, such as claiming someone was "born a man" or "born a woman." **People are not born as adults**, and using "man" or "woman" to mean male genitalia and female genitalia at birth offends people fighting to educate society about gender identification. 

**NOTE: The modifier "biological" can be problematic in stories about gender** for two reasons: (i) **It can emphasize sexual classification in a way that supplants the individual's own gender identity** (e.g., calling a trans woman a "biological male" or a trans man a "biological female"); and (ii) **It can oversimplify the actual science of sex.**

Be aware that **some opponents of transgender rights use the term "biological" in misleading ways.** Their language presumes communities are monolithic, ignoring the reality that some transgender people may have undergone a range of medical treatment, from hormone therapy to surgery, which complicates the semantics debate over the meaning of the modifier "biological" in this context. For instance, does being "male" depend on having a penis or having a certain level of testosterone? Does it rely on the presence of X and Y chromosomes in a scientific age that can document sex development differences in some "boys" and "girls," including a condition known as androgen insensitivity syndrome? Our recommended style: **Outside of attribution, limit use of terms like biological male and biological female to scientific stories**, such as reports on medical research, zoology, animal physiology, etc.


**Pronouns**
**Adopt pronouns used by the transgender person** (he, his, him, she, her, hers). If an established practice is unknown, go with pronouns that reflect how the person lives publicly (e.g., wording used by them on social media, biographical details on an employer's website). **Some transgender people** do not identify as either male or female and **use the plural pronoun "they" in a singular form** (they, them, theirs, [themself](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/they_singular/#themself "They_singular")). **We should respect this choice while being mindful of clarity.** This means:

-   **If it's obvious a story is referring to one person, as is often the case, there's no need to add additional detail** (e.g., to specifically point out that the individual uses "they," "them" and "their"). **But if it's not clear from context, it's a good idea to briefly explain why the plural pronoun is singular** (e.g., "Smith, who uses the pronoun 'they,' says ..." ) If such background is deemed relevant, keep it as brief as possible, and convey it in the spirit of practical consideration, the way someone might add a "she/her" or "they/them" pronoun signature to the bottom of an email.

-   **If one or more sentences are potentially confusing, it can be helpful to consider recasting** without third person pronouns when practical (e.g., "Smith's" instead of "theirs"), **especially in broadcast scripts**, which can be challenging for the ear.

**Do not use less common non-binary pronouns** (e.g., zhe, yo, xe, ve, thon, hu, ey). It's OK to report that a given person prefers a neologism like "zhe" or "hu" in a story. But attempting to actually construct an entire report using such words introduces major challenges — from nailing down pronunciation to determining case form (e.g., if "zhe" is chosen as the nominative "she" and "he" equivalent, then you must also decide on the accusative "her" and "him" equivalents, as well as on the possessive "hers" and "his" forms).

**Aim for consistent pronoun use for the same person within a story.** If someone has no set preference for singular or plural, go with what the individual uses most often. **If someone asks us to use a mix of pronouns** (e.g., alternating between singular and plural), **request that the person pick one approach in a given report to avoid confusion.** When balancing respect for an individual's identity against the need for audience clarity, keep in mind that there are alternative ways to present information to avoid inconsistency (e.g., limiting the use of pronouns by using the possessive form of a person's name as noted above).


**CAUTION: The word PREFER has more than one meaning in English.** For centuries it's been defined as "to favour" as well as "to choose." **In the context of transgender language, "prefer" virtually always means** the latter — i.e., **usage chosen** by individual members of the transgender community. Avoid implying that decisions about names, pronouns, etc., are merely favoured options. Rather, such "preferences" are **designated language choices**. To avoid confusion, **stick to unambiguous wording in stories**. For example: "British pop star Sam Smith **uses the pronouns** 'they/them' ... " (NOT "prefers the pronouns 'they/them' ...").


See also "[**they as a singular pronoun**](/home/t/they_singular)" for general grammar guidelines.


**Transition, transitioning** (e.g., gender surgery)
The verb **transition** has become a common way to describe embracing a gender identity (i.e., male/female) that's different from one's biological classification at birth. The participle is **transitioning**. These **terms do not have to be defined in stories**, as long as the context makes their meaning clear. **Transitioning may or may not involve medical procedures**, broadly known as **gender-affirming care** — from hormone therapy and electrolysis to various types of surgery. There can be a wide range of reasons against medical treatment, from personal choice (e.g., happiness with one's own body) to financial costs, physical and emotional concerns, and other barriers. 

**When referring to surgery, generally prefer short, fact-based descriptions** (e.g., **gender surgery, transgender surgery**). While terms such as **gender-affirming** and **gender-confirming** procedures are OK, especially if they're the choice of a given transgender person, be aware that not all members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community use or endorse these labels for various reasons. **Avoid the dated term "reassignment" surgery**, which critics say wrongly implies that an external authority is reclassifying an individual. Exceptions should be attributed (e.g., when medical personnel mention "gender reassignment" in a transcribed quote). **Avoid the archaic expression "sex change" operation** outside of direct quotes (e.g., verbatim references to historical documents).

**It's rarely necessary to use obscure jargon when referring to surgery** (e.g., vaginectomy, gaginoplasty, penectomy, phalloplasty). **Common descriptions are clearer and generally satisfactory** (e.g., facial surgery, breast surgery, genital reconstruction), assuming this level of clinical detail is even relevant to given coverage (e.g, something has gone wrong). The word surgery alone is normally sufficient in second reference.


**Former names, misstated ID/gender**
**We don't usually refer to anyone's former name unless the detail is directly relevant** to a story. This kind of **information is rarely pertinent** (e.g., Woody Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg). For details, see: [Names — Common versus legal](/home/n/names_common).

The **bar is higher for transgender people**, since names are directly tied to gender identity. **We almost always use their current, preferred names.** This generally applies **even if someone is charged with a crime and court documents list a different legal name**. Reporting it usually serves little public interest compared to the personal pain associated with unilaterally resurrecting an abandoned gender identity. **Exceptions are rare** (e.g., a case of fraud involving alleged use of false IDs and personas). A key test is whether the birth name is fundamental or merely incidental to fully understand the story.

**Public figures are in a special category. Limited references to former names are sometimes OK**, based largely on audience familiarity. For instance, **Caitlyn Jenner** should be referred to either as **a woman** or as a transgender woman when the latter is relevant. But **imposing an outright ban against periodically mentioning certain biographical detail would be far too restrictive**. Therefore, it's **potentially OK to point out that her birth name was Bruce Jenner**, that she won Olympic gold medals as a male decathlete, etc., **as long as this background is germane to given coverage**. But this does not mean that public figures' past identities can be inserted into stories capriciously. The editorial threshold of demonstrable relevance must still be met. **When a public figure already known by one name and gender suddenly switches to another name and gender, audience recognition becomes a consideration.** This normally means referring to both identities in coverage during a transition period to keep our journalism clear. The [Bradley/Chelsea Manning case](/updates/2013/2013-08-23) in August 2013 is an example. NOTE: **Using a transgender person's former name sparingly for historical context, etc., does not mean using old pronouns**, which is as unnecessary as it is potentially offensive (e.g., Jenner's Olympic accomplishments remain "hers" not "his").

**Be aware that jargon like "deadnaming" and "misgendering" can be problematic** for various reasons. **Deadname means former name** (often a **birth name**). The term is **potentially confusing** because it's not well known. Also, **"deadname" is not embraced by all transgender people for various reasons** — including the emotional connection some maintain to a former identity that they say helped shape them. So while many individuals we talk to may be comfortable labelling their past identities as "dead," others might feel differently. It's **one more reason that entrenched, fact-based, instantly recognizable expressions like "former" name and "birth" name tend to be preferred by careful writers.** The transitive verb **misgender means "to mistake or misstate a person's gender"** — including the use of pronouns that clash with the individual's expressed gender identity. But **misgender**, coined in 1989, **remains relatively obscure and potentially jarring**, especially in broadcast scripts, since "gender" is not normally used as a verb. **The same is true of the noun "misgendering," which is neither conversational nor crystal clear** to a general audience.


**Cisgender**
An increasingly common word to describe **someone who is not transgender**. It's **OK in news stories as long as the meaning is obvious from context.** Otherwise, the word should be briefly defined. **Never use terms such as normal** to describe someone who gender identity matches their sex classification at birth. 

Bear in mind that most people who are not transgender do not call themselves "cisgender." Be aware, too, that **some people do not want to be referred to as cisgender.** This preference should be respected. The alternative **"non-transgender"** is as common, neutral and unambiguous as many other "non-" terms, including non-Indigenous and non-binary. It's **sometimes** **both clearer and more conversational to say something like "people who are not transgender"** or "people outside the transgender community," rather than to refer to the majority of the population as "cisgender." While non-transgender is an option in certain contexts, **there can be other ways to cast sentences.** For instance: "_Actors like Eddie Redmayne and Jared Leto have won Oscars for playing transgender characters without actually being transgender, themselves_," rather than, "_Non-transgender actors like Eddie Redmayne and Jared Leto have won Oscars for playing transgender characters._"

**Cisgender can be a convenient, succinct way to report certain facts** (e.g., in a story on medical research that distinguishes between, say, cisgender women and transgender populations). **However, it may not always be the clearest choice.** In a story about some parents falsely accusing a young teen of violating a gender-specific sports tournament's rules by competing as a girl, for instance, it would be accurate to report that "the girl is cisgender," but it might not be as meaningful to our overall audience as simply reporting that "the girl is not transgender."


**HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:** More than a century ago, **"cis" was occasionally used to flag something "on one side" of a boundary or place** (e.g., cis-Atlantic instead of mid-Atlantic or trans-Atlantic). **But the prefix was never as popular as "trans,"** which was embedded in dozens of words that continue to be used today (e.g., transit, transfer, transfix, transfuse, translate, transmit, transpire, transport). **The label cisgender, itself, was first embraced by the transgender community in the 1990s**, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Some people believe "cisgender" was coined earlier, although lexicographical facts are unclear.




**Miscellaneous** ('-der' not '-dered,' trans)
**Never equate gender identification or gender change with sexual orientation.** As scholar Susan Stryker puts it in the 2017 edition of her book _Transgender History_: "A transgender man could be gay or straight or bi ... just as he could be Black or poor or disabled."

Transgender is a noun and adjective (e.g., a **transgender person**). For consistency, stick with "-der" rather than "-dered." **Avoid "transgendered."**

The shorthand **"trans" is increasingly common and acceptable in second reference** in certain contexts (e.g., a **trans activist**). But be aware that trans conveys a breezy tone that may not always be suitable, depending on the story. Use your own judgment. (See also [tautology vs. clarity](/home/t/transgender#tautology) below) With the exception of directly transcribed quotes, **generally steer clear of other clipped forms, such as "tranny,"** because they can be confusing and/or offensive.

Don't confuse the word transgender **with cross-dressing**. Also, **use the word [cross-dresser](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#glossary-cross-dresser "2SLGBTQ+") instead of transvestite**, which is widely considered outmoded.

**Avoid the outdated term hermaphrodite**, which historically referred to people with male and female reproductive organs who could not be clearly classified as either boy or girl at birth. While the word has gradually been replaced by terms like "**intersexual**" and  [**intersex**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/#glossary-intersex "2SLGBTQ+") person, the latter are still not widely known and often imply an intermediate stage or change after birth. For this reason, **specific descriptions rather than labels are often clearest** (e.g., "He was born with both male and female genitals").


**Tautology vs. clarity**
**Remove awkward clutter**, such as the expression "female to male," when the same information is already conveyed by other detail or context. For instance:

### **Awkward and unnecessary wording**

_Going to the washroom has never been easy for Bob Doe. While the female to male transgender student makes no secret about identifying as a man, finding a safe bathroom has been a problem._

### Preferred, shorter wording

_Going to the washroom has never been easy for Bob Doe. While the transgender student makes no secret about identifying as a man, finding a safe bathroom has been a problem._

**Avoid adding the nouns "man" or "woman" to sentences unnecessarily**, especially when the **transgender person** at the heart of a given story openly opposes these binary classifications. For example, transgender teacher, transgender actor, transgender politicians, etc., all convey detail without specifying male or female. In many cases, standard pronouns fill in blanks. (See also [pronouns](/home/t/transgender#pronouns) above) When the compounds **transgender man** and **transgender woman** are used, generally spell them out in full unless transcribing direct quotes. Be aware that certain shorthand forms, such as **trans man** and **trans woman**, can be jarring and unintentionally change a story's tone to a wider audience. (See [miscellaneous](/home/t/transgender#miscellaneous) above)

See [2SLGBTQ+](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/2slgbtq/ "2SLGBTQ+") for related guidelines.

### Transliterations

**Transliterations**

**There's no such thing as a single correct transliteration, since we're trying to represent one word with the closest corresponding letters found in another language's alphabet.** In Arabic, for instance, terms such as _al-Din_ (the Religion) can be written as _ed-Din_, _ed-dine, uddin_, etc.

**Sometimes words are pronounced differently depending on the region, which can lead to different spellings. In addition, certain conventions don't apply in some places.** For instance, Muslim countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan are not actually Arabic but, for religious reasons, they use some Arabic names. These spellings have taken their own paths over the centuries.


**Entrenched usage and known preferences**
English is full of foreign words that have been altered in a variety of ways, from French, Russian, German and Chinese to Algonquian, Cree and Mi'kmaq. **Traditional spellings and common pronunciations often play a large role, especially for generic terms.
**
The Inuktut word _inukshuk_, for instance, features an "sh" sound in most parts of English Canada. The alternative spelling _inuksuk_ is far less common. Also, the plural inukshuks is much more familiar than the Inuktut-inspired plurals "_inuksugait_" or "_inuksuit_." Despite periodic complaints from people with expertise in any given tongue, the CBC's preference for an entrenched form such as **inukshuk** (plural **inukshuks**) does not represent ignorance, inaccuracy or disrespect. Rather, it reflects familiar usage. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary and Nunavut's Inuktitut Living Dictionary both list inukshuk as the primary English spelling. It's important to remember that we report in English, and that English is a melting pot of other languages. So for generic words, such as inukshuk, we normally stick with what's entrenched because it's the English version that's clearest to our audience.

**Proper nouns are treated in a different way**, however. In the case of names, **if someone has adopted a specific spelling in English, use that preference. If there's no personal preference but a particular spelling has been established through usage, follow that.**
**Audience recognition is crucial**. In historical references, for example, always include the most established English name at least once in brackets for clarity (e.g., "_Pîhtokahanapiwiyin, widely known as [Chief Poundmaker](/home/p#Chief-Poundmaker), was_ ...").

See [Indigenous spellings and phonetics](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/i/indigenous/#spellings "Indigenous") for related guidelines (e.g., **saskatoon berry** comes from the Cree word _**misâskwatômin**_).


**Check CBC Language Guide first, then look to CP**
Reuters, AP, AFP and others can have significantly different approaches to the same names. (At the start of the U.S.-led attack against Iraq in 2003, for instance, Reuters picked _Tareq_ and AFP _Tarek_ for the person AP and CBC called "_Tariq_ Aziz.")

**Always consult the CBC News Language Guide first.** For example, we use the Reuters preference _Kim Jong-il_ instead of _AP's Kim Jong Il_ for North Korea's former leader, partly because the latter looks too much like roman numerals. And we use _KHL_ for _Russia's Kontinental Hockey League_ because the Cyrillic K helps avoid confusion with Canada's _CHL_.
**In general, we follow Canadian Press transliterations when they're available. Exceptions are listed on this website** (e.g., CP now uses the AP spelling _al-Qaida_, but after years of writing _al-Qaeda_ we're sticking with the latter). **If the word you're looking for is not in the Language Guide and no CP references can be found, look to AP for guidance before Reuters.**

**Be cautious when using your own spellings**
**It's difficult and unwise to devise transliterations on your own. If you can't find a transliteration from a reliable source but want to quote someone** (for instance, a radio reporter has filed a script with only a phonetic spelling of an individual's name), **transcribe the clip and then consider using generic attribution** (e.g., "according to a government official," or "said one Iraqi man as he joined the protest in the heart of Baghdad").


**Some transliterations are in transition** (Kyiv versus Kiev)
**Preferred transliterations can change over time. _Kyiv_ and _Chornobyl_, for instance**, are considered closer to Ukrainian than Kiev and Chernobyl, which were based on Russian. CBC News, CP and many others now use Kyiv and Chornobyl. **Other examples are _Kolkata_**  (instead of _Calcutta_ ) because it's a better approximation of the original Bengali name, **and _Mumbai_**  (instead of _Bombay_ ), which more accurately reflects the local Indian language. "Bombay" is considered a corrupted English version of the old Portuguese name for the city, and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule. (See also [cities around the world](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld).)

The preferred transliterations above refer to proper geographical names. Other entrenched usage, such as a recipe for **chicken Kiev**, is unchanged. This matches our approach to, say, a dish of **Peking duck** — even though the old name Peking was switched to Beijing back in the 1980s, based on China's preference for the Pinyin spelling system. The same is true of **Bollywood**, the ubiquitous nickname for India's Hindi cinema. Critics of the word point out that it's a portmanteau of "Bombay" and "Hollywood," and that the city's name is now officially Mumbai. But the term [Bollywood](/home/b#Bollywood) remains widely used and acceptable in stories about the film industry, specific dance choreography, etc., because it's so entrenched.

We prize consistency and don't want to revise words willy-nilly when there's no consensus that a proposed transliteration is more accurate. **When a different spelling surfaces and competes with the established one, the news service's [standards editor](/contact-us) rules on whether to abandon the old for the new.**

### TRC

**Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada**

Formal name (not required in stories): Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada

**Common and preferred name**, even in first reference: **Truth and Reconciliation Commission**, as long as the story makes it instantly obvious that the commission was Canadian and focused on residential schools (e.g., "_Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission examining residential schools_"). Since other countries have had their own commissions with similar names (e.g., South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up after the end of apartheid), this context is key to serve our audience.

**Second reference: the commission,** or **the TRC**

It was set up in 2008. Justice Murray Sinclair chaired the commission, which issued its [final report in 2015](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Ftruth-and-reconciliation-commission-urges-canada-to-confront-cultural-genocide-of-residential-schools-1.3096229&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw13yvsxoxfrzief-sCoDRZl). Material collected by the TRC is now housed at the **National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba**. These archives include everything from thousands of statements by former students to previously sealed court documents about the way the schools were run.

**Do not imply that the TRC was a parliamentary commission or suggest that the commission was judicial** or even quasi-judicial. **The TRC's goal was not to assign blame or determine guilt.** Rather, it was to create a historical account of a significant part of the country's past still unknown to many of its citizens, to help victims heal, and to encourage reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established as part of a court-approved agreement between survivors of residential schools, the churches that ran them, the federal government and various Indigenous organizations. It was an independent body that heard the stories of anyone affected by the failed and destructive assimilation policy of residential schools. Participation was voluntary. A banner on the commission's original website summed up a great deal: "For the child taken, for the parent left behind."

Grammatically, the compound "**truth and reconciliation**" is conventionally considered a [composite theme](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/v/verb-agreement/#themes "Verb agreement"), which means it's **commonly treated as a singular subject** (e.g., _truth and reconciliation begins_ ... _means_ ... _is_ ...).

### Treaty

**Treaty versus treaty**

**Generally capitalize only when referring to the formal names of agreements or other proper nouns:**

a treaty
Canada's tax treaty with China
Treaty 4
Treaty 6 (not Six)
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
the Office of the Treaty Commissioner in Saskatchewan


**But also capitalize when an informal name is treated like a proper noun based on convention:
**
the Nisga'a Treaty
the Nisga'a Land Treaty

A "T" is used in the above examples because these compounds are more common than the actual name, "the [Nisga'a Final Agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flaws-lois.justice.gc.ca%2Feng%2Facts%2Fn-23.3%2FFullText.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0QDB08lKfhgSKhYxpRMOQ7)."

**This includes abridged versions of formal names:**

the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty
the 1752 Treaty
a Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed on March 10, 1760 in Halifax.

**Generic plural constructions are normally lowercase:**

the treaties
peace treaties


**But capitalize specific plural forms treated as distinct proper nouns based on convention:**

the Peace and Friendship Treaties
Treaties 4 and 6

### trial versus hearing

**Trial versus hearing** (after guilty plea)

The word trial implies resolution of a dispute (criminal or civil) in a court of law. In Canada, criminal trials are associated with arguments by the prosecution and the defence.

**In the case of a guilty plea at the start of criminal proceedings**, however, the term **"trial" is no longer suitable. At that point, "hearing" is a better choice**, as the Crown presents an agreed statement of facts to the judge, who will then decide whether to accept the guilty plea. **Until the plea is accepted, the accused is not formally convicted.**

Depending on the amount of information presented, this stage can take several days. If the judge accepts the plea, a conviction is officially entered in the books and the sentencing phase (known as the "**sentencing hearing**") begins.

### tuque versus toque

**Tuque versus toque**

**tuque**
**Tuque is the preferred Canadian spelling of the knitted cap worn in winter.**
_
“They ran so hard across the snowy field their faces were as red as their tuques.”_

The term tuque is French Canadian. Some etymologists think it probably comes from an Old Spanish word (_toca_) for a type of headdress — specifically, a soft, close-fitting cap worn about 500 years ago.


**toque**
**Toque is the spelling we use for some other types of headwear. But these are rarely mentioned in news stories.**

Toques include conical or plumed hats from previous centuries, the tall white crowns worn by chefs, and modern snug hats that fall into the rather vague category of high-fashion.

### Taiwan

**Turkey vs. 'Türkiye'**

**Use the traditional English spelling and pronunciation** of the republic known for the past century as **"Turkey."**

In the spring of 2022, the government in Ankara asked other countries to adopt **the Turkish spelling ("Türkiye")** and pronunciation (**"TUR-kee-yeh"**) to disassociate the proper noun from the lowercase homograph "turkey." Organizations such as the UN, NATO and the IOC embraced the change within months. As of December 2022, however, most major English news organizations had maintained the customary spelling and pronunciation.

Although we may eventually adopt Türkiye, depending on how familiar the name becomes, **we continue to use Turkey for now because it's clearest to our audience, and because we report in English using established spelling and phonetic conventions.** It's why we refer to **Spain, Belgium** and **Poland** instead of to **España, Belgique** and **Polska**, why we describe **Munich** being in **Germany** rather than **München** being in **Deutschland**, why we prefer **Ivory Coast** and the **Magdalen Islands** over **Côte d'Ivoire** and **Îles-de-la-Madeleine**, and why we use common, anglicized pronunciations of places like **Paris** and **Mexico**.

Country names do change, of course. **Iran, Thailand** and **Zimbabwe** used to be known as **Persia, Siam** and **Rhodesia**, respectively. In this case, however, Turkey has not actually switched to a different proper noun. In fact, it's been known as **Türkiye Cumhuriyeti** (the **Republic of Turkey**) since being founded after the First World War. Instead, the country's government is asking people to stop using a common English version of its name.

The case is arguably different from an old transliteration being updated — such as when **Beijing** replaced **Peking**, **Mumbai** replaced **Bombay**, and **Kyiv** replaced **Kiev** — because of the nature of the objection to "Turkey" looking and sounding like the completely different word "turkey." It's also not comparable to the **Czech Republic** encouraging the world to start using the name **"Czechia"** back in 2016, a name that still hasn't gained much popularity.

It's worth noting that the Turkish spelling, Türkiye, and accompanying phonetic are based on a different alphabet with 29 letters, rather than merely on a slight variation of the roman alphabet using a diacritical marking. See **[non-English words, foreign languages, accents](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/f/foreign-words/#roman_alphabet "Foreign words")** for related guidelines (e.g., we refer to Latvia's military based as **Camp Adazi** instead of as **Camp Ādaži** for the same reason that Latvian media refer to **New Brunswick** and **Canada** as **Ņūbransvika** and **Kanāda**).

  **COMPREHENSIVE MANUAL AVAILABLE:** This Language Guide page provides only brief answers to a few commonly asked questions about TV supers. For detailed direction on everything below and a lot more, see the latest **[CBC NEWS TV SUPERS STYLE GUIDE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-2sGp-PMA0T1OX8NM0OlodYwxjTl-elzh1cYJKgceeo/edit)** in Google Docs.

**Overview**
**TV text is unique in several ways.** Whether superimposed over other material (as a "super" or banner), or occupying the entire screen as a full-frame graphic, the words are:

-   **Temporary** (usually on the screen for just a few seconds); and
-   **Supplementary** (generally supporting images and audio, rather than serving as the primary source of information).

This means TV text should be:

> -   **Brief**  (There's only so much space on the screen.)
> -   **Clear**  (People don't have much time to scan the information.)
> -   **Synced**  (Words must match whatever else is being seen and/or heard, from locators to bullet-point graphics.)

But in other ways, TV text is not unique. **Like the rest of our journalism, it must also be:**

> -   **Accurate**  (Correct spellings, facts, figures, etc.)
> -   **Fair**  (Condensed without being misleading.)
> -   **Relevant**  (Help tell the story.)
> -   **Editorially consistent**  (Adhere to all CBC News guidelines, such as [anti-abortion](/home/a/abortion) instead of "pro-life" and [Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar) instead of "Burma.")
> -   **Stylistically consistent**  (Follow in-house style, such as [SCC](/home/s#SupremeCourt) instead of "SCOC" and [half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) instead of "half-staff.")

The rest of this entry answers frequently asked questions about specific style points — from capitalizing descriptions in TV supers to spelling geographical locators.


**FAQs**
**1\. Is everyone identified?**
**The list of people we don't traditionally super on TV is very short.** It can vary slightly but is **usually limited to: Canada's monarch, current Governor General and current prime minister; the current U.S. president; the pope. Otherwise, the standard practice is to add identifying text.** This includes supering previously high-profile politicians, such as former prime ministers, especially since they may be less widely recognized now than some movie stars, musicians, athletes or other celebrities.

**When identifying people on camera, names alone are sometimes sufficient to keep supers from becoming too cluttered.** For instance, if we're interviewing people who witnessed a tragedy, it's irrelevant whether they're a student, a pastry chef or an appellate court judge.  In those cases, a description such as **eyewitness** rather than an occupation, title, etc., can be helpful if the clip's content or context doesn't already make this clear. **Keep the best interests of our audience in mind.** For example, specific detail (**off-duty paramedic**) might well be better than a name alone or the vague label "eyewitness" in a story about a tragedy abroad that includes clips of a vacationing Canadian paramedic who pitched in to help treat the injured. Use common sense.


**2\. How do I know what to capitalize?**
Since TV text is not scanned in the same way as, say, words on a web page or in a newspaper, **certain conventions have been established**. In particular, **capital letters tend to be used at the start of more words on TV** than in our online journalism, especially in titles, occupations, etc., put next to (or under) names. **Sometimes, every principal word has a capital letter** because it's treated as a formal title, and **sometimes only the first letter is capitalized** to flag the start of what amounts to a description:


> **Former Defence Minister** rather than former defence minister
>
> **Head of Emergency Medicine** rather than head of emergency medicine
>
> **Criminal lawyer** rather than criminal lawyer
>
> **Rally organizer** rather than rally organizer


**This is the main typographical difference between TV text style and general CBCNews.ca style**, and it should be kept in mind when consulting any Language Guide entries about **[capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)**. For instance, while the [abbreviations overview](/home/a/abbreviations) points out that AIDS is spelled out as "acquired immune deficiency syndrome" on CBCNews.ca, a TV graphic might be considered easier to read as: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. **Latitude is allowed** based on entrenched TV text convention.



**3\. How do we handle words spelled in more than one way?**
**For consistency, almost always use one version.** For example:


> **colour** (not "color")
>
> **judgment** (not "judgement")
>
> **raccoon** (not "racoon")
>
> **travelling** (not "traveling")


Rare exceptions involve observed distinctions (e.g., [financial **adviser** versus financial **advisor**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/adviser/ "Adviser")). This includes differences between certain parts of speech (e.g., the [noun **licence** versus the verb **license**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/l/#licence-license "L")).

See the **[spelling overview](/home/s/spelling)** for details on how CBC News preferences are determined.

**Two of the biggest sources of confusion are:**

**(i) TRANSLITERATIONS** (e.g., **al-Qaeda** not "al-Qaida" and the **Qur'an** not the "Koran").
Traditional spellings and common pronunciations often play a large role. See the **[transliterations overview](/home/t/transliterations)** for details and more examples.

**(ii) U.S. GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, TITLES** (e.g., U.S. Labour Secretary not "Labor" Secretary)

**While U.S. spellings** (e.g., "Center" instead of "Centre" and "Color" instead of "Colour" and "Harbor" instead of "Harbour") **are retained in most proper nouns** (e.g., book and film titles, as well as building and geographical names), **foreign government departments, foreign political titles, etc., are not treated in the same way** because they're not unique (i.e., many countries have the equivalent of defence ministers and labour secretaries):


> Lincoln Centre
>
> Pearl Harbor
>
> The Color Purple
>
> **U.S. Defence Department** (not the U.S. "Defense" Department)
>
> **U.S. Defence Secretary** (not the U.S. "Defense" Secretary)
>
> **U.S. Labour Department** (not the U.S. "Labor" Department)
>
> **U.S. Labour Secretary** (not the U.S. "Labor" Secretary)


See **[defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre)** for details

**For perspective, when U.S. newspapers, broadcasters and other media report on Canada they follow an identical approach by sticking with "American spellings" throughout their stories**  — referring to Ottawa's "Defense Department" and "defense spending" rather than to its Defence Department and defence spending, as well as to a given province's "Labor Ministry" rather than to its Labour Ministry. In the U.S., reporters also write about "Labor Day" weekend celebrations (regardless of country) while on CBC it's always **Labour Day**, even in our coverage of the holiday south of the border.


**4\. Are there spelling guidelines for geographical locators?**
**Yes. For domestic place names** (cities, towns, lakes, rivers, etc.), consult the [**Canadian Geographical Names Database**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.rncan.gc.ca%2Fsearch-place-names%2Fsearch%3Flang%3Den&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2lOY1kZcpa3sVZHHX8XWOf) published by Natural Resources Canada. The database is looked after by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, which includes representatives from all provinces and territories, and is routinely updated as required. In rare cases, when CBC News prefers a different spelling or name than the one listed, exceptions are noted in our Language Guide's main A to Z indexes, as explained in our [**provinces and cities overview**](/home/p/provinces-and-cities). **For communities outside of Canada, the National Geographic Atlas of the World is generally a good source.** But **check the Language Guide for any spelling exceptions first** (e.g., we write **Bangkok, Dunkirk** and **Taipei)**. These exceptions are often English versions of local spellings that have become entrenched over time (e.g., **Rome** instead of "Roma" and **Damascus** not "Dimashq"). See [**cities around the world**](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld) for more details.

**Two of the biggest sources of confusion are:
**
**(i) TRANSLATIONS and SHIFTING TRANSLITERATIONS**
**Always prefer English conventions when entrenched.** In the case of translations, for example, this means using **Ivory Coast** instead of "Côte d'Ivoire" and **Cape Verde** instead of "Cabo Verde" based on widespread usage and audience familiarity. In the case of shifting [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), widespread adoption of revised local English spellings means:


> **Chennai** instead of "Madras" (India)
>
> **Chornobyl** instead of "Chernobyl" (Ukraine)
>
> **Kolkata** instead of "Calcutta"
>
> **Kyiv** instead of "Kiev"
>
> **Mumbai** instead of "Bombay"


**(ii) SHORT, COMMON NAMES versus LONG, FORMAL NAMES**
**It's OK to clip the wordy, formal names of many countries.** For example: **Afghanistan** (not the "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"), **China** (not the "People's Republic of China") and **Sri Lanka** (not the "Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka"). **In some cases, entrenched colloquial names serve our audience best** because they include details to avoid ambiguity (e.g., the compass points in **North Korea** and **South Korea**, which are more meaningful than the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and the "Republic of Korea"). See [**country names**](/home/g/geography-cities#citiesaroundtheworld) for details.


**Limit the focus of routine locators to providing a geographical marker** for our audience. This means generally steering clear of detail about political sovereignty, shifting military control, etc., such as "occupied." So go with "**Ramallah, West Bank**" rather than "Ramallah, occupied West Bank," even though the modifier "occupied" is frequently and accurately mentioned in a broadcast script, itself. The same approach is taken with occupied places such as [**Crimea**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/crimea/ "Crimea"), since the tight space constraints of locators make it virtually impossible to satisfactorily capture the complexities of fluid war zones and other disputed land around the globe.


**5\. What about accents?**
**Include diacritical markings in foreign names or words as long as:**

-   **They're accurate** (confirmed or already known); and
-   **No accent-free "English" versions are entrenched** (.e.g, Mexico instead of México).

This style was adopted by CBC News in March of 2019. Previously, only French accents were routinely included in our journalism.


> **Examples of ACCENTS**
>
> Céline Dion
>
> El Niño
>
> Gwìch’in
>
> Nil Köksal
>
> Plácido Domingo
>
> Saša Petricic
>
> **Examples of NO ACCENTS** (because of established English versions)
>
> Baha'i faith (not "Bahá'í faith")
>
> inukshuk (not "iñuksuk")
>
> Mexico (not "México")
>
> Munich (not "München")
>
> Peru (not "Perú")
>
> pinatas (not "piñatas")


See [foreign words](/home/f/foreign-words) for details.

NOTE: **Even French accents are sometimes left out, depending on certain entrenched English conventions:**

>
> communiqué
>
> exposé
>
> Hydro-Québec
>
> Le Journal de Montréal
>
> ménage à trois
>
> Montreal rather than "Montréal"
>

>
> Quebecor rather than Québecor
>
> resumé (single accent, rather than résumé)
>
> Sûreté du Québec
>
> tête-à-tête
>
> University of Montreal rather than Université de Montréal


See **[French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents)** in our English journalism for details.

**6\. Is it Lt.-Col or Lt-Col or LCol? Military ranks reviewed.**
**There are many ways to abbreviate military ranks.** Sometimes people fuse letters. Sometimes they add hyphens. Sometimes they include periods. So it's a myth that certain punctuation is right or wrong solely because a given government website or military manual features a specific style. It all boils down to in-house preference.

**CBC follows standard newsroom publishing conventions rather than the various idiosyncratic styles used by military services around the world**, including the Canadian Armed Forces. **The biggest differences are that we include periods, add ordinal numbers**, such as "1st" (first) and "2nd" (second), **and avoid obscure or unintuitive shorthand** by spelling out the words instead (e.g., Chief Warrant Officer instead of CWO):


> **Maj.-Gen.** (not "MGen") for Major-General
>
> **Lt.-Col.** (not "LCol") for Lieutenant-Colonel
>
> **2nd Lt.** (not "2Lt") for Second Lieutenant
>
> **Lt.-Cmdr.** (not "LCdr") for Lieutenant-Commander
>
> **Acting Sub-Lt.** (not "A/SLt") for Acting Sub-Lieutenant
>
> **Officer Cadet** (not "OCdt") for Officer Cadet


**For details and a complete list of Armed Forces abbreviations, see [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks).**

REMINDER: In our online journalism, unabbreviated ranks such as Major-General and Second Lieutenant would be lowercase (major-general, second lieutenant). But in TV text, initial capital letters are conventionally used far more often, as outlined in [FAQ 2](/home/t/tv_text#capitalization) above.

NOTE: **When someone no longer actively holds a rank, always supply this context by prominently adding a term such as "former" or "retired"** (e.g., Retired Gen. John de Chastelain). Avoid the U.S. convention of retaining certain people's titles without qualification even after they've left office. See the **[titles overview](/home/t/titles)** for details and other examples.

  **COMPREHENSIVE MANUAL AVAILABLE:** This Language Guide page provides only brief answers to a few commonly asked questions about TV supers. For detailed direction on everything below and a lot more, see the latest **[CBC NEWS TV SUPERS STYLE GUIDE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-2sGp-PMA0T1OX8NM0OlodYwxjTl-elzh1cYJKgceeo/edit)** in Google Docs.

**Overview**
**TV text is unique in several ways.** Whether superimposed over other material (as a "super" or banner), or occupying the entire screen as a full-frame graphic, the words are:

-   **Temporary** (usually on the screen for just a few seconds); and
-   **Supplementary** (generally supporting images and audio, rather than serving as the primary source of information).

This means TV text should be:

> -   **Brief**  (There's only so much space on the screen.)
> -   **Clear**  (People don't have much time to scan the information.)
> -   **Synced**  (Words must match whatever else is being seen and/or heard, from locators to bullet-point graphics.)

But in other ways, TV text is not unique. **Like the rest of our journalism, it must also be:**

> -   **Accurate**  (Correct spellings, facts, figures, etc.)
> -   **Fair**  (Condensed without being misleading.)
> -   **Relevant**  (Help tell the story.)
> -   **Editorially consistent**  (Adhere to all CBC News guidelines, such as [anti-abortion](/home/a/abortion) instead of "pro-life" and [Myanmar](/home/m/Myanmar) instead of "Burma.")
> -   **Stylistically consistent**  (Follow in-house style, such as [SCC](/home/s#SupremeCourt) instead of "SCOC" and [half-mast](/home/h/half-mast) instead of "half-staff.")

The rest of this entry answers frequently asked questions about specific style points — from capitalizing descriptions in TV supers to spelling geographical locators.


**FAQs**

**U** 

**[u-um](/home/u#u)**

**[un-uz](/home/u#un)**

**u-um**
**UAP** (**unidentified anomalous phenomenon)**; **UAPs** (**unidentified anomalous phenomena**) The term UAP refers to any aerial sighting that cannot be immediately identified or explained. UAP has largely replaced the 1950s abbreviation **UFO** (**unidentified flying object)** in scientific circles, including at government agencies such as NASA. When UAP was coined in the 1960s it originally referred to "unidentified aerial phenomenon." The term remained relatively obscure until the early 2020s, when the adjective "anomalous" replaced "aerial." **Until UAP becomes commonplace, the recommended practice is to define the abbreviation in a brief, understandable way in given coverage** (e.g., "**UAPs, previously known as UFOs**"). NOTE: It's a convention to add an "s" to form the plural of UAP, even though the P stands for "phenomena," which is an irregular plural form from Greek and Latin. Experts point out that the label UFO remains commonly linked to science fiction tales of flying saucers and aliens visiting earth. By contrast, the name UAP is thought to better convey the sense of a broader range of mysterious sightings, including optical illusions caused by reflected light, which are not "flying objects" at all. Be aware that we're not obligated to use less-familiar terminology in our journalism solely because the language is in fashion within certain groups. This means that **the term UFOs may remain fine in certain headlines and TV banners.** At the same time, it's important to be accurate, especially when reporting proper nouns (e.g., in September 2023, NASA appointed a **director of UAP research**). Use your judgment based on a given story's facts.

**Uber** (company), **UberX** (app-based ride-booking service) The official name of the company is Uber (with a capital "U"), according to legal documents, even though it sometimes appears all lowercase or all uppercase in various forms of marketing. UberX was launched in 2012, and has expanded to various cities around the world. Proponents say ride-hailing services such as UberX can be cheaper and more convenient than using traditional cabs, while critics say they can be potentially risky since drivers do not need to have standard taxi licences. **UberX can often be shortened to Uber**, especially in second reference, as long as the story makes the context clear. But be aware that **the lowercase prefix "uber" is a generic term that means "extreme" or "ultimate."** When a company such as Uber also operates a taxi brokerage with officially licensed drivers, **use full names to distinguish between different services** (e.g., **UberTaxi** versus UberX). Avoid referring to UberX and similar services as taxis or as cabs. **Prefer the terms [ride-hailing](/home/r#ridehailing) or ride-booking**. Although the industry, itself, often markets these services as ridesharing, the word "sharing" can wrongly convey the sense of altruistic carpooling. By contrast, "ride-hailing" and "ride-booking" better describe the commercial transaction between driver and passenger.

**Ukraine, Ukrainian** (_never_ refer to it as "the" Ukraine) Ukraine's old, official name was the "Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic," which, in the West, was frequently shortened to "the Republic of Ukraine" or simply "the Ukraine." After the [Soviet Union](/home/s/soviet-union) began to collapse in the late 1980s, Ukraine held a sovereignty referendum. A majority of citizens voted for independence in 1991, and the country became officially known as Ukraine. Unlike many sovereign states, Ukraine has no formal (longer) alternative name, which makes use of "the" always wrong. See [country names](/home/g/geography-cities) for details and other examples, as well as [Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names) for guidelines on preferred transliterations Kyiv and Chornobyl. See also [Donbas](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/donbas_donetsk_luhansk/ "Donbas_Donetsk_Luhansk") (Donetsk, Luhansk) as well as [Crimea](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/crimea/ "Crimea") for handling language over disputed territory, and our [military overview](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-terms-overview/#war "Military terms overview") for wording of stories about Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

**Ukrainian Christmas** (_generally avoid outside of attribution_; prefer generic phrasing such as **Orthodox Christmas** instead) The once-entrenched compound **"Ukrainian Christmas" is now considered outmoded and inaccurate** for a couple of reasons. First, members of certain Eastern Orthodox churches in various countries celebrate Christmas in January (according to the Julian calendar), rater than in December (according to the Gregorian calendar), including congregants in Russia, Greece, Romania, Serbia and parts of the Middle East. So calling Jan. 7th "Ukrainian" Christmas is viewed as narrowly misleading. Second, a few years after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, political leaders in Kyiv encouraged Ukrainians to switch to December 25th Christmas celebrations to distance the country from the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. See also [holidays and other special times](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/h/holidays/ "Holidays") for general capitalization guidelines.

**under as an adverb**
Sometimes "under" is fused as an adjective (**underwater**), as in "an _underwater creature_," but detached as an adverb (**under water**), as in "_They were swimming under water when they discovered the treasure._" Often, however, the adverb is one word too (e.g., **underground, underhand** and **underneath**), as in "_The mouse was underneath the sofa._" Note: Treat **underway** as a one-word adverb, as in "_Contract talks got underway at dawn Monday._" Although the Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage says a two-word adverbial form is equally common, we follow CP's preference and use the fused version in this case.

**Unifor** (OK in all references. Does _not_ need to be spelled out as "Union for Canada.") Formed in 2013 when the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) merged. NOTE: In historical references to CAW and CEP, there are no [possessive apostrophes](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe#workers) when those nouns are spelled out. As well, the generic term autoworker is fused, even though the old union's name included a space between this compound (Canadian Auto Workers).

**uninterested** (not interested); **disinterested** (impartial)

**union** (lowercase in all generic references) For example, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is commonly known as the **Teamsters union**. But capitalize when reporting full proper nouns (e.g., the **Canadian Union of Public Employees**). Be aware that the term "union" is conventionally used to mean any group involved in collective bargaining for specific workers, including various professional associations, such as a teachers' federation.

**union boss, union bosses** (_**caution**_) Generally avoid, especially in coverage of contract negotiations. These terms lack neutrality (i.e., we normally don't say "corporate bosses") and precision. They're also perceived as pejorative by some, conveying a link to "mob bosses" or conjuring up negative images of those in the labour movement as bullies or thugs. Alternatives include "**union leader**(s)" and "**union head**(s)." The same caveat about "union boss" applies to all "labour-related" language (e.g., prefer **labour council head, labour leader**). Whenever possible, be more precise by specifying a title (e.g., **union president**, **union director**), including whether the person's position is at the national, regional or local level. See also [strike versus lockout](/home/s#strike), and why we use contract dispute instead of [labour dispute](/home/l#labourdispute).

Unless regional context is already clear, it's helpful to modify the proper noun with the province's name in first reference (e.g., **Alberta's United Conservative Party, Alberta UCP** members).

**Uyghurs** (for consistency use this spelling, which has gradually replaced the centuries-old "Uig-" version listed in the Canadian Oxford) This "y" form is preferred by English-speaking Uyghurs, and matches the names of organizations like the **World Uyghur Congress**. It's also the transliteration commonly used by Ottawa and a number of other governments around the world. This includes English documents published by Chinese authorities. Uyghurs are members of an ethnic group from Central Asia. Most now live in [Xinjiang](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/x/#Xinjiang "X"), a vast area of western China that borders Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and several other countries. They're Turkic-speaking Muslims who accuse China of religious and political persecution. Beijing, in turn, says Uyghur dissidents are leading an Islamic separatist movement. To give readers context, Uyghurs are often briefly defined in stories as **Chinese Muslims**. Outside of proper nouns, avoid other [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), including "Uyhur" and "Uighur."

### Ukrainian names

**Ukrainian names**

**Although many languages use variations of the Cyrillic alphabet, each is slightly different.** In the case of Ukrainian and Russian, for example, a few characters appear in one alphabet but not in the other, while several identical characters are pronounced in separate ways.

Some parts of Ukraine are predominately Russian-speaking, especially in eastern areas. But **the country's official language is Ukrainian**, which uses **a modified Cyrillic alphabet** with **33 letters** that represent 38 distinct phonemic sounds. As noted below: **The romanization of a lot of Ukrainian geographical names has changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s**, and Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991 (e.g., the shift from the Russian-based "ie" to the Ukrainian-based "yi" transliteration of the capital city: **Kyiv**).



**PEOPLE**
Be aware that the **English spellings of people's names in countries like Ukraine can vary widely** for several reasons:


> **(i) Pronunciation decisions**, including regional differences/preferences.
> **(ii) Transliteration choices** when contrasting conventions may apply.
> **(iii) The whims of bureaucrats registering names**, such as passport office clerks.


**In general, adhere to the individual's known preference** unless there's a strong editorial reason to diverge — for example, when a different English spelling is deeply entrenched (e.g., in the case of a public figure), or when truly bizarre typography might needlessly confuse our audience (e.g., fusing [non-English characters](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/f/foreign-words/#roman_alphabet "Foreign words") and diacritical markings into the Latin alphabet).

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** illustrates this principle. After he was elected Ukraine's president in April 2019, media in the West reported inconsistent spellings, including **Zelenskiy, Zelenskyi, Zelenskyy** and **Zelensky**. As a political candidate the previous few months, he'd actually used "Zelenskiy," himself, on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. After winning the election, however, he switched to Zelenskyy on social media. A few months later, Ukraine's largest, oldest English newspaper, [the Kyiv Post, said the move away from "Zelenskiy" was understandable](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/jebb0qrh/zelensky_y-so-many-ys_kyiv-post-editorial_june-14-2019.pdf "Zelensky Y So Many Ys KYIV POST Editorial June 14 2019 (1)") because it was viewed by many as an old, Russian-based transliteration. At the same time, its editorial board considered the "yy" choice odd and inelegant. The president's aides, meanwhile, confirmed that the English name on his passport was "Volodymyr Zelenskyy," but also said that this spelling was based on a decision by the passport office, itself, and that [the newly elected president did not object to alternative versions](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/media/wo1hhoro/zelenskyy_spelling_tweet_june-2019.jpg "Zelenskyy Spelling Tweet June 2019") in English. As a result, CBC News and many other major western media initially went with the shortened form, Zelensky, including AP, the BBC and the New York Times. So did the Kyiv Post. During the next two years, however, "Zelenskyy" appeared consistently in official Ukrainian documents translated into English. Then Western governments and various international organizations, such as NATO, adopted the "yy" version of the president's name. The Associated Press officially switched to Zelenskyy in the spring of 2022. But some English news organizations in Europe and North America stuck with the single "y" spelling, which left more than a few people in our audience confused. **In July 2022, we reviewed the transliteration debate and agreed with AP that it made sense to identify the man by his unambiguously stated preference, Volodymyr Zelenskyy**, because there was no compelling editorial reason to diverge from what had become an entrenched English spelling.


**GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS**
Inconsistent spellings of people's names should not be confused with the politics of other proper nouns, including geographical names. **Since the breakup of the old Soviet Union, transliterations of cities and towns based on Russian have been revised in many former republics** to reflect the official language of each new, independent country. **In Ukraine, this means:**

>      **Kyiv** (capital city; _not "Kiev"_)
>
>   The [preferred CBC pronunciation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2Fapps%2Flng%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D37206&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2fgVb8rmHYPFggv1qX3W5G) is "**KEE-ef**."
>
>
> **Chornobyl** (_not "Chernobyl"_)
>
> **Donetsk** (_not "Doneck" or "Stalino"_)
>
> **Kharkiv** (_not "Kharkov"_)
>
> **Luhansk** (_not "Lugansk"_)
>
> **Lviv** (_not "Lvov"_)
>
> **Odesa** (_not "Odessa"_)
>
> **Slovyansk** (_not "Sloviansk"_)
>
> **Zakarpattia** (_not "Zacarpatia"_)


**PRONUNCIATION PHILOSOPHY:** We aim for **a consistent, respectful pronunciation** that acknowledges the country's preferred phonetics (i.e., Ukrainian rather than Russian) **without expecting CBC journalists to speak Ukrainian in our English news and current affairs programming**. See the March 2022 [**pronunciation of Ukrainian names**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2022/2022-03-01/ "2022 03 01") memo for details.


**Ukraine formally adopted the new English spellings after declaring independence in the 1990s**, and requested that other governments follow suit. A 2011 document entitled the [Romanization System in Ukraine](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/26th-gegn-docs/WP/WP21_Roma_system_Ukraine%20_engl._.pdf) submitted to the United Nations is representative. Over time, these Ukrainian transliterations have been embraced by foreign affairs departments in Ottawa, Washington and elsewhere, as well as by the UN.

**CBC News prefers the revised spellings for two reasons:**



1.  **Accuracy.** The Ukrainian transliterations more closely reflect the official names. 
2.  **Respect for a known local preference.** [Ukraine's request for specific transliterations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kyivpost.com%2Fukraine-politics%2Fkyivnotkiev-campaign-asks-foreign-media-to-change-their-spelling-of-ukraines-capital.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0fdAireLldNaiNPZskLwXP) is compelling, given the now-sovereign country's efforts to rid itself of Russian influence over its language and culture.

**In the case of rivers and mountain ranges that cross several countries, generally prefer conventional spellings that are widely known** (e.g., the **Danube River** instead of the "Dunai River"). **Otherwise, adopt romanized spellings that match related Ukrainian names** (e.g., the **Dnipro River** rather than the "Dnieper River," since the **Dnipropetrovsk** oblast is commonly shortened to **Dnipro**). NOTE: It can be challenging to cover a region where old and new transliterations sometimes still coexist in official arenas (e.g., the "Dnipro River" and the "Dnieper River" both appeared Ukrainian government documents in 2022). Consistency and audience familiarity should always be considered major factors when weighing options. 


IMPORTANT: Avoid adding the definite article "[the](/home/t/the-versus-the#geographical)" in front of the country's name. It's Ukraine, NEVER "the Ukraine." The sovereign country has no alternative, formal name featuring a noun like "republic" or "kingdom" — unlike, say, the People's Republic of China or the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.


**Slow transition toward new geographical transliterations**
**Decades after Ukraine declared independence, a mix of inconsistent Ukrainian spellings remained common in English news coverage** — including in stories by prominent media organizations that refer to, say, Ukrainian-based _Kyiv_ in one paragraph but to Russian-based _Chernobyl_ in the other. This incongruity continued after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

**However, a primary source of CBC wire copy, The Canadian Press, adopted Ukrainian transliterations** (Kyiv, Chornobyl, Odesa, and so forth) **at roughly the same time we did. This is good news from a practical standpoint, since a lot of the wire material we get** (even from AP) **goes through CP first.** In other words, Ukrainian transliterations in CP and AP stories generally match CBC style.

NOTE: **Our main source for the spellings of communities outside of Canada remains the National Geographic Atlas of the World.** But there are exceptions (e.g., Kabul not "Kabol," Damascus not "Dimashq," and Rome not "Roma"). So **always check the CBC Language Guide first**. It's impossible for this site to list all foreign geographical names. **When spellings of Ukrainian cities, towns, villages, etc., are in doubt,** good external sources include the United Nations, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, and the Canadian Embassy in Ukraine. **A fast and valuable source is the [Kyiv Post newspaper](https://www.kyivpost.com/)**. For instance, a quick keyword search for "Borodyanka" confirms that local Ukrainian journalists prefer a "y" instead of an "i" in their English coverage of the small community near Kyiv. 


**What about 'chicken Kiev'?**
Keep in mind that the preferred transliterations above refer to proper geographical names. Other entrenched usage, such as a recipe for **chicken Kiev**, continues to be spelled the old way. This matches our approach to, say, a dish of **Peking duck** — even though the old name Peking was switched to Beijing back in the 1980s, based on China's preference for the Pinyin spelling system.

### United Arab Emirates


**United Arab Emirates**

**The United Arab Emirates is a country along the southern base of the Persian Gulf.** It was founded in the early 1970s when seven oil-rich states formed a federation.

Spell out the noun in first reference: **United Arab Emirates**. This can be shortened to **the Emirates** after that. The abbreviation **U.A.E.** is fine in headlines, graphics and alternative second references. Periods are included because it's a [geographical abbreviation](/home/a/abbreviations#uppercase).

Although the seven members have their own monarchs, they are not considered separate countries. Rather, they should be described as states or emirates within the U.A.E. **The emirates are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain.**

**Rulers are sheiks not emirs**
Traditionally, the term emirate refers to a region controlled by an emir. **But the ruler of each U.A.E. member uses the title sheik rather than emir.** These monarchs govern the United Arab Emirates. They sit on the **Supreme Council**, which formulates federal policies, approves national laws, ratifies treaties, etc.


**Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi City**
The name Abu Dhabi sometimes causes confusion. It refers to one of the emirates as well as to the country's capital (**Abu Dhabi City**). While context normally provides sufficient detail, include the word "City" in first reference (along the lines of [New York City](/home/n#NewYork)) to ensure there's no ambiguity. In web headlines where space is limited, Abu Dhabi alone is OK. **But be sure to include the word "City" in first reference to U.A.E.'s capital in the main body of the story.**

**United Arab Emirates is a singular noun**
Some style manuals suggest treating U.A.E. as a plural rather than as a collective singular because it's made up of seven emirates. But since it's a country, the conventional approach is to consider it singular along the lines of the United States (e.g., the United Arab Emirates "is" not "are"), unless the short form the Emirates is used (e.g., the Emirates "have" always not "has" always).

### United Kingdom

**United Kingdom**

The actual name is "the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland," but it does not need to be spelled out in full in news stories. United Kingdom is sufficient.



**What's included**
The **United Kingdom** consists of **England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland**. The population is roughly twice the size of Canada's.

The noun **Britain** technically refers to **one island: England, Scotland and Wales**. (It used to be called Great Britain to distinguish it from Brittany.) "Britain" and "British" are conventionally used as synonyms for the United Kingdom, except in stories involving Northern Ireland.

The initials U.K. are fine in headlines when applicable, but **in many routine stories "British" is the preferred adjective** (e.g., the "British government" rather than the "U.K. government"), unless coverage is focused on Northern Ireland.


**What's excluded**
**U.K. does not include the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea.** These three islands are classified as _Crown dependencies_, which means they're independently administered jurisdictions separate from (but owned by) the United Kingdom. This can have ramifications for everything from news coverage of taxation rates to reports on immigration and health care.

Although Crown dependencies have their own governments, they're not separate countries, and some legislation they pass still requires approval by the Privy Council in London. It's common and acceptable to refer to the Isle of Man, the Channel Island of Jersey and the Channel Island of Guernsey, without using jargon such as "British Crown dependencies." Just make sure we **don't imply that they're part of the U.K.** Technically, they're part of the **British Islands** (which is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man).

In addition to excluding nearby Crown dependencies, **the United Kingdom does not include more than a dozen British "overseas territories"** (sometimes called "dependent territories"), such as Gibraltar, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands and Montserrat.


**Why U.K. 'devolution' requires special care**
**The United Kingdom is no longer a unitary state with a single parliament** at Westminster. The specifics are complicated and evolving. After centuries of a relatively straightforward structure, **government authority is now less centralized**. This means it's **inaccurate to use U.K. as a default noun or modifier across the board** when we're reporting on various regional or "subnational" powers and policies.

**The transfer of certain authority** to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland since the late 1990s **is known as "devolution."** The **U.K. government in London remains responsible for national policy in areas that have not been "devolved" — known as "reserved powers."** This includes **defence, national security, foreign affairs, immigration, citizenship, etc.**, but NOT agriculture, education, housing and health care.

One wrinkle: **There is no regional legislative body in England comparable to** those now sitting in Wales (the Welsh Assembly at **Cardiff Bay**), in Scotland (the Scottish Parliament at **Edinburgh**) and in Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Assembly at **Belfast**). Instead, the U.K. Parliament in London remains responsible for any devolved authority in England.

Another wrinkle is that **some "reserved powers" have not been formally tested in courts**, This means, for example, that during a global health emergency, it's possible that the U.K. government could try to impose specific policies on all subnational jurisdictions in the name of public safety. Instead, however, there's generally been a more collaborative, patchwork approach to such crises, first during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic and then again during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

**KEY TAKEAWAY: U.K often remains the right choice** in news stories. **But be aware that a headline or TV banner that at one time would have automatically featured "U.K." might now need to be changed to "England" or "Scotland" or whatever proper noun applies.** For instance, during coverage of a deadly virus outbreak, we might need to refer to an easing of "England lockdown" restrictions (for policies outlined by the PM in London), or of "Scotland lockdown" restrictions (for policies outlined by Scottish parliamentary leaders), etc., rather than to an easing of "U.K. lockdown" restrictions, especially since the details may vary from region to region.


**TIP: If you're unsure whether "U.K." applies, it can be helpful to scan coverage from the BBC**, where journalists routinely deal with the complexities of devolved powers in their country.

### United Nations

**United Nations (UN)**

**The United Nations should be spelled out in first reference, although UN is fine in headlines:**


> UN General Assembly, the General Assembly, the Assembly
> UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the secretary general (See also [\-general](/home/g/generalsuffix))
> UN Security Council, the Security Council


Be aware that a few news organizations add periods to UN because they treat it as a geographical location, along the lines of B.C., rather than as a name. But **CBC News style is UN without punctuation.**

**UN organizations**
Some UN bodies are frequently referred to in stories. There's no need to add "UN" unless it's part of the proper name:


> **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations** (_Avoid_ abbreviation FAO. Prefer "the organization" on second reference.)
>
> **IMF** (_Use_ **International Monetary Fund** _on first reference_. Initials IMF fine in headlines.)
>
> **International Civil Aviation Organization** (**ICAO** or the organization on second reference.)
>
> **International Court of Justice** (No abbreviation.)
>
> **International Labour Organization** (**ILO** or the organization on second reference.)
>
> **UNICEF** (Fine in first reference, but define as the _"United Nations Children's Fund" at some point in story_.) It's no longer called "the UN International Children's Emergency Fund," even though the old abbreviation is still used.
>
> **UN High Commissioner for Refugees**
>
> **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization** (**UNESCO** fine in second reference.)
>
> **World Bank** (Acceptable in all references to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. _There's no need to use the longer title_.)
>
> **World Food Program** (preferred North American spelling, rather than _Programme_, based on the entrenched convention of adopting more familiar spellings of certain words — even when these are technically proper noun components of international organizations' English names.)
>
> **World Health Organization** (**WHO** OK in headlines and second reference) There's usually no need to use a definite article before the abbreviation — i.e., make it "according to WHO" rather than "according to the WHO" — based on convention. Be aware, however, that WHO on its own can sometimes sound more like a pronoun ("who") than an abbreviation in broadcast scripts. Adding "the" in those cases is fine. Using a synonym like "the organization" or "the UN body" is another effective option. See [acronyms](/home/a/acronyms) for other examples of dropped articles.

### United States

**United States, U.S., US**
[General](/home/u/united-states#general) (include periods unless referring to currency; add U.S. to otherwise ambiguous names, titles)
[State abbreviations](/home/u/united-states#states) (Ala., Calif., Ky., N.Y., Pa., S.D., Vt., W.Va., Wyo.)
[Standalone cities](/home/u/united-states#cities) (state detail not required when cities well known)


**General**
Prefer **United States** or **the U.S.** rather than _United States of America_ or the _U.S.A._

**U.S.** has periods **except in currency ($300 US)** See [money](/home/m/money)

**"American" is fine as an adjective** describing people and things in general (an **American city**, an **American scientist**), but try to use U.S. for more formal references to the country or its government (e.g., **U.S. Embassy** or **U.S. trade representative**).

**Ordinarily avoid "America" as a synonym for the country**, itself, outside of verbatim quotes **for two reasons:**


> **1\. Accuracy. The U.S. is only one part of the Americas** — which technically refers to the entire Western Hemisphere, including the Caribbean and West Indies. As a plural collective, "the Americas" is suitable for stories about both continents (North and South America).
>
> **2\. Entrenched Canadian convention.** As the Oxford Guide to Canadian English points out: "Canadians seldom refer to the United States as 'America,' although this usage is common around the world. Canadians say 'the United States' or, informally, 'the States.'" For large segments of our audience, therefore, constantly referring to the U.S. as "America" is like dropping the "u" from "honour."


**Occasional exceptions are fine when there's a compelling editorial reason**, especially in stories about trade, politics, world affairs, etc., that feature established phrases, such as "**America First**" or "**Death to America**" or "**Make America Great Again**." This headline from 2020 is OK, for example, because its colloquial use of "America" adds acceptable colour, and because repeating "U.S." would unnecessarily spoil the conversational phrasing:


> _First **U.S.** presidential debate 'not a very good night' for **America**_


The same approach is sometimes taken in TV banners or graphics (e.g., "America Votes" rather than "The U.S. Votes").

See **[Avoid inapt Americanisms](/home/a/americanisms)** for an overview of Canadian versus American English (e.g., avoid _DUI, half-staff, railroad_)

**Add U.S. to the names of most government departments, agencies and other organizations in first reference** to make stories clearer (e.g., the U.S. State Department) unless the proper noun is instantly recognized (e.g., NASA, NSA, FBI, CIA). **Even when popular short forms are spelled out, our default practice is to add U.S.** (e.g., the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. National Security Agency, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency). NOTE: The [official names of hundreds of U.S. government departments and agencies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.gov%2Ffederal-agencies%2Fa&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0_x97cYtsF4H9CmLuUigO9) are listed in alphabetical order on USA.gov. 

**Words such as "national" and "federal" require particular care** because American media reports frequently leave out a key geographical modifier (U.S.) because the detail is assumed. **To avoid ambiguity, we need to specify what's not Canadian** (e.g., the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.S. National Security Agency, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration). **When Canadian and U.S. agencies have similar names, take special care** to avoid misidentifying either:


> _Transportation Safety Board of Canada_
>
> _U.S. National Transportation Safety Board_


For example, it can be confusing and potentially misleading to call Canada's Transportation Safety Board the "national" Transportation Safety Board even in the context of a Canadian story. In broadcast scripts, the lowercase "national" is heard by some of our audience as a capitalized "National" — i.e., as the official U.S. name being misapplied to a Canadian agency.

**Add U.S. to the titles of most federal politicians in first reference:
**

> _U.S. President Donald Trump says ..._


**In second reference, the name or abbreviated title alone is sufficient.** Options include:


> _President Trump tweeted ..._
>
> _Trump tweeted ..._
>
> _The president tweeted ..._


Remember that the world has many presidents. **Avoid mirroring the style of American news organizations, such as AP, which tend to drop U.S.** from the title because it's implied. For the same reason U.S. journalists invariably identify foreign political figures with geographical modifiers (e.g., "Canadian" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau), it's CBC News style to add locators to the titles of foreign leaders, regardless of their profiles.

See [**titles**](/home/t/titles) for related guidelines (e.g., add "former" to titles of past U.S. presidents). See also [**TV text**](/home/t/tv_text) for specific television guidelines. (While most people are identified in supers at least once in TV stories, current U.S. presidents are among the rare exceptions.)

**New England** is made up of six states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.

**Do not abbreviate** the following U.S. states or associated territories: **Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas, Utah, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands**.

Follow the standard rule for shortened forms, which are not used except in headlines and after the names of most communities:

> _She moved to Great Falls, Mont., in 1944._


See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities#maps-graphics) for details on why **two-character postal abbreviations like AB for Alabama and MA for** **Massachusetts** **are restricted to maps, graphics, etc.**, where space constraints are typically severe.


**A few dozen well-known U.S. cities can stand alone on first reference**:

> _They flew to Detroit on Saturday._



**U.S. cities that can stand alone as locators**
**Do not put geographical abbreviations** (state or district) **after the communities listed below:**


> **Atlanta**
>
> **Baltimore**
>
> **Boston**

> **St. Louis**
>
> **Salt Lake City**
>
> **San Diego**
>
> **San Francisco**
>
> **Washington**
>
> **Seattle**


The noun **Washington** normally implies Washington, D.C. Therefore, it's generally unnecessary to add "D.C." as long as the story makes this context clear. See [Washington](/home/w#Washington) for details and examples, including how to handle the compound **Washington state**.

See [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for detailed guidelines on commas, etc.

### Universities and colleges

**Universities and colleges**

**Capitalize the names of universities and colleges:**

Carleton University
Dalhousie University
McMaster University
Memorial University of Newfoundland (also known as Memorial University)
Nunavut Arctic College
Red Deer College
Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University)
University of British Columbia
University of Manitoba
University of Toronto

**Abbreviations are OK, especially in second reference, as long as they're entrenched:**

BYU
MUN (or just Memorial)
UBC
UCLA
U of A
U of T

**Often a principal word is sufficient in second reference.** The initial "U" is generally unnecessary when the word "university" falls at the end of the proper noun unless the school's name has recently changed and we want to emphasize its new status to keep the story clear:

Carleton
Dalhousie
McMaster
[OCADU](/home/o#OCADU) (or OCAD alone in second reference if new university status is already obvious in story)

**Keep departments, schools, programs, courses, etc. lowercase:
**
the Queen’s University medical school
the biology department
a political science professor
the faculty of arts
a chemistry course
an English class

**Use the abbreviation Prof.** for professor **before names. Reserve “Dr.” for people with medical degrees:**

Prof. Kriss Kringle …
Kriss Kringle, an economics professor at Laval University
Kringle, who teaches business ethics …

See also [degrees](/home/d/degrees) (B.Sc. but BA)

The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada lists virtually all degree-granting, post-secondary institutions in the country. The [AUCC directory](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.univcan.ca%2Funiversities%2Fmember-universities%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0zbLvqsj-tTSupIUcw8jiS) includes brief background about each university and college, as well as links to every school's website.

### URLs

**URL**

**This computer term** (often pronounced "Earl") stands for **uniform resource locator** (although some people use "_universal_" and "_uniform_" interchangeably, including a few programmers writing explanatory notes at the World Wide Web Consortium).
**
URL refers to the address used to find a "resource" on the internet** (**normally a web page**, although it could also locate CGI and Java programs as well as graphic files).

**In news stories, use the term "web address" instead of URL.** Avoid other jargon tied to these addresses as well (e.g., pointer or protocol) unless it’s explained.


**Dot and slash dissection**
**URLs are broken down into four main components. Each part helps a computer locate files.** For instance: _http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp\_murray/20021021.html_

**1.** _http://_ stands for _hypertext transfer protocol_. It’s the most common protocol in URLs, although others exist (including _ftp://_, which stands for file transfer protocol).

**2.** _www_ is a pointer attached to the _domain name_. It’s the most common pointer.

**3\.** _cbc.ca_ is the _main domain name_.

**4.** The last part (_/news/viewpoint/vp\_murrary/20021021.html_) is a _pointer_ that directs the computer to _a specific file on the server_ (in this case, a column by CBC News foreign correspondent Don Murray).


**Slash (/), not backslash (\\)**
**When reading internet addresses on air, use the term "slash"** rather than "backslash." **A slash** (/) **is a forward-sloping diagonal line**, also known as a solidus, that appears in a lot of URLs.
**
There's no need to say "forward" slash on air.** The left-to-right lean is implied.

The backslash (\\) is relatively rare punctuation, known as a reverse solidus. It's used in some computer programming languages.


**Text instead of hypertext**
On CBCNews.ca, we normally add actual links with HTML code instead of writing out web addresses as part of a story's main text. **In rare cases when the URL is written out, don’t bother including http:// because it’s implied** (www.cbc.ca, not http://www.cbc.ca). **If another protocol is used, however, specify which one** (e.g., ftp).

**Generally drop www from the URLs of well-known websites** (e.g., cbc.ca rather than www.cbc.ca), **and leave out the last slash** (e.g., news.bbc.co.uk rather than news.bbc.co.uk/).

Also, **generally match the pathway’s lowercase lettering** (e.g., "The Great Canadian Wish List's web address contained a four-letter word that was easy to remember: cbc.ca/wish"). **This represents an exception to our normal approach to domain names , which are usually treated as proper nouns featuring capital letters** (e.g., CBC.ca, and [CBCNews.ca](/home/c/cbc)).


**An or a URL?**
Is it "_an URL_" or "_a URL_"? The answer _depends entirely on pronunciation_. If you say the letters individually (i.e., "_you-are-ell_") the abbreviation requires an "a" before it. But if you treat the cluster as an acronym (pronounced "_Earl_") then the word "an" is needed.

**V** 

**[v-vh](/home/v#v)**

**[vi-vy](/home/v#vi)**

**v-vh**
**V-6, V-8** (engines) See [numbers](/home/n/numbers)

**V-chip** (television)

**VCR, VCRs** (acceptable in all references to **videocassette recorders**)

**VE-Day** (May 8, 1945), **VJ-Day** (Aug. 14, 1945) These abbreviations refer to the official dates during the final year of the Second World War when the Allied forces declared "Victory in Europe" (VE) and "Victory over Japan" (VJ). The latter date is sometimes reported as Aug. 15 because of time zone differences between North America and Asia (i.e., the announcement was made at 7 p.m. ET by U.S. President Harry Truman). But for consistency, Aug. 14 is the preferred date. Use uppercase letters, no periods and a hyphen, as in D-Day.

**Villepin, Dominique de** (former French prime minister) Use **Villepin** alone in second reference. For general guidelines on de, du, van, von, etc., see [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von).

**VIP** (no need to spell out "very important person"), **VIPs** (no [apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes) in plural)

**VJ** (_not_ veejay), **VJs**

**VLT** (**video lottery terminal**) Is everyone across the country familiar with this gambling equipment? The odds are about as poor as this pun. _Spell out the abbreviation at some point in the story_. The plural is VLTs.

**V-neck** (clothing)

**vaccine hesitancy** (non-ideological concern about specific treatment); **anti-vaccination** (general, ideological opposition to vaccines) See [anti-vaccination, anti-vaxx, anti-vaxxer](/home/a/anti-vaccination) for details

**[vaccine passport](/home/p#passports)** (OK as colloquial term for proof-of-vaccination certificate)

**vaccination** (See [immunization, inoculation, vaccination](/home/i/immunization-vaccination))

**vacillate vacuum, vacuums** (not vacua) See also [Latin plurals](/home/l/latin-plurals)

**Vaisakhi** (annual April event celebrated by Sikhs and Hindus) For Hindus, it represents the start of the traditional solar new year. For Sikhs, it marks not only the new year but also the formal establishment of their faith — making it one of the most significant dates on their calendar. Vaisakhi is also an ancient spring harvest festival in parts of India. Use this entrenched spelling. Avoid other [transliterations](/home/t/transliterations), such as "Baisakhi" and "Vasakhi."

**valentine** (card, gift, etc.), _but_ **Valentine's Day** (See [holidays and other special times](/home/h/holidays))

**Valium** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a tranquillizer)

**valley** except in proper names (**Okanagan Valley**, etc.) See [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization)

**valour** _but_ **valorous** (See [our and or](/home/s/spelling/our))

**Van**, [**Von**](/home/v#Von) (When lowercase in names, such as **Vincent van Gogh**, capitalize these particles only at the start of sentences or headlines: "Van Gogh painted …" but "It's a van Gogh painting.") Be aware of a person's preference as well as established convention. In some cases, van is dropped in second reference (e.g., **Ludwig van Beethoven** becomes Beethoven). In other cases, Van is always uppercase in the full name and may be dropped altogether in subsequent references. (See [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for more details on da, de, du, van, von, etc.)

**Vance, JD** (no periods)

**Van Doos** (This is an English version of the French word for 22nd, _vingt-deuxième_. It's an acceptable nickname for Quebec's Royal 22nd Regiment, in headlines and second reference); Van Doo (one member), **the Van Doos** (plural for all or some of the regiment); Use the English form of the full proper noun ("Royal 22nd Regiment") rather than the French ("Royal 22e Régiment"). Options for shortened second references include the 22nd Regiment, the 22nd and the regiment. Although Royal 22nd Regiment is also officially known by its French name (akin to Montreal and Montréal being equally correct in the eyes of federal officials), CBC News adopts entrenched English equivalents. So just as we write "4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry" our Radio-Canada colleagues use "4e Bataillon" rather than the English form. See [French words](/home/f/french-words-and-accents) as well as [military forces](/home/m/military-forces) for general guidelines.

**VANOC** (OK in headlines and second reference) In most stories, there is no need to spell out the full proper noun: the "Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games." Instead, simply make clear we're referring to organizers of the Vancouver Olympics (e.g., "the 2010 Olympic organizing committee, **known as VANOC"**). Avoid the phrase "known as VANOC" in leads, but try to insert it within the first three to four paragraphs if the abbreviation appears in the headline. Second-reference options include the **committee**, the **organizing committee** and VANOC. (See also [Olympics](/home/o/olympic-games) for general style guidelines)

**vape, vaping, vape shop, vape pen** (see [e-cigarettes](/home/e#e-cigarette))

**vapour, vapourish** _but_ **vaporous** and **vaporize** (See [our and or](/home/s/spelling/our))

**Vaseline** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a petroleum jelly)

**Vatican II, Second Vatican Council vaudeville Veda** (the main scripture of Hinduism, believed to have been written about 3,500 years ago)

**[VE-Day](/home/v#VEDay)**

**Velcro** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a type of fastener)

**venetian blind** (lowercase)

**Venice** (not "Venezia," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**veranda** (_not_ -ah)

**verbal** (communication through words, either written or spoken) _Do not confuse with oral, which refers to spoken words only_.

**verbatim** (_not_ -um)

**verdict** (Conventionally applied to a jury's decision. When referring to the findings of judges, prefer _ruling_, _decision_, etc.). See also [Canadian court terms](/home/c/canadian-court-terms)

**Vermont (Vt.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**versus** (generally spell out the word) Reserve **"vs."** for the names of most court cases (**R. vs. Morgentaler**), headlines, and sports summaries. Use the alternative "v." only when entrenched by convention (e.g., in U.S. court cases, such as **Roe v. Wade**). In broadcast reports, "vs." is usually pronounced "versus" while "v." is traditionally pronounced "vee."

**vertebra, vertebrae** (plural)

**veteran, vet** (military service) The generic term "veteran" is commonly used to suggest lengthy experience in many fields (a veteran broadcaster, a veteran police officer). But it has a narrower meaning in the military, where the term conventionally means the person has served in a combat zone (i.e., the word "war" is implied, as in "war veteran").

**Veterans Affairs Canada** (no apostrophe); **Veterans Affairs** often fine in first reference (Veterans Affairs Minister George Harris Hees); also known as the **Department of Veterans Affairs**

**Veterans Charter** (frequently called the new **Veterans Charter**) It does not need to be spelled out in stories as **the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-Establishment and Compensation Act** (the proper name of the legislation). The charter was proclaimed in 2006. It was the first major overhaul of veterans' benefits since the 1970s. There is no [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe) in Veterans Charter. (See also [Charter versus charter)](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/c/#Charter "C")

**veterans ombudsman** (no apostrophe) This is the official title, not "veterans affairs" ombudsman. The position was created in 2007 under the new Veterans Charter.

**veterinarian**

**[v-vh](/home/v#v) - [vi-vy](/home/v#vi) - [bottom](/home/v#bottom)**
**vi-vy**

**Viagra** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a drug to treat impotence)

**via** (use it to refer to the path taken, not to the means of transportation) "They went to Seattle via Vancouver" but "They went to Seattle by bus" _not "via a bus."_

**Via Rail** (_not_ VIA); Via is fine in second reference (See also [railway versus railroad](/home/r/railway-versus-railroad) and [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization))

**vice** (bad habit, illegal activity); **vise** (clamp); **vice-** (second in chain of authority)

**vice-admiral** (no abbreviation) See [military ranks](/home/m/military-ranks)

**Vice-President** versus **vice-president** (See [titles](/home/t/titles))

**viceregal** (one word) See also [Governor General](/home/g/governor-general) for details about this national viceregal post

**vice versa** (two words)

**vichyssoise** (Don't refer to this as a French dish. It's a hot or cold leek-and-potato soup that was created by a chef at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York. It's named after his hometown of Vichy.)

**vicious**

**Victoria Cross (VC)**

**video, videocassette, videotape, video game, video game console, videocassette recorder (VCR)** It's unnecessary (but not wrong) to spell out the abbreviation at some point in the story. The plural is **VCRs**.

**vie**, but **vying**

**Vienna** (not "Wien," as listed in the [National Geographic Atlas](/home/s/spelling#geographicalnames))

**Vietnam, Vietnamese** (See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) for general guidelines on capitalization, etc.)

**Vietnam War** (see also [War versus war](/home/w/war))

**vigour, vigorous**

**vilify, vilified, vilification**

**village** (general and geographical references), as "in the village of Malpeque Bay, P.E.I.," but **Village** for corporate references (i.e., using a community's formal, legal name), as in "He sued the travel agency and the Village of Malpeque Bay." See also [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) for general guidelines on identifying communities in Canada.

**VIP** (fine in first reference; no need to spell out as "very important person"); the plural is **VIPs**

**viral, to go viral, gone viral** (social media, especially internet videos and tweets) Viral in this context normally means to spread rapidly and widely by people sharing something of interest. While there's no specific threshold (e.g., one million views within 12 hours), we should reserve the term for content that's unusually popular and creating a conversational buzz. Otherwise, trendy material is simply getting noticed, gaining attention, becoming popular, etc. Old content can go viral months or years after being originally posted, once it's discovered and begins spreading quickly and widely.

**Virginia (Va.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**Virgin Islands** (no abbreviation)

**virtuoso, virtuosos**

**Visa** (credit card)

**vis-a-vis**

**vise** (clamp); **vice** (bad habit, illegal activity); **vice-** (second in chain of authority)

**viscous** (sticky or not flowing freely); **vicious** (mean or intense)

[**visible minority**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/r/racial-terms/#visible-minority "Racial terms") (avoid unless attributed)

**VisionTV** (specialty channel's name is fused) See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for relevant guidelines

**visually impaired** (avoid; use [**partly blind**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/d/disability-language/#blind "Disability language"))

**vitamin A, vitamin B**, etc.

**VJ** (not veejay), **VJs**

**[VJ-Day](/home/v#VEDay)**

**voice mail** (two words)

**voice-over-internet protocol** (two hyphens; keep the "i" lowercase) The abbreviation **VoIP** is fine in second reference. (See also [internet](/home/i/internet-terms) for relevant capitalization guideline)

**volatile volcano, volcanoes** (See [plurals](/home/p/plurals))

**Volkswagen** (_not_ –gon)

**vomit, vomited, vomiting**

**Von, [Van](#Van)** (When lowercase in names, such as **Wernher von Braun**, capitalize these particles only at the start of sentences or headlines: "Von Braun championed space travel …" but "Walt Disney hired von Braun.") Be aware of a person's preference or established convention. In some cases, the particle is dropped in second reference (e.g., **Ludwig van Beethoven** becomes Beethoven). In other cases, the word is uppercase in the full name and may be dropped altogether in subsequent references. (See [particles](/home/p/particles-de-du-van-von) for more details on da, de, du, van, von, etc.)

**Vodou** (capitalized) A religion founded by African-Haitian communities centuries ago (e.g., "**a Vodou priestess**"). This is the traditional French spelling (originally "_Vaodoux_"), although the French Creole variant **Voodoo** remains common in Louisiana. For consistency, however, stick with Vodou outside of proper nouns (e.g., the **Voodoo Spiritual Temple and Cultural Center**). AVOID using either word in lowercase form to mean magical or superstitious beliefs (e.g., "voodoo economics") outside of directly attributed quotes.

**vs.** (_not v._) **Generally spell out the word "versus" in news stories.** Reserve the abbreviation for the names of court cases, headlines, and sports summaries. _Avoid_ the shorter abbreviation "v."

**vuvuzela** (singular), **vuvuzelas** (plural) South African noisemakers popular at soccer games. The traditional stadium horns are about a metre long and make a sonorous monotone. Modern vuvuzelas are often plastic. Critics say the horns are too loud and distracting. Defenders say vuvuzelas are an important part of South African sports culture.
 (See also [FIFA World Cup](/home/f/fifa-world-cup-2010) for related soccer terms and names, including the [**preferred pronunciation of vuvuzela**](/home/f/fifa-world-cup-2010#miscellaneous))

### verb agreement

**Verb agreement** (plural versus singular)

Subjects and verbs can be at odds. The inconsistency _are_ usually obvious. In the last sentence "are" is clearly out of place — which is another way of saying that the inconsistency _is_ obvious. But sometimes writing requires careful deconstruction before a ruling can be made.

Consider this line from the Ottawa Citizen:

> _Kagan's list of hopes that parents have for their children do not seem to jive with the literature or my own experience._


It should be _**does** not seem_ to jive because the verb does is tied to **_Kagan's list_**. (The example is cited by Oxford's Guide to Canadian English Usage.)

**In some cases, the correct verb is debatable because the subject can be viewed as singular or plural.** There are **five broad categories** worth reviewing:

1. [Collective nouns](/home/v/verb-agreement#collectivenouns) (couple, family, RCMP, etc.)
2. [Sports teams and musical groups](/home/v/verb-agreement#teamsandgroups)
3. [Measurements](/home/v/verb-agreement#measurements) (money, time, weight, etc.)
4. [Tricks with "ics"](/home/v/verb-agreement#ics) (ethics, politics, etc.)
5. [Composite themes](/home/v/verb-agreement#themes) (tar and feather, etc.)

**1\. Collective nouns**
Word such as **"family," "staff," and "couple"** are a frequent source of confusion because **we sometimes imply the group while at other times we mean members of the group.**

Since English is flexible enough to give us options, **pick what's most natural for the context and remain consistent within a sentence:**

> _If his family **show** up_ (not shows up), **_they_** (not "it") _will probably come by train._
>
> _His family **is**_ (not are) _going to Europe._ 
>
> _Each couple **is** asked to donate $100._ 
>
>     (Couple viewed as a single group here.) 
>
> _The couple got divorced last year, and **they**_ (not "it") _now live in different cities._
>
>     (Couple thought of as plural in this case.)


**Use the same approach for certain proper nouns** (e.g., "the Taliban is/are"), **keeping in mind that preferences have sometimes been established** through convention (e.g., "the RCMP are" in most cases):

> _The Taliban **are**_ (more natural than "is") _living in caves in the area._
>
>     (Members of the Taliban emphasized here.)
>
> _She said the Taliban **was**_ (more natural than "were") _a misogynistic regime._ 
>
> (The Taliban as a ruling body emphasized here.)
>
> _The RCMP **are**_ (preferred to "is") _investigating._ 
>
>     (Members of the police force emphasized here.) 
>
> _The RCMP has_ (preferred to "have") _a new commissioner._ 
>
>     (The police force itself emphasized here.)


See [RCMP are versus RCMP is](/home/r/rcmp-are-versus-rcmp-is) for a more detailed explanation


**Couple**
Couple is worth a couple of extra words, since it crops up quite a bit. **The New York Times recommends treating the word as a plural most of the time, since we're usually emphasizing a relationship between two distinct individuals:**

> _The couple argued a lot. **They**_ (not it) _tossed insults and glassware at each other._
>
> _The couple **were** married in 1975. They_ (not it) _had **their**_ (not its) _first child two years later._


**Once you pick a form, be sure not to switch in the middle of the stream:**

Wrong: _That couple **was**_ (singular) _the richest in the area. **They**_ (plural) _bought ..._

(For more on "they," see [problems with pronouns](/home/p/problems-with-pronouns))


**2\. Sports teams, musical groups, etc.**
**In general, treat the names of sports teams as plural nouns** even if they don't end with an "s." This is a well-established convention:

> _The Miami Heat **have** signed another forward._
>
> _The Edmonton Elks **are** trading their star quarterback._


When the names of communities are used alone instead, however, the noun is singular.

> _The Colorado Avalanche **win**._
>
> _The Avalanche **win**._
>
> _Colorado **wins**._
>
> _The Toronto Blue Jays **have** fortified their bullpen._
>
> _The Blue Jays **have** fortified their bullpen._
>
> _Toronto **has** fortified its bullpen._


**In general, treat the names of musical groups as singular nouns unless these end in an "s."** In North America, this is a well-established convention:

> _U2 is planning another world tour._
>
> _The Clash **was** virtually unknown in the U.S. until 1980._
>
> _The Rolling Stones **have** released a new album._


**In these cases, be sure to avoid adding apostrophes to false possessives** (e.g., the Leafs winger liked Beatles songs versus the Leafs' last Stanley Cup victory was just before the Beatles' breakup). See ['s versus s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s) for more details.

Also, remember that sports teams and musical groups always take lowercase definite articles, except at the beginning of sentences (e.g., the Rolling Stones not The Rolling Stones). See [the versus The](/home/t/the-versus-the) for more details.


**3\. Money, time, weight, etc.**
**Plural measurements of money, time, weight and so forth almost always take singular verbs because they're usually viewed as a unit:**

> _Forty dollars **is** missing from her purse._ 
>
>     (not are missing, since the focus is the sum)
>
> _Five kilograms **is** a lot of beef._
>
> _Three weeks **is** enough time._
>
> _Twenty million litres of fuel **was** on the ship._


**But:**

> _Three days **have** passed since the quake._ 
>
>     (days referred to separately, not as a unit)
>
> _Eight million barrels of oil **were** sold._


**In some cases, either approach is correct depending on emphasis:**

> _Two inches of snow **is** not much._ 
>
>     (focus is the sum of snow)
>
> _Six inches of snow **is** on the ground._ 
>
>     (focus is the sum of snow)
>
> _Six inches of snow **have** fallen during the past 24 hours._ 
>
>     (focus is on individual units)


**At other times, there is only one option** (based on the sentence's subject):

> _Lots of rain **has** fallen._ 
>
>     (not have, since "lots of" is comparable to the adjective "much")
>
> _Lots of apples **have** fallen off the truck._
>
>     (not has, since "lots of" is comparable to the adjective "many")


**4\. Tricks with "ics"**
**Several words that end with "ics" (classics, ethics, politics, etc.) may take either plural or singular verbs, depending on the context:**

> _Ethics **is** a tough course._ 
>
>     (field of study)
>
> _Your ethics **are** questionable._ 
>
>     (beliefs)
>
> _Politics **is** not as rewarding as she hoped._ 
>
>     (public service, governing)
>
> _Politics **have** a lot to do with it._ 
>
>     (partisan positions, ideological views)


**5\. Composite themes** (tar and feather)
Two or more words sometimes form what grammarians call **a "composite theme."**

These are **treated as a single subject. But deciding what falls into this category can be highly subjective.** Here are two examples from Fowler's 1998 Modern English Usage:

(a) _The extent and severity of alcoholism in Russia **has** been a shock to the visiting addiction counsellors_ should probably be **_have been_** a shock because "extent" and "severity" do not form a single theme. (The writer is making two comments about alcoholism, not one, since something can be widespread but not very serious.)

(b) On the other hand, _Tarring and feathering **was** too good for him_ is OK because here "tarring and feathering" constitutes a single act of punishment that would not be conveyed adequately with a plural verb.

So _chicken and beef **are** on the menu,_ but _gin and tonic **is** a good combination._
Be aware that **conventional usage can be a factor in determining composite themes**. The expression "truth and reconciliation," for example, has been frequently considered a singular subject since the end of apartheid in South Africa in the 1990s — e.g., _truth and reconciliation **begins**_ and **_means_** and **_is_** rather than _truth and reconciliation begin_ and mean and _are_.

**[we-wh](/home/w#we)**

**[wi-wy](/home/w#wi)**

**w-wd**
[_**W5**_](/home/w/w-five) (not _W-5_ or _W-FIVE_) for the name of a CTV investigative reporting unit. Until 2024, it was a standalone TV current affairs program.

**wacky** (_not_ whacky)

**wagon, bandwagon, chuckwagon, station wagon**

Wailing Wall (_prefer_ [**Western Wall**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westernwall) for this site in Jerusalem)

**waitlist** (n. and v.), as in "_Fans were put on a waitlist for tickets_" and "_They were waitlisted_."

**waive** (dispense with, give up, forgo), as in "They waived the fee" and "She got a waiver." (_Frequently misspelled as wave or waver_)

****wake-up call*

*walkie-talkie****

**Walkman** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for small portable stereo with headphones)

**walk out** (v.), **walkout** (n.)

**wall**
wall painting (_mural_), wallpaper, wall space, wall-to-wall carpeting, Berlin Wall, Great Wall of China, Wall Street, [Western Wall](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westernwall)

**Walmart** (fused, lowercase "m") The company started using "Walmart" on its store signs in late 2008, and now prefers this spelling in virtually all documents, including news releases. Although the company's legal name remains slightly different (Wal-Mart), we adopted Walmart as our style in 2014 because this is how the company is now known to most people. For simplicity and consistency, therefore, prefer this spelling across the board (**Walmart, Walmart Stores Inc., Walmart Canada Corp.**, etc.) Since abbreviations such as Inc. and Corp. are conventionally used only in business journalism, the nouns **Walmart** or **Walmart Canada** are generally sufficient in most of our reporting. See [names versus logos](/home/n/names-versus-logos) for additional background on the switch from Wal-Mart to Walmart.

[**war**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-terms-overview/#war "Military terms overview") (broad term to describe various types of ongoing hostilities, such as the **civil war in Syria** and the **war in Ukraine**); [**War** versus **war**](/home/w/war) (**cold war** and **war of words** but the **Second World War** and the **Vietnam War**)

**war crimes** (the violation of laws or conventions governing armed conflict) War crimes are generally linked to unacceptable treatment of prisoners and civilians. Such allegations are often dealt with by permanent tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which also handles accusations of [genocide](/home/g/genocide) and other crimes against humanity. Not all countries are formal members of the International Criminal Court, however, and some prosecute their own accusations of war crimes, revising the definition based on their own laws (e.g., charging alleged terrorists with fighting on foreign soil without the authority of that land's government). Since this use of the term "war crime" can be controversial, however, qualifying language is generally recommended (e.g., U.S.-laid or U.S.-prosecuted war crimes in the case of the military hearings in Guantanamo Bay). See the October 2010 editorial note about [War crimes and Khadr coverage](/updates/2010/2010-10-26) for details.

**War Measures Act** (repealed by the Parliament of Canada in 1988) Replaced by the [**Emergencies Act**](/home/e#EmergenciesAct)

**war resister** (prefer this term when specifically referring to military personnel who haven't been convicted of desertion). See [**deserter** versus **resister**](/home/d/deserter-versus-resister) for details.

**Ward 4, Ward 11, the hospital ward**

**
\-ward (suffix)**
Prefer the suffix -ward (no "s") at the end of words like backward, forward, toward, etc. (See [\-ward versus -wards](/home/w/ward-versus-wards))

**warez** (n) This slang term should be defined in stories if the context does not make the meaning clear. It refers to illegal copies of software distributed online after the security code has been cracked. The word, believed to be a humorous misspelling of "wares," is often associated with a web culture that passionately advocates spreading pirated content.

****warhorse, warlord, warmonger****

**wartime** (see also [War versus war](/home/w/war))

**Washington, D.C.** (The U.S. capital, which has a [Capitol Hill](/home/c/capital-capitol)) When the context is clear, it's normally OK to refer to Washington alone (e.g., "Washington and Ottawa have expressed doubt about the UN proposal"). Otherwise, add D.C. to distinguish from the state. See [United States](/home/u/united-states) for a list of U.S. cities that do not need state or district abbreviations after them in first reference.

**Washington (Wash.)** The place directly below British Columbia. To distinguish from the U.S. capital, it's often helpful to add the word "state" (e.g., "Washington state officials agreed") unless the context is already clear (e.g., "Washington's governor is chairing the panel"). See also [United States](/home/u/united-states) for related guidelines.

**[WASP](/home/w/wasp)** (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant) _Generally avoid this disparaging and outmoded term_ outside of historical references to fact-based, academic writing that literally compares, say, Protestants to Catholics.

**Wassermann test** (named after a German doctor, August von Wassermann) Keep three things in mind: (i) The spelling is tricky. (2) Many readers won't know that it's a test for syphilis, so this needs to be explained. (3) And when writing about syphilis, be specific and clear by spelling out the abbreviation STD as "sexually transmitted disease."

**wastebasket, wastewater** (fused), but **waste product, waste stream** (two words)

****watchdog*

*waterfowl****

**University of Waterloo** (_not_ Waterloo University) See also [universities](/home/u/universities-and-colleges)

the web, web browser, webcam (see [camera](/home/c#camera) for related guidelines), webcast, web-enabled, webmaster, web page, web publishing, web server, website, web streaming, web writing. Use a capital "W" only when WWW is spelled out in full as **World Wide Web**. (See also [internet terms](/home/i/internet-terms) for general guidelines and [URL](/home/u/urls) for specific points on handling web addresses.)

****weird, weirdo****

**Welland Canal** (_unnecessary_ to call it the Welland Ship Canal)

**well**
Most, but not all, compound adjectives featuring the word "well" have a hyphen when used attributively (i.e., before the noun being modified). Some common exceptions are included below. When the combination appears after the noun, however, the hyphen is generally dropped (e.g., _a **well-cut** diamond_ versus _a diamond that's **well cut**_). Some compound nouns featuring "well" always have a hyphen (e.g., **well-being** and **well-wishers**). (See also [hyphens](/handy-links/punctuation/hyphens))

ADJECTIVES BEFORE NOUNS BEING MODIFIED (e.g., _A well-known person_)
**well-balanced, well-behaved, well-built, well-chosen, well-defined, well-deserved, well-developed, well done** (no hyphen), **well-educated, well equipped** (no hyphen), **well-kept, well-known, well-liked, well-lit, well-loved, well-made, well off** (no hyphen), **well-organized, well-paid, well placed** (no hyphen), **well-planned, well-prepared, well-preserved, well-read, well-received, well-rounded, well-spent, well-spoken, well-stocked, well-suited, well-to-do, well-used, well versed** (no hyphen), **well-worn**

COMPOUNDS AFTER NOUNS BEING MODIFIED (e.g., _She's well known_)
**well aware, well balanced, well behaved, well built, well chosen, well defined, well deserved, well developed, well done, well educated, well equipped, well kept, well known, well liked, well lit, well loved, well made, well off, well organized, well paid, well placed, well planned, well prepared, well preserved, well read, well received, well rounded, well spent, well spoken, well stocked, well suited, well-to-do, well used, well versed, well worn**

**Welsh** (Refers to people, language, etc. of Wales, although "Welch" is used in the official names of many military regiments) _Do not use the slur_ "welsh on a bet."

**West, Western** versus **west, western** (See [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west))

[**West Bank**](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westbank) ("of the River Jordan" is implied)

**West Coast** (see West in [North, South, East and Wes](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west)t for general guidelines)

**West End** (London theatre district)

**western(s)** All genres, such as science fiction and westerns, are lowercase. ("It’s a western" and "It appears that westerns are making a comeback at the box office.") See also [North, South, East and West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west) for West, Western versus **west, western**

**Western Canadian Select (WCS)** A blend of heavy oil (bitumen, conventional oil, synthetic crude) from Alberta. Considered a benchmark price for heavy oil. WCS is often compared to the per-barrel price of lighter density crude, such as **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)**. Be aware that the C in WCS is sometimes spelled out as "Canada." For consistency, however, prefer the attributive noun "Canadian," which is the older and more common form. When using names like WCS or WTI, be sure that a given story's context makes their meanings clear. Otherwise, briefly define/explain.

**Western University** (second reference, **Western**) In 2012, the University of Western Ontario officially adopted the name Western University. The longer noun remains the school's legal name, and continues to be used on students' degrees and transcripts. But Western University is now preferred in news stories. For this reason, _avoid_ the abbreviation UWO unless it's explained. And always include a geographical reference high in stories to make the school's identity clear (e.g., "London, Ont.-based," or "Ontario's" Western University). See also [universities and colleges](/home/u/universities-and-colleges) for general guidelines.

**Western Wall** (site in Jerusalem) Preferred over Wailing Wall. See the [Middle East glossary](/home/m/middle-east-glossary#westernwall) for details and related language guidelines

**WestJet Airlines Ltd.** (WestJet Airlines or WestJet are fine on first reference)

**Westminster** (_not_ -minister)

**West Nile virus**

**West Texas Intermediate (WTI)** Commonly used as the benchmark price of crude oil (See also [**WCS**](/home/w#WCS))

**West Virginia (W.Va.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**wharf, wharfs** (See [plurals](/home/p/plurals) for an overview)

**WhatsApp** (global messaging service) Founded in 2009. Purchased by Facebook in 2014.

**wheat** (Marquis versus durum) See [grain](/home/g/grain)

**wheelchair** (_avoid_ phrases such as "confined to a wheelchair" and "wheelchair-bound") See [disability terms](/home/d/disability-language#wheelchairs) for details

**whereabouts** (Use _a singular verb when referring to one person,_ as in "Her whereabouts is unknown," but a plural verb for more than one, as in "Their whereabouts are unknown.")

**whip, party whip** (See [titles](/home/t/titles))

**[whisky](/home/w/whisky), whiskies** (never whiskey)

**whisky jack** (use this spelling) Common Canadian bird, also known as the **[grey jay](/home/g/grey_jay)** (See also [whisky instead of whiskey](/home/w/whisky))

**whistleblower** (no hyphen)

**Whitehorse, Yukon** (See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities))

**white** (See [racial terms](/home/r/racial-terms))

**White House**

**[whitelist](/home/g/gyp)** (avoid unless attributed; the same caveat applies to "blacklist")

**white nationalism** (a racist ideology that promotes either white-only or white-dominated citizenry); **white supremacy** is one common subgroup of white nationalism, while **white separatism** is another. If a given group or person is known to be white supremacist (e.g., the Ku Klux Klan), prefer this more specific wording in stories (i.e., white supremacy instead of white nationalism). Otherwise, the more general description is probably best. Be aware that some people's irrational bigotry may be more rooted in distrust and a fear of integration than in actual supremacy (e.g., opposition to interracial marriage). Be cautious when labelling anyone a white nationalist or a white supremacist. Usual libel guidelines apply. When in doubt, consult a senior journalist or the CBC Law Department.

****widescreen, widescreen TV****

**wield**

**wiener, wiener schnitzel**

**Wi-Fi** (instead of spelling it out as "wireless fidelity" in first reference, provide readers with a general description that's readily understood, such as "wireless network")

**wigwag** (no hyphen) To move lightly back and forth, like a flag in a breeze.

**WikiLeaks** (see also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for general guidelines)

**wildcat strike** (_avoid using as a mere synonym for illegal strike_) A wildcat strike is a sudden walkout not authorized by the union. The protest is almost always illegal because the workers are either not in a legal strike position or have not given the employer proper notice. Although wildcat strikes can reflect a high level of anger toward management, they can also signal dissatisfaction within the union itself. (See [strike](/home/s#strike) for related guidelines)

**wildfire** [Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/forest-forestry/wildland-fires/forest-fires) defines a wildland fire, also known as a wildfire, as “any ignition, natural or planned, that burns in wildland areas and consumes natural fuels (trees, brush, grass, etc.).” As that agency notes, “forest fires, grassland fires, cultural fires and prescribed burns are all considered wildland fires.” Note then that [wildfires and forest fires are not necessarily synonymous](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-05-15-wildfires-and-forest-fires/ "2025 05 15 - Wildfires and forest fires").

**Wildrose Alliance Party** (Alberta political party formed in 2008 and **dissolved in 2017 as part of a merger to create the [United Conservative Party](/home/u#UCP))** The Wildrose Alliance Party was the official electoral name of the Wildrose Alliance Political Association, later shortened to the Wildrose Political Association. It's generally OK to use the abridged version **Wildrose Party**, even in first reference. Wildrose alone is fine as a modifier (e.g., a **Wildrose member**) See [Party versus party](/home/p/party) for related capitalization guidelines.

****the Wild West****

**wilful** (_not_ willful)

****[wind chill](/home/w/weather-words#windchill)****

**[wind direction](/home/w/weather-words#winddirection)** (a "south wind" blows _from_ the south, etc.)

**windstorm** (but **plow wind**) See also [weather words](/home/w/weather-words)

**[wines and spirits](/home/w/wines_spirits)** (general guidelines) Chardonnay. Kahlua, Riesling but champagne, cognac and scotch

****Winter Olympic Games, the Winter Olympics, the Winter Games, the Games****

**[wire copy](/home/w/wire-copy)** (detailed guidelines for CBC.ca)

**Wisconsin (Wis.)** See [United States](/home/u/united-states)

**wit, halfwit, halfwitted**, kept her **wits**, at his **wit’s** end

**Wite-Out** (no h) is the brand name of a correction fluid. A generic alternative is "liquid paper." (See also [trade names](/home/t/trade-names))

****withdraw, withdrawal*

*withhold****

**witness** (singular), **witnesses** (plural); **witness's testimony** (singular possessive), **witnesses' testimony** (plural possessive) See also [s' versus s's](/handy-links/punctuation/s-versus-s-s)

**witness box** (use "box" rather than "stand" for Canadian court stories) See [Canadian court terms](/home/c/canadian-court-terms) for details

**woke** (OK in literal sense of being awake) The expression "they woke up" has been a conversational alternative to "they awakened" for centuries; **woke** (**_avoid in figurative sense unless attributed_**) The use of "woke" to mean social enlightenment began in the 1960s. It became politicized in the late 2010s, however, and now has different meanings, depending on the speaker or writer. To "**be woke**" initially referred to being aware of issues of racial inequality and other injustices. But the expression has taken on a separate, derogatory definition, especially among conservatives, who routinely use "woke" to describe what they consider unjustified overreactions by various activists and their supporters (e.g., "woke corporations" and "woke policies"). For this reason, the word should be attributed in our journalism. Keep in mind that if the specific meaning of "woke" is not obvious in a given case, additional context may be necessary.

**Wolesi Jirga** (capitalized) Afghanistan's [lower house of parliament](/home/l/legislative-bodies). Compare with **[Loya Jirga](/home/l#LoyaJirga)**.

**woman, man** (Generally avoid as adjectives. Prefer [female, male](/home/f/femalemale).)

[**women and children**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/updates/2025/2025-06-03-women-and-children/ "2025 06 03 - Women and children") CBC News should avoid using “women and children” as a synonym for civilians, or as an indication of innocence or blamelessness. We should, rather, evaluate whether details such as age and gender are relevant to the audience’s understanding of a story.

**womenswear, menswear**

**woollen, woolly**

****word processor, word processing****

[**Workers** versus **Workers’**](/home/w/workers) **Compensation Board** (Names vary across the country)

**work (prefix)
**Most compounds in this category are fused (**workbench, workday, workflow, workforce, workload, workout, workplace, workspace, workstation**). But a few remain two words (**work hours, work table**) based on convention.

**work (suffix)**
Several of these compounds are fused (e.g., **artwork, handwork, latticework, woodwork**). Many others, however, are two words (**classical work, dance work, literary work, musical work**). When uncertain, check the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

**work-to-rule, work-to-rule campaign**

**World Trade Center** (_not Centre_) because it was the proper name of the structure destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks. **WTC** on second reference. The site can also be called **Ground Zero** (uppercase) in stories about the collapse of the two towers. Use the abbreviated form of the month ([**Sept. 11**](/home/s#Sept11), **not** September 11). **9/11** is fine in headlines. Write the "Sept. 11 attacks" not "terrorist attacks." See also [terrorism and terrorist](/home/t/terrorist-and-terrorism), as well as [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre)

**World War I** (WW I), **World War II** (WW II) On air, CBC News has discouraged use of the terms "World War One" and "World War Two" for years. The main reason: Placing a figure at the beginning rather than at the end of an expression is considered more natural to the ear (e.g., the First World War, the second day of the conference, his third serving of ice cream). In most stories, _generally prefer_ **First World War** and **Second World War**. In web headlines, however, **WW I** and **WW II** are allowed because they’re short and commonly understood. In these cases, always use [roman numerals](/home/n/numbers#arabicroman), continue to use the same style throughout the body of the story (WW I and WW II) to match the headline, and spell out the abbreviation WW once in first reference (World War I). Note the space between the letters and roman numerals: A long-lost WW II sub. A WW I-era gun.

**worldwide**, _but_ **World Wide Web (WWW)** as an entrenched name (See [web](/home/w#web))

**World Wildlife Fund** (_not_ Federation) Although better known outside North America by a new name adopted in the 1980s ("the World Wide Fund For Nature"), prefer the original noun from the 1960s (World Wildlife Fund) in all stories. This shorter form remains the organization's legal name in Canada and the United States. Always specify which member of the WWF global network is being referred to (e.g., "She joined WWF-Japan in 1978" and "The proposal was made by WWF-Austria's conservation director"). Generally use **World Wildlife Fund-Canada** in first reference. **WWF-Canada** is OK in second reference, as well as in web headlines.

### W five

**_W5_**

**Refer to this CTV current affairs investigative unit as _W5_.**

Originally, _W5_ was the name of one of CTV's longest-running television programs. It first aired in the fall of 1966. The proper noun's spelling changed slightly several times over the next half a century (e.g., _W-5_, "_W5 with Eric Malling_" and _W-Five_). In the fall of 2009, _W-Five_ became _W5_.

**In 2024, CTV announced that the standalone program was being cancelled** because of budget cuts, **but that the established W5 brand would continue to be used** for a range of investigative reports across its platforms.

Be aware that, technically, the show was called _W-FIVE_ (all uppercase) for many years. But most major news services (including The Canadian Press and CBC) referred to it as W-Five back then. That's because **we don’t generally put entire names in capital letters. We also write Amtrak** (not AMTRAK), **Ikea** (not IKEA), **Scrabble** (not SCRABBLE), **Via Rail** (not VIA Rail), **Visa** (not VISA), etc. **This is a standard approach to capitalization.**

Be aware, too, that in online news stories, we normally impose standard capitalization on program titles to help our audience scan for comprehension, regardless of the way shows brand themselves through logos, etc. For example: **_Play_** (not >_play_) and **_Counterspin_** (not _counterSpin_). See also [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization).

Related reminder: Program names and their equivalents should be rendered in [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) in our web journalism. For consistency, this includes **_W5_**.

### War

**War versus war**

**Capitalize “war” in the names of major armed conflicts:**

War of the Roses
War of 1812
Civil War (U.S.)
First World War (_preferred, but see [WW I](/home/w#WW1WW2) for headline use_)
1991 [Persian Gulf War](/home/p/persian-gulf-war)
Second World War (_preferred, but see [WW II](/home/w#WW1WW2) for headline use_)
Six-Day War
Korean War
Vietnam War

**Generally use lowercase in all other contexts:**

antiwar protests
the war in Iraq
they predict a third world war
war against drugs
war against poverty
cod war
trade war
warhorse, warlord, warmonger, wartime
but Cold War (_widely used name for a specific_ [historical period](/home/h/historical-periods))
[War Measures Act](/home/e#EmergenciesAct) (_name of legislation_)
War and Peace (_name of book_)

See also [capitalization](/home/c/capitalization) (an overview)
See also [military terms](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/military-terms-overview/#miscellaneous "Military terms overview") for general editorial guidelines (e.g., **war, incursion, invasion**)

### Ward versus wards

**\-ward versus -wards**

_Is it backward or backwards? Forward or forwards?_

Although the "s" is normally dropped in the case of adjectives (e.g., a _backward policy_), Canadians do not appear to have a preference at the end of adverbs (e.g., _they moved backward versus they moved backwards_), according to Oxford's Guide to Canadian English Usage.


**Use -ward**
For simplicity and consistency, we follow the lead of the Globe and Mail and some other news organizations and **use -ward** (not _\-wards_) **at the end of all words indicating direction or time:**


_**afterward, backward, downward, inward, forward, outward, toward, upward**_, etc.

**This preference applies to adverbs** ("he slipped backward") **as well as adjectives** ("a downward glance").

### Warsaw pact

**Warsaw Pact** (former)

This term refers to **an agreement signed by the old Soviet Union and some eastern European countries in 1955** called the _Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Assistance.
_
The alliance was formed as **a response to the creation of NATO**. Although it was officially known as the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the “Warsaw Pact” is a widely used and acceptable label for both the treaty and the organization.

**The Warsaw Pact was officially disbanded in the summer of 1991.** Some members have since joined NATO.
**In stories, write “the former Warsaw Pact”** _in first reference_, and then the old treaty, the former pact, the disbanded Warsaw alliance, etc. after that

See also [Soviet Union](/home/s/soviet-union)

### WASP

**WASP**

Stands for **white Anglo-Saxon Protestant**. The abbreviation, popularized by sociologists in the 1960s, has since morphed into a family of nouns and modifiers, including: **WASPy, WASPish, WASPiness**.

Generally **avoid the acronym in any of its various forms unless attributed** (i.e., in a broadcast clip or directly transcribed quote), **especially as a synonym for "whiteness"** or for members of a specific socio-economic white community. **Even when attributed, be aware that WASP is widely considered inaccurate and offensive** because **it implies that followers of a specific form of Christianity represent a much larger, monolithic Caucasian group** (e.g., the white middle class, or a given society's white elite).

**WASP is flagged by the Canadian Oxford Dictionary as "usually derogatory."** Various commentators have complained about its relatively common and mindless usage for decades, given the direct ties to Protestantism. In 1988, for example, American writer Edward Hoagland called the cudgel "**WASPy**" as jarring, hurtful and inappropriate as "**Jewy**."

**Rare references to fact-based academic works that LITERALLY describe the historical influence of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants remain OK** — e.g., when WASPs are compared to, say, white Catholics or to white eastern Europeans — such as in this [Canadian Encyclopedia's overview of The Vertical Mosaic](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fvertical-mosaic&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2Ktrvt6_fb_wYOWBPTw5sJ), the seminal 1965 book by sociologist John Porter:


> _"Members of the British “charter group” (**white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant or WASP**) were greatly overrepresented at the top levels of the occupational and reward structures of Canadian society.... Elites came overwhelmingly from **WASP** upper- and upper-middle class backgrounds...."
> _

> > — The Canadian Encyclopedia


**Otherwise, steer clear of the term** (e.g., "mainly white suburbs" rather than "WASPy suburbs").

### Weapons

**Weapons**
[Firearms overview](/home/w/weapons#firearms) (various definitions and caveats)



[Assault rifle vs. assault-style rifle](/home/w/weapons#assault_rifle) (military vs. military-style)
[By the numbers](/home/w/weapons#handguns) (9-mm pistol, .22-calibre rifle, etc.)
[Military](/home/w/weapons#military) (missiles, mortars, salvos, tanks, volleys, etc.)

**Firearms** (overview)
**Be precise** when reporting on firearms. **Specify relevant details** (e.g., rifles versus handguns, automatic versus semi-automatic, prohibited versus restricted). **Use language that's accurate and meaningful.** If you're uncertain, check. **Certain wording is incontestably wrong** (e.g., calling a shotgun a rifle). **Other language is broader and may be OK** in various contexts. For example, **the term "gun" is acceptable for any firearm.** But **very few pistols can accurately be called revolvers**.

Here are some general guidelines:

-   Generally **limit use of the word "weapon" in stories about gun safety.** The Criminal Code of Canada defines a firearm as "a barrelled weapon." But gun owners are correct when they point out that Canada issues "firearms licences" and registration certificates for "prohibited firearms" and "restricted firearms" under the federal Firearms Act. **The term weapon is always OK when specifically referring to armed attacks**, such as deadly shootings, military conflicts, etc. It's **also fine as an occasional synonym** in other stories. **But repeatedly using "weapon" as the default term for gun is perceived as biased by some people**. They liken it to always calling a knife a weapon — even when interviewing chefs about kitchen accidents. For this reason, **more specific language** (e.g., firearm, rifle) **is often a better choice**, especially in coverage of public policy debates.

-   [**Automatic weapons**](/home/w/weapons#automatic) keep firing as long as the trigger is pulled and there are bullets left (i.e., rounds in the magazine).

-   [**Semi-automatic weapons**](/home/w/weapons#automatic) reload after each shot but don't fire again unless the trigger is pulled once more.

-   **The word "assault" requires special care.** There's no universal definition, and only sporadic attempts at statutory meaning in some countries (e.g., Washington's now-expired 1994 federal "assault weapons ban" in the U.S. Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, which outlawed certain semi-automatic rifles for 10 years). Reserve the term "**assault rifle**" for military-grade, fully automatic weapons. In other cases, use [**assault-style rifle**](/home/w/weapons#assault_rifle).

-   A firearm's **magazine is a storage device that holds extra ammunition**. There are many types. Some weapons are fed new rounds from belts, for instance, while others rely on either fixed or detachable compartments. **Detachable magazines are often called clips**.

-   **A cartridge is a casing that includes an explosive charge and a bullet or other projectile** (e.g., steel pellets). **Magnum is a trademark for a high-powered cartridge**, as in a .44-calibre Magnum.

-   The adjectives high-powered and high-power are equally correct. For consistency, however, prefer "-powered," as in a **high-powered firearm**. "Power," in this context, conventionally means the type of ammunition fired, as well as its velocity, distance travelled and penetrating force on impact.


-   The words **handgun and pistol are interchangeable** in news stories.

-   **Revolvers are handguns that have cartridges in revolving cylinders** made famous in Hollywood westerns. Some modern weapons still fall into this category, including the .357-calibre Magnum revolver.

-   **Rifles have grooved bores and fire bullets from cartridges.** The rifling spins the bullets, increasing their range and accuracy.

-   **Shotguns have smooth bores and fire pellets of lead or steel (called "shot") packed in shells containing powder.** Some shotguns are double-barrelled.

-   **Long guns generally requires two hands to use** effectively, and are normally braced against the shoulder. **Shotguns are one type. Standard rifles are another.** The noun long gun has a hyphen when used as an adjective (long-gun registry, long-gun owner).

-   **Carbines are rifles with shorter barrels** — commonly used by the military and police tactical units because they're lighter and easier to handle. It's an umbrella term. There are many types of carbines. Avoid the redundancy "carbine rifle," since carbines are by definition rifles.

-   Barrel becomes **barrelled** as a modifier (two l's) in Canadian English, as in **short-barrelled** rifle, **double-barrelled** gun.

-   **Machine-guns can accurately and repeatedly fire rifle-size ammunition for a long time** without overheating. Some of these weapons require more than one person to load, aim and shoot.

-   **Submachine-guns fire pistol-size ammunition.** They're much lighter than machine-guns, but they're also less accurate and have shorter ranges.

-   **Pick the noun that's most familiar to our audience** (e.g., an AK-74 rather than a Kalashnikov assault rifle, assuming the widely used model number is accurate). See the ["by the numbers"](/home/w/weapons#handguns) technical jargon section below for a caution about AK-series rifles. **If important detail is left out of a colloquial name, be sure that the story provides the context** (e.g., a Thompson machine-gun is often called a tommy-gun, but not everyone knows the latter is a type of machine-gun).

-   [**Tasers**](/home/t#Taser) are a specific type of stun gun. The T is capitalized because it's proprietary. **Air guns** use compressed air (or other gases) instead of combustible propellants to shoot projectiles.

-   **Make sure that all images of weapons used in a story apply**. For example, **avoid pictures of pistols in graphics about the old long-gun registry** introduced by Ottawa in 1995 and ended in 2012. Coverage of that registry, or a similar registry introduced in Quebec in 2018, should focus on non-restricted rifles and shotguns. (See [licensing versus registration](/home/w/weapons#registration) below for details.)

**Non-restricted, restricted, prohibited**
**Canada does not actually define "assault" or "combat" weapons in either the Firearms Act or the Criminal Code of Canada. Instead,** federal legislation refers to **three classifications:
**

> **1\. Non-restricted** (e.g., many shotguns, many rifles).
>
> **2\. Restricted** (e.g., most handguns, most semi-automatic guns).
>
> **3\. Prohibited** (e.g., fully automatic firing, unlawfully powerful, illegally altered).


There are **also detailed regulations about everything from ammunition** (e.g., the size of magazines) **to the safe transportation, storage and use of firearms. This includes where restricted weapons can be fired.** For instance, virtually no one except law enforcement officers can lawfully use semi-automatic handguns outside of shooting ranges or other designated areas in Canada. In some cases, professional trappers can seek permission for limited use of such handguns in remote wilderness.


**Licensing versus registration**
It's important to distinguish between the licensing and the registering of guns. **In Canada, you need a licence to acquire and possess** (own or borrow) **any firearm, as well as to obtain ammunition.** The RCMP manages licences under the Canadian Firearms Program. Licences must be renewed.

By contrast, **registration rules are more complex. All restricted and prohibited firearms must be registered in a special database** (i.e., officially logged and assigned a unique registration number to the weapon, which remains in place even if ownership of the weapon changes). This includes all handguns. **But laws about the registration of non-restricted firearms have changed** in recent years. For example, **in 2012 the controversial long-run registry was officially scrapped** by the federal government, which meant non-restricted firearms (e.g., standard hunting rifles and shotguns) no longer needed to be registered. **In 2018,  however, Quebec introduced its own long-gun registry.**

**Common errors:**

-   **Implying that non-restricted firearms are not controlled.** You still need a licence to own virtually any gun, and to get ammunition.
-   **Implying that there's no longer a gun registry in Canada.** All restricted and prohibited weapons must be registered, including handguns.
-   **Implying that Canadians no longer need to register non-restricted firearms.** It depends where you live.

**Automatic versus semi-automatic**
**Whenever possible, specify the type of gun** (e.g., M-16, AR-15, AK-47), **including its firing capability** (automatic or semi-automatic).

Outside of military units and special police tactical squads, firearms are almost always **semi-automatic (one round per trigger pull)** rather than **fully automatic (continuous firing as long as the trigger is pressed)**. But **this fact does not make semi-automatic firearms significantly less deadly in non-combat settings**, such as a church, park or shopping mall, where the people being targeted are usually unarmed. For example, in Connecticut in 2012, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter used a Bushmaster XM-15 — a semi-automatic, assault-style rifle similar to an AR-15. Police said he fired more than 150 bullets in less than five minutes, killing 26 people, including 20 children.

In coverage of mass shootings, public policy debates over gun control, etc., here are **some other facts worth knowing:**

-   **Semi-automatic weapons load themselves** (ejecting the spent cartridge, loading a new cartridge and cocking the firing mechanism as part of a single cycle), which means pulling the trigger in rapid succession can produce a virtually automatic burst of bullets, depending on the given firearm and its settings.

-   **Fully automatic weapons** (e.g., machine guns) **are already prohibited in many countries, including Canada.** Even in the U.S., where gun laws are far less restrictive, it's very hard to get permission to own a fully automatic weapon (especially if the firearm was manufactured after 1986). **The modifier "fully" helps underscore that the trigger needs to be pressed only once.**

-   **Most fully automatic weapons can also be set to semi-automatic mode**, so that each shot requires a trigger pull.

-   **A bump stock** is a special attachment that **lets a semi-automatic rifle virtually mimic a fully-automatic weapon.** The device uses the rifle's natural recoil to push back into the shooter's trigger finger, producing rapid, nearly continuous fire. Since "bump stock" is a relatively obscure term, it should be briefly defined/explained.

-   **A firearm's appearance can be highly misleading.** So while it's OK to include an eye-witness account of the weapons a killer may have been spotted carrying, a given rifle's esthetics may be insignificant if not irrelevant. **For example, while some rifles are large and intended to appear menacing** (e.g., painted black and fitted with big scopes), **the weapons may, in fact, be less powerful than certain automatic handguns.** By contrast, a rifle with a wooden stock might appear to look less daunting but actually shoot more powerful ammunition more rapidly — such as the semi-automatic Ruger Mini-14 used in the École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal in 1989.

**A cache of seized weapons can sometimes create a false impression.** For instance, does the pile at the front of the news conference include air guns, realistic toy guns, etc.? It's a good idea to **ask authorities for details about the weapons**, including a list of the **gun names or models**, their **basic firing power** (e.g., fully or semi-automatic, type of ammunition), and **whether they've been illegally modified** (e.g., shortened barrel, larger magazine).

**If you don't know much about firearms, double-check any details causing doubt.** There's often at least one gun buff in every newsroom. A colleague may be able to clear up confusion about specific terminology, regulations, etc.


**Assault rifle versus assault-style rifle**
**Fact-based descriptions of firearms are often clearest.** For instance:


> _"The man who killed 51 people at the Christchurch mosque in New Zealand in 2019 is believed to have modified his **two semi-automatic rifles** with high-capacity magazines so they could hold more bullets."_


**The term "assault" requires special care. Distinguish between "assault rifles" and "assault-style rifles"** whenever reporting on firearms — from breaking news about a deadly shooting to public policy debates over stricter gun control. **Using the labels interchangeably causes confusion, and can lead to accusations of inaccuracy and bias.**

-   **Assault rifle narrowly refers to military-grade, fully automatic firearms.** They're **often carbines** (i.e., they have shortened barrels designed for tactical operations). Such firearms are generally lightweight and easy to aim, often include a selector switch that can be set to either fully automatic or semi-automatic mode, and feature detachable magazines, usually with between 10 and 30 rounds. Examples: **M-16s, AK-47s** and the **C7s** now commonly issued to Canadian soldiers. **Since bona fide assault rifles are capable of fully automatic firing, they're prohibited in Canada.** (See [automatic versus semi-automatic](/home/w/weapons#automatic) as well as [non-restricted, restricted, prohibited](/home/w/weapons#restricted_prohibited) for details.)

**Assault-style rifle refers to a broad group of semi-automatic firearms.** Some may be **fashioned to look like assault rifles, but they're neither fully automatic nor military-grade** (e.g., their ammunition is different, their range is lower, their firing speed is slower). Examples: **AR-15, AR-57** and the **XM-15**. The word "style" is vital to avoid ambiguity, and to accommodate more nuanced conversations between pro-gun and anti-gun activists. Assault-style rifles are **not designed for deer hunting or protecting livestock from coyotes, but** they're also **not identical to actual assault rifles used by soldiers and special tactical teams.** Our reporting should reflect this.

Some people prefer **military-style rifle** over **assault-style rifle**. **Both are acceptable as long as the meaning is clear** (i.e., that a military-style rifle is not the same as a military-grade rifle). It's worth noting that "assault-style rifle" has become increasingly common in public policy discussions in Canada in recent years — including in the federal government roundtable hearings in 2018: [Reducing Violent Crime: A Dialogue on Handguns and Assault-Style Firearms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicsafety.gc.ca%2Fcnt%2Frsrcs%2Fpblctns%2F2019-rdcng-vlnt-crm-dlg%2Findex-en.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2f_75sVWhkoGz96FvL0aq6). The Office of the Federal Ombudsman For the Victims of Crime also used "assault-style rifle" in a [2018 report to Parliament](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.victimsfirst.gc.ca%2Fvv%2FVC-CV%2Findex.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2qV1xSVygJDkYMV57jMst6).

**Don't assume the weapon used at a [mass shooting](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mass-shooting/ "Mass shooting") is an assault rifle or an "assault-style" rifle.** It may turn out to be a high-powered **sniper rifle** designed for distance, such as an SR-25.


CAUTION: **In breaking news about a deadly shooting, try to confirm as much information as possible about the weapon(s) — not to use the jargon in stories, necessarily, but simply to verify whether certain wording applies.** In 2016, for instance, virtually all media claimed that a man had used an AR-15 in a nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida (i.e., an "assault-style rifle"). Fifty people died, including the gunman, and dozens of others were injured. Within 24 hours, however, officials confirmed the killer actually used a Sig Sauer MCX carbine designed for military use (i.e., an "assault rifle"). The police, it turns out, had vaguely described the weapon as an "AR-15 style" rifle without providing more details. Such **mislabelling can prompt law-abiding rifle owners to level accusations of bias and ignorance against news organizations** — putting journalists on the defensive and impeding fact-based debates over the merits of stricter gun control.



**By the numbers** (9-mm pistol, .22-calibre rifle, etc.)
**Rifles, pistols and other small arms are usually identified by the diameter of their barrels (measured inside). This figure, known as calibre, is expressed either in metric or in decimal fractions of an inch.** The word calibre is not used with metric units. Note the use of hyphens:


> _9-mm pistol_
>
> _75-mm gun_
>
> _.357-calibre Magnum_
>
> _.22-calibre rifle_
>
> _.45-calibre automatic_
>
> _.22-calibre rifle_
>
> _.30-30 gun_ (only one decimal; a specific type of _.30-calibre firearm_)


**The names of some firearms, however, are not based on calibre, including many common military assault rifles:**


> _M-16 rifle_ (_an M-16_)
>
> _AK-47 rifle_ (_an AK-47_)


**When using specific names or models, make sure the designation is accurate** (e.g., the M-16 replaced the older, heavier M-14 as a combat rifle in the U.S. military in the late 1960s). Even widely known proper nouns can trip up reporters. For instance, there are many Kalashnikov assault rifles (AK-47s, AK-74s, AK-101s, etc.). The number 47 refers to the year that particular weapon was first manufactured (1947). Although new designs are now common, especially the AK-74 introduced in the 1970s, AK-47s are still made and used. **Unless you're sure about a specific model, it's generally best to use a general label that applies** (e.g., in this case, assault rifles, AK-series rifles, AKs, AK-47-like rifles).

**Abbreviations can be a source of errors**. Never assume you know what the letters mean. For instance, **AR in AR-15 does NOT stand for "assault rifle."** The initials represent the original manufacturer's name (Armalite Rifle). Colt later bought the rights to the assault-style firearm, and has made numerous modifications since, including production of a military-grade assault rifle we now know as the M-16.

**Shotguns are commonly identified by a bizarre calculation, known as gauge, that combines ammunition weight and the diameter of a firearm's barrel.** The figure was originally based on the number of lead balls of a certain size that would weigh exactly one pound. So a 12-gauge shotgun (accommodating 12 fictional balls of a given diameter) has a larger barrel than a 20-gauge (20 smaller balls, weighing the same amount). **A few shotguns are described by their "bore," which is equivalent to calibre** (e.g., .410 inches):


> _10-gauge shotgun_ (barrel's interior diameter is .775 inches)
>
> _28-gauge shotgun_ (barrel's interior diameter is .615 inches)
>
> _.410-bore shotgun_ (barrel's interior diameter is .410 inches)

**Missiles, mortars and other military words**
**Avoid loaded jargon. For instance, "smart weapon" is dumb propaganda.** If you want to describe a missile, **use a more neutral approach, such as "precision-guided."** But be sure your label is accurate (i.e., that the missile is guided by radar, heat sensors or some other technology).

**There are many types of missiles**, including intercontinental, medium-range, short-range, anti-tank, surface-to-air, air-to-surface and surface-to-surface. Ballistic missiles, which are guided only to the top of their arc, follow a normal ballistic trajectory (i.e., one based on gravity) when they come down.

**If you're unsure about military terminology, check don't guess. For writers covering combat stories, here are a few facts worth remembering:**

-   **Shells used in military weapons have a different meaning.** Although a shotgun shell refers to the casing that the pellets are stored in (see above), **an artillery shell is the actual projectile.**

-   A **volley** refers to several different weapons each firing a single shot simultaneously (or within seconds of each other). A **fusillade** refers to a series of shots fired from a single weapon over a short amount of time. This means that **one person can fire a fusillade but not a volley**. The concentrated discharge of weapons in battle or salute is also generally known as a **salvo**.

-   The term **artillery** describes large-calibre guns. Artillery weapons fire in **salvos**.

-   **Large naval and artillery guns fire shells**. Some combat weapons, including **bazookas, fire rockets**. Some aircraft can fire missiles, shoot guns or drop bombs. A howitzer is a type of cannon. **A cannon can be called a gun**, even though it shoots at a slower speed and with a higher trajectory. The word **cannon is both singular and plural** (a cannon, several cannon).

-   **Mortars lob bombs, also called shells, using very high trajectories.** A common mistake is to describe people being hit by mortars. In a mortar attack, **the shells are launched, not the mortars.**

-   **Tanks should be identified by name whenever possible** to avoid ambiguity (e.g., **Challenger 2, Leopard 2, M1 Abrams**), especially in stories focused on the weapons, themselves (e.g., buying new tanks, sending tanks overseas). The names can be shortened in second reference (e.g., five Challengers, four Leopards, three Abrams). Tanks are distinguished by a range of features, from physical size, speed and manoeuvrability to defensive armour and offensive gun power. Many military forces around the world now broadly classify this weaponry as **main battle tanks** (MBTs). While such terminology is OK, it's not mandatory. Alternative phrasing, such as **heavy battle tanks** can sometimes be more meaningful to our audience, depending on a given report's facts (e.g., the Soviet-era **T-72 tanks** being used by Ukraine in 2021 were slower and less powerful than the more heavily armoured **Leopard 2 tanks** donated to Kyiv by Canada and Germany in 2022, even though both were technically "main battle tanks"). If the abbreviation **MBTs** is included in stories, it should be spelled out once.

**Antique weapons may require slightly different wording** (e.g., old muskets fired balls not bullets, although some of these balls were actually flattened rather than round). **Never assume modern language applies.** For example, it's accurate to say that **giant Gatling guns from the U.S. Civil War era** were forerunners to the machine gun and rotary cannon. But they **required manually cranking cartridges through a firing chamber.** So while Gatling guns were spring-loaded, rapid-fire weapons, it's wrong to describe them as fully automatic.

### Weather words

**Weather words** 

**Avoid using language about weather loosely. Be clear and accurate.** Some of the most common meteorological (or in the case of tsunamis, seismological) terms in our journalism are:


[Category 1, Category 2](/home/w/weather-words#category), etc. (hurricane or typhoon)















[storm](/home/w/weather-words#windstorm) (windstorm)

[tornado](/home/w/weather-words#tornado) (EF-0, EF-3, etc.)







**air quality**
Since the mid-2010s, most government agencies in Canada have reported what's known as the **air quality health index (AQHI)** in a given location. It ranges from 1 (low risk) to 10+ (very high risk). Many other countries, including the U.S., however, continue to use a different, traditional measurement called the **air quality index (AQI)**, which ranges from 0 (very good) to 100+ (very poor) — peaking at 500. **Avoid confusing or misleading comparisons by wrongly implying that the two indexes are the same.** While both  take into account factors like smog (including ground ozone levels), fine particulate matters (e.g., smoke, dust, ash, pollen), etc., the AQI essentially highlights "the single worst pollutant" while the AQHI stresses "the sum of health risks" from each pollutant, according to this [Environment Canada summary](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/difference.html). In 2017, British Columbia introduced an index called **AQHI-Plus**, which it says better conveys danger from wildfire smoke. AQHI-Plus has since been adopted by several other provinces. Keep in mind that it's **often possible to avoid jargon by describing air quality in meaningful ways** (e.g., "very high health risk" or "avoid strenuous activity outdoors"), especially in broadcast scripts. Unless abbreviations are widely known (e.g., **CO2 levels**), shorthand should be spelled out and/or explained in first reference (e.g., "**PM2.5** measures fine particulate matter under 2.5 microns, which is roughly 30 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair").


**blizzard**
A major winter storm with strong winds (more than 40 km/h), temperatures of less than -10 C, and visibility less than half a kilometre. If the weather office issues a blizzard warning or refers to a storm as a blizzard, the word is fine. But if there's simply a big snowfall, don't automatically label the conditions a "blizzard."


**Category 1, Category 2, etc., storm**
These labels are commonly applied to [hurricanes and typhoons](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon). When reporting classifications (e.g., Category 1, Category 2), it's important to point out that sustained winds increase as the number rises. Since most people won't know the difference between one level of intensity and the next, it's helpful to provide the average wind range of the specific category mentioned in any story:


> **Category 1 hurricane:** sustained winds between **118 and 153 km/h**
>
> **Category 2 hurricane:** sustained winds between **154 and 177 km/h**
>
> **Category 3 hurricane:** sustained winds between **178 and 209 km/h**
>
> **Category 4 hurricane:** sustained winds between **210 and 249 km/h**
>
> **Category 5 hurricane:** sustained winds **over 250 km/h**


Note: CBCNews.ca capitalization style is: **Hurricane Katrina** but **Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane** (lowercase _h_ when not directly tied to the name).


**chinook**
A warm, dry wind (usually in the winter or early spring) that can raise temperatures by as much as 20 degrees Celsius within minutes and quickly melt snow. In Canada, chinooks are common in the Foothills of the Rockies in southern Alberta.


**cyclone**
A generic term that describes any severe windstorm rotating counterclockwise. In North America, the word cyclone is sometimes used as a synonym for [tornado](/home/w/weather-words#tornado) or windstorm. In the Indian Ocean, by contrast, it often means [hurricane](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon). Given the term's broad definition, it's usually best to avoid the word cyclone in news stories about stormy weather in North America. Instead, reserve cyclone for hurricane-force winds in the Indian Ocean. Note: CBCNews.ca capitalization style is: Cyclone Nargis but Nargis was the first cyclone she had seen (lowercase c when not directly tied to the name).


**dust devil**
A normally small **whirlwind**, common in dry areas, that whips up dirt, leaves, etc. They're caused by hot air rising from the ground into cooler layers above, and usually occur only in fair weather. The swirling upward movement of particles makes these whirlwinds look like tiny twisters. Dust devils range in size from small (less than a metre wide and a few metres high) to large (10 metres wide and hundreds of metres high). They're normally harmless, although big ones have enough strength to jostle cars. In rare cases, giant dust devils can rotate up to 100 km/h and threaten people and property.


**eye of the storm**
The expression refers to **the centre** of a fierce windstorm, _not_ to the most severe part. In fact, the eye of the storm is the deceptively calm low-pressure spot that high winds revolve around.

**flash flood**
Sudden flooding, usually caused by heavy rain or rapid melting.


**flurry**
A brief, light snowfall with small gusts of wind. The term "snow flurry" is redundant but idiomatic.


**gale**
See [wind speed](/home/w/weather-words#windspeed).


**gusts**
Sudden blasts of wind (e.g., during a thunderstorm), as opposed to sustained winds (e.g., during a hurricane). For many years, gust was treated as a noun only. But it's become a common and acceptable verb (e.g., "As the wind gusted, we rowed with even more gusto").


**humidex**
An approximate measure of how hot it feels during warm, sticky weather. The figures are based on the effects of humidity levels and temperature. **Avoid reporting humidex estimates as actual temperatures**, however, since the ratings are invented. Instead, treat them as optional, supplementary detail, along the lines of [wind chill estimates](/home/w/weather-words#windchill) during the winter. **Use qualifying language such as "feels like" to distinguish humidex calculations from logged temperatures.** For example: If the temperature is 26 C and the relative humidity is 80 per cent, it's OK to point out that the latter "makes it feel as hot as" 35 C, or to state that "the humidex is 35." But always provide actual thermometer readings, and never imply that a given humidex estimate is either a recorded or a forecast temperature. See [Environment Canada's humidex table](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fenvironment-climate-change%2Fservices%2Fseasonal-weather-hazards%2Fwarm-season-weather-hazards.html%23toc7&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0KKQq6Vd-z-WVQUagtL1nS) for more background on how and why the figures are calculated. Word buffs may be interested to know that the word "humidex" is Canadian. The term was coined by the Toronto Weather Office in 1965, according to lexicographer Katherine Barber's 2007 book, _Only in Canada, You Say_.


**hurricane or typhoon**
A tropical storm with winds more than 117 km/h. **Hurricanes** appear east of the international date line (usually reported in the Atlantic Ocean but sometimes in the eastern Pacific Ocean). **Typhoons** appear west of the international date line (always in the western Pacific Ocean). In the Indian Ocean, these fierce storms are generally called [cyclones](/home/w/weather-words#cyclone). In news stories, it's OK to use the widely accepted A, B, C names officially assigned to any storm during a given season (e.g., Hurricane Harvey and Typhoon Ketsana). But prefer genderless pronouns (it, its) rather than he/she or his/her when describing weather systems (e.g., "its damage" rather than "her damage"). The [Canadian Hurricane Centre](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ec.gc.ca%2Fouragans-hurricanes%2Fdefault.asp%3Flang%3DEn%26n%3DDA74FE64-1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw39Ro0-98_WarWpecSgLGqc) posts a wide range of information on its website, including data on the latest storms. The UN's [World Meteorological Organization](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmo.int%2Fpages%2Findex_en.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0BLezDEEQNzrJfa9y6FKvL) controls the official list of available names for hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.

Note: CBCNews.ca capitalization style is: **Hurricane Katrina** and **Typhoon Tip** but **Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane** and **Tip was the largest typhoon to hit in more than a century** (lowercase _h_ and _t_ when not directly tied to the name). See also [Category 1, Category 2](/home/w/weather-words#category), etc. for related guidelines.

**inversion**
This describes the opposite of what we'd expect with air temperature and height. Instead of decreasing, the temperature remains constant or increases at higher altitudes. Since most people don't know what an inversion is, it's better to describe the phenomenon with words ("unusually warm temperatures in the atmosphere"). Inversions can lead to numerous changes in weather, from thunderstorms to freezing rain. They can also trap layers of pollutants (smog) for extended periods.


**monsoon**
Technically, a monsoon refers to any major wind system that changes direction with the seasons because of temperature variations between large bodies of water and land. The term is most commonly used to describe the heavy and frequently destructive summer rainstorms in parts of the world. But it can also apply to cool, dry winds (e.g., in the winter in northwestern India).


**plow wind**
An intense blast of sinking air that fans out when it hits the ground, producing straight (rather than rotating) wind of up to 200 km/h that can cause severe damage. Plow winds, which often produce a loud roaring noise akin to tornadoes, are sometimes called "downbursts" by meteorologists. But avoid the colloquial synonym downburst for plow wind in news stories because it's often confused with heavy rain.


**rain**
Defined by meteorologists as "liquid water pellets larger than half a millimetre" to distinguish it from other forms of precipitation. The word rain on its own is instantly understood. Colloquial modifiers, however, are sometimes a source of debate. Environment Canada uses the following categories:


> **Very light rain:** Scattered droplets do not wet a surface.
>
> **Light rain:** More than a "trace" but less than 2.5 mm/hr.
>
> **Moderate rain:** Between 2.6 mm/hr and about 7 mm/hr.
>
> **Heavy rain:** More than 7 mm/hr.


**Rain is commonly measured in millimetres** in Canada, based on readings from cylindrical tubes inside special gauges. **Snow, by contrast, is commonly measured in centimetres** using special rulers. **While these units often suit our journalism, there's no rule against reporting rain in centimetres or snow in millimetres when it makes editorial sense.** The advantage of smaller units is precision, especially in hourly or daily totals. But **smaller units can become unwieldy in aggregate amounts**. In some contexts, for example, using millimetres could potentially distort total rainfall over months or years by making the accumulation seem bigger (e.g., 3,500 mm of rain instead of 350 cm). At the same time, using **larger units in some contexts can make sentences less conversational**, if not actually more challenging to grasp, especially in broadcast scripts (e.g., 0.3 cm of snow instead of three millimetres). See [metric versus imperial](/home/m/metric-versus-imperial#spellingout) for related guidelines.


**shower**
Brief rainfall, usually lasting less than 15 minutes.


**storm (windstorm)**
See [wind speed](/home/w/weather-words#windspeed).


**thunderstorm**
A thunderstorm includes rain and lightning. A **severe thunderstorm** includes strong and potentially damaging winds — with gusts of at least 60 km/h — along with heavy rain, frequent lightning and occasionally a tornado; hailstones are sometimes reported, too.


**tornado**
A violent rotating column of air with a funnel shape that touches the ground. It's also commonly called a **twister**. In Canada, an average of 80 tornadoes are reported each year. They're most common in southern Ontario, southeastern Quebec, Alberta and parts of the Prairies. A typical tornado begins as a rotation in a fierce thundercloud. It can rapidly and dangerously change. When it swirls past, a tornado often makes a ferocious roar. Unless the **funnel cloud** actually touches the ground, it's technically not a tornado. But it can still be accurately described as a twister.

Since weather officials often need time to review data to confirm whether a storm actually included one or more tornadoes, it's generally best to use qualifying language in early stories (e.g., "Witnesses said they saw a tornado" or "There was an unconfirmed report of a tornado"). Large thunderclouds can spawn several different twisters.

Report tornadoes using EF ratings (e.g., EF-1, EF-3), with a hyphen between the letters and figure. They're classified by sustained wind speed and assessed damage. Since April 2013, Environment Canada has used the "enhanced Fujita" (EF) scale, which replaced the original Fujita (F) system. The EF scale, created in 2007, is now also widely followed around the world.

Below are the approximate metric conversions. As with hurricanes/typhoons, it's important to define these ratings in news stories to make it clear that the higher the number, the more intense the storm:

> **EF-0 tornado:** sustained wind of **105 to 137 km/h** — light damage; some trees snapped or uprooted; garden sheds overturned; etc.
>
> **EF-1 tornado:** sustained wind of **138 to 178 km/h** — moderate damage; roofs blown off barns; mobile homes overturned; a lot of trees snapped or uprooted; garden sheds carried through air; etc.
>
> **EF-2 tornado:** sustained wind of **179 to 218 km/h** — considerable damage; roofs blown off well-built homes; barns and mobile homes destroyed; most trees in areas snapped or uprooted; electrical transmission towers collapsed; etc.
>
> **EF-3 tornado:** sustained wind of **219 to 266 km/h** — severe damage; most exterior walls of well-built homes collapsed; metal buildings and warehouses destroyed; grain bins carried through air; etc.
>
> **EF-4 tornado:** sustained wind of **267 to 322 km/h** — devastating damage; few walls, if any, of well-built homes left standing; significant damage to walls of low- to mid-rise buildings; etc.
>
> **EF-5 tornado:** sustained wind above **322 km/h** — incredible damage; houses lifted off foundations and carried away; objects the size of cars flying through the air; large brick or stone churches destroyed; etc.


Be cautious with historical references. For instance, do NOT simply change an old F-2 or F-3 rating to the new EF-2 or EF-3 system. The wind speed ranges of the old F scale are different. Instead, report the old measurement with context. This often means providing an acceptable conversion from a reputable source or comparing specific figures from two storms, such as sustained wind speeds.

Most tornadoes are classified as weak (EF-0 and EF-1), according to Environment Canada. Roughly seven per cent are EF-2 while about one per cent are EF-3. Less than one per cent are EF-4. Fewer than one in 1,000 are EF-5.

**tropical storm**
A strong weather system one step below a [hurricane or typhoon](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon) (with winds from 62 to 117 kilometres an hour). Note: The term tropical storm is considered generic. So CBCNews.ca capitalization style is: Hurricane Katrina and Typhoon Ketsana but tropical storm Noel.



**tsunami**
**Do _not_ refer to tsunamis as tidal waves**, since they have nothing to do with tides. **They're caused by underwater quakes or eruptions**. In the middle of the ocean, tsunamis may be only a metre or two high but they can travel hundreds of kilometres an hour. By the time the waves get near shore, they can be pushed up to a height of 25 metres or more by the rapidly rising sea bottom. A [CBCNews.ca feature](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fworld%2Fstory%2F2009%2F09%2F29%2Ff-tsunami-forces-of-nature.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2Mc4dMd2-67EGjJLEKg9gk) offers more background, including details about the massive tsunami that hit Southeast Asia on Dec. 26, 2004. Note: In its singular form, a tsunami is one series of long seismic ocean waves caused by a large displacement of water. In plural, tsunamis generally describe waves from different quakes (e.g., "Several tsunamis have hit the same area during the past six months").



**typhoon**
See [hurricane or typhoon](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon)


**waterspout**
A tornado-like cloud that forms over water or shorelines. It can be just as dangerous as a funnel cloud over land. Under the right conditions (generally cool and cloudy), waterspouts sometimes form even when there are no major storm systems nearby.


**whiteout**
Zero visibility caused by blowing snow, common during [blizzards](/home/w/weather-words#blizzard) in the Arctic and on the Prairies.


**wind chill index**
An approximate measure of how cold it feels during chilly, windy weather. The figures are based on the effects of wind velocity and low temperature on skin. **Avoid reporting wind chill estimates as actual temperatures**, however, since the ratings are invented. Instead, treat them as optional, supplementary detail along the lines of [humidex estimates](/home/w/weather-words#humidex) during the summer. **Use qualifying language such as "feels like" to distinguish wind chill effects from logged temperatures.** For example: If the temperature is –22 C, it's OK to point out that the wind "makes it feel as cold as" –31 C on a calm day, or to state that "the wind chill is –31." But always provide actual thermometer readings, and never imply that a given wind chill estimate is either a recorded or a forecast temperature. See [Environment Canada's wind chill index chart](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fenvironment-climate-change%2Fservices%2Fweather-health%2Fwind-chill-cold-weather%2Fwind-chill-index.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3HLp1s3gcDS5SIWW0Bq1ge) for more background on how and why the figures are calculated.


**wind direction**
The point-of-compass modifier (north, south, east, west) refers to **where the wind is coming from** (e.g., a **north wind blows from the north**, a south wind blows from the south). Generally reserve colloquial terms such as northeaster, sometimes written as **nor'easter** (a strong wind blowing from the northeast), and **northwester**, sometimes written as **nor'wester** (a strong wind blowing from the northwest), to directly transcribed quotes.


**wind speed**
Since most wind speeds are labelled generically and, so, are widely understood (e.g., a _light breeze_, a _gentle breeze_, a _moderate breeze_), they do not need to be defined (e.g., it's **unnecessary to specify official Beaufort scale classifications**, such as "a moderate breeze equals 21 to 29 km/h"). **Gale force readings, however, are worth putting into context** (i.e., a gale has winds of 62 to 74 km/h, while a strong gale has winds of 75 to 87 km/h). Any sustained wind greater than 87 km/h is a **storm**. The labels [hurricane, typhoon and cyclone](/home/w/weather-words#hurricanetyphoon) are applied to storms with sustained winds above 117 km/h — which is the same strength of some EF-0 [tornadoes](/home/w/weather-words#tornado).

### Western\_Canada

**Western Canada, western separatism**

[Western Canada](/home/w/western_canada#WC) (the West, the western provinces)

**Western Canada, the West, the western provinces**

**Western Canada** and **the West** conventionally mean **Canada's four western provinces** (B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba). The **West Coast refers to B.C.,** while the **Prairie provinces** colloquially stands for for **Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba**, even though the amount of actual "prairie" topography in each varies substantially.

Occasionally, Western Canada refers to parts of the North, too (e.g., past **Western Canada Summer Games** have includes Yukon, the N.W.T. and Nunavut). Usually, however, it means only the western provinces. Therefore, **always be clear when you're also referring to northern territories.** The simplest approach is to use expressions such as the "**western provinces and territories**" or specific proper nouns (e.g., B.C., Alberta and Yukon), depending on a given story's facts. For example" "Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and Yukon have agreed to co-ordinate efforts to stop invasive species such as zebra mussels from taking hold."

See also [regions of Canada](/home/r/regions-of-canada) for related guidelines, including why the name **Eastern Canada** can cause confusion because it's ambiguous.
See also [North, South, East, West](/home/n/north-south-east-and-west) for capitalization guidelines (proper nouns and proper noun equivalents versus compass points and various derivatives).


**western alienation, western separatism**

The terms **western alienation** and **western separatism** are entrenched in Canada. **Varying levels of discontentment have been voiced at different times, and in different parts of the West, since Confederation**. For example, some political leaders in B.C. threatened secession in the late 19th century because of delays completing the transcontinental railway. And since the 1980s, at least three different parties have advocated that B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba separate from the rest of Canada: **the Western Canada Concept, the Western Independence Party** and **the Western Block Party**. In the fall of 2019, the newly formed **Wexit Party** (short for the "Western Exit" Party) applied to Elections Canada to become federally registered. **Wexit Canada** advocates sovereignty for all four western provinces. Organizers have announced plans to field candidates in upcoming provincial elections under slightly different banners: **Wexit B.C., Wexit Alberta, Wexit Saskatchewan** and **Wexit Manitoba**.

Be aware that **labels such as "western alienation" and "western separatism" are sometimes used to mean only parts of Canada**. This is **an acceptable convention as long as stories provide suitable context** (e.g., when a report is primarily or solely focused on, say, Alberta or Saskatchewan). For instance:


> **[ANALYSIS | Does the West want out?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fcalgary%2Fwest-of-centre-alienation-kathleen-petty-1.5306529&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3JewfQhZtxw5vt-XRBiwby)**
> Not really, but the rallying cry needs to be heard
> **Western alienation** is hard to define but easy to feel
> Kathleen Petty, CBC News — Oct. 4, 2019

> > _There's been no end of headlines about **western alienation and separation**. While the sentiment exists across the Prairies, **Alberta is ground zero**, and it's the Alberta premier who has been chief among those sounding the alarm...._



> **[B.C. calls for unity as western alienation sentiments surge](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fbritish-columbia%2Fb-c-calls-for-unity-as-western-alienation-sentiments-surge-1.5332778&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0olwFK9o6tLI9nn4vPsE98)**
> CBC News — Oct. 23, 2019

> > _It didn't take long for #wexit, or "western exit," to start trending as Monday night's election results trickled in from east to west. Sending Justin Trudeau back to Ottawa as prime minister sent many Albertans trying to run for the exits with renewed separatist sentiments. But it's a conversation many British Columbians don't want any part of — including B.C.'s deputy premier...._


**Stories about regional political tensions require care**, especially when covering people or parties advocating outright separatism. Be fair and balanced. Report expressions of unhappiness , anger, etc., accurately and neutrally. Attribute opinion.

**In the case of the West, here are three caveats**:

-   **Avoid portraying "Western Canada" as monolithic.** Two Prairie provinces may passionately disagree over something that's not even on the radar of the West Coast.
-   **Specify relevant geographical context as required.** Shorthand like "the West" may be fine in a headline or lead, but if a story is mainly focused on one or two provinces we should make this clear early on.
-   **Avoid sensationalizing threats of separation.** Never imply a secessionist movement is wider spread than reliable evidence suggests (e.g., scientific polling).

### whisky

**whisky**

**In generic (lowercase) contexts always use the spelling "whisky,"** no matter where the alcoholic beverage was distilled. **The plural is whiskies.**

This spelling also applies to the common Canadian bird the **whisky jack**, also known as the [grey jay](/home/g/grey_jay). (The noun whisky jack is believed to be an English corruption of the original Cree word _weskuchanis_).

Some newsrooms recommend "whiskey" when specifically referring to Irish and American spirits. In 2007, CP adopted this approach — reserving "whisky" for Canadian and Scottish brands.

But CBC News prefers the well-established, simpler style (no "e") for all whisky because it:

-   provides consistency.
-   extends our practice of using only one spelling for generic terms (i.e., words that are not part of a proper noun).
-   avoids assuming a level of detail that may simply not be known in some cases (e.g., "She likes whisky" versus "She likes whiskey"). 

**scotch**
Prefer the word **scotch** on its own (short for scotch whisky): "He celebrated with a glass of 100-year-old scotch." Avoid the more formal and far less common construction "Scottish" whisky.

We treat scotch as a lowercase derivative, along the lines of: "She drank a manhattan while reading a note scrawled on manila paper found tucked inside an old novel bound in morocco leather." When specifying **Canadian whisky, American whisky** or **Irish whisky**, however, the adjectives require a capital letter because these words do not carry the same meaning on their own (i.e., people are commonly said "to drink scotch" but it's unheard of to sip "an irish" or to have a favourite "brand of american").

See also [wines and spirits](/home/w/wines_spirits) (Chardonnay. Kahlua but champagne, cognac) and [spelling](/home/s/spelling) (an overview) as well as [defence, labour and centre](/home/d/defence-labour-and-centre) for related guidelines.

### who versus whom

**Who versus whom**

**_Whom_ is a declining pronoun on a few levels. In a technical sense, the "decline" centres on turning _who_, the subjective form of the word, into _whom_, the objective form.** (The grammatical term _declension_ describes the alteration of a given word's suffix or other letters based on its relationship to a verb, preposition, etc.) **In a very real sense, however, whom's decline involves its lack of popularity.** People simply don't use it much in everyday speech and writing. And when we do use it, many of us misuse it — at least according to the traditional rules.

**The bad news** (for those of us who hesitate when typing who/whom, with our right index finger hovering uncertainly above the "m" key): **_Whom_ has not gone away entirely, and when called for in a sentence we need to use it correctly.**

**The good news: The decision is often pretty straightforward, as long as we've mastered the basics of boiling down bits of sentences into clauses.** (Clauses have their own subjects as well as verbs tied to those subjects.)

**The rest of this entry focuses on the fundamentals of using who/whom properly.** It includes examples of when the relic whom is absolutely necessary, when who is now considered more natural (and perfectly acceptable), and when the pronouns can simply be deleted without loss of meaning.




[Interrogatives](/home/w/who-versus-whom#interrogatives) (Who/Whom did he marry?)

Although some of rules below involve technical details (e.g., how to handle "copulas," also known as "linking verbs"), don't be intimidated by any of the jargon. If you're unfamiliar with labels such as "infinitives" or even with rudimentary grammar and syntax (e.g., subjects and objects), simply focus on the examples and draw as much direction as you can from those.


**Overview of 7 key rules**
**1\. Use who for subjects of clauses.** (A clause has its own subject and verb, such as "who eat properly" in the first example below.)


> People **who eat properly** tend to live longer.
>
> She said that everyone **who works with young children** should be vaccinated.


**2\. Use _whom_ for objects in clauses.**


> They don't know **whom the director picked** to write the report.
>
> Dorothy is the woman **whom we met last night**.


For details, see: [Clauses are king](/)

**3\. When a pronoun** (especially _whom_) **can be dropped without loss of meaning** (in what's known as a "zero relative" clause), **axe it**.


> Dorothy is the woman **whom** we met last night. (_Correct but lofty_)
>
> Dorothy is the woman we met last night. (_Shorter and more natural_)


**4\. _Whom_ can be the object of a verb as well as a "verbal"** (infinitive, participle).


> They wondered **whom the delegates would choose**.
>
> Anderson, **whom detectives called** the ringleader, faces three charges.
>
> The workers **whom you wanted to meet** cannot come until after 3 p.m.


But be careful to focus on the applicable clause. Don't be misled by distractions, such as dispensable words between the subject and its corresponding verb (e.g., "the judges feel" and "the police said" below):


> They wondered **who** (the judges feel) **danced the best**.
>
> Anderson, **who** (police said) **knew the victim**, faces three charges.


For details, see: [Verbs and 'verbals'](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs)
**
5\. Always pick _who_ when the pronoun is tied to a clause's linking verb** (e.g., _is, are_ or _am_), also known as a copula.


> They asked her **who** the best singer **is**.
>
> They want to find out **who** her secret admirers **are**.


For details on copulas, see: [Verbs and 'verbals'](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs)

**6\. Whom can also be the object of a preposition** (e.g., _to, in, from, against_).


> He's found someone **in whom** he can confide.
>
> The children, all **of whom** arrived late, were tired and hungry.


Note: _Whomever_ is a related pronoun governed by the same rules.


> **Whomever** she plays against will probably lose.
>
> Give the package to **whomever** you see first.


**But don't assume that the presence of a preposition automatically means _whom_ is correct.** In some cases, who is required based on the next clause (which the pronoun essentially begins).

> After the poker game, she was confused about **who** (_not whom_) **owed her money**.
>
> Give the book to **whoever** (not whomever) **answers the door**.


For details, see: [Prepositions](/home/w/who-versus-whom#prepositions)

**7\. Prefer _who_ over _whom_ in almost all interrogatives**, even when the objective case is technically correct. This is based on widely established convention, endorsed by numerous grammatical authorities:


> **Who** stole the cookies?
>
> **Who** is it?
>
> **Who** did you see?
>
> **Who** are they going with?


**Use the objective case in interrogatives only when grammatically correct and entrenched idiomatically** (e.g., such as immediately after a preposition):


> **With whom** are they going?


**In news stories, however, _whom_ tends to be overly formal and unnecessarily awkward in questions. It's generally better to rewrite.**

For details, see: [Interrogatives](/home/w/who-versus-whom#interrogatives) (Who/Whom did he marry?)

**The rest of these guidelines expand in a step-by-step way on the basic rules above.**


**Clauses are king**
**The first object when deciding between who and whom? Find the subject that applies to that part of the sentence (i.e., to the clause).** A clause has its own subject and verb. Unlike a complete sentence, however, it may not be meaningful on its own (i.e., without the rest of the sentence).


> People **who** eat properly tend to live longer. (_complete sentence_)
>
> "... **who eat properly** ..." (_clause the pronoun is in_)


Once you've nailed down the right clause, look for its subject. **The pronoun _who_ is a "subject," like _he_ and _she_.** This means it does something.


> **They** (_subject_) eat properly.
>
> **He** (_subject_) walks there.
>
> **She** (_subject_) runs there.
>
> Ron (_subject_), **who** (subject of clause) **goes there a lot**, was given a discount.


**The pronoun whom is an "object," like _him_ and _her_**. This means it has something done to it.


> It (_subject_) hit **him** (_object_).
>
> They (subject) smiled at **her** (_object_).
>
> It's pretty obvious who (_subject_) is kissing **whom** (_object_).
>
> Dorothy is the woman **whom** (_object of clause_) **we met last night**.


In the last example (about Dorothy), whom is the object of the verb _met_ in the clause "whom we met." It's comparable to _him_ and _her_.


> We (_subject of clause_) met **him** (_object of clause_).
>
> We (_subject of clause_) met **her** (_object of clause_).
>
> We (_subject of clause_) met **whom** (_object of clause_).


**Whom is the only relative pronoun in English that still declines** (i.e., that changes depending on whether it's subjective or objective). The others (_that_ and _which_) stay the same in all contexts.Personal pronouns, however, do have inflections (e.g., _they/them_). **And we can sometimes turn to these for useful direction on whether _who/whom_ is correct.** See the separate entry on [I versus me](/home/i/i-versus-me) for related guidelines on subjective versus objective personal pronouns.

**TIP 1:** When deciding whether to use _who_ or _whom_, **concentrate on the relevant clause** rather than the entire sentence. **Then in your head, substitute another pronoun**
(e.g., _he/him_ or _she/her_) to see whether the subjective or objective case is required.


> They're not sure **who** will play goalie.
>
> Relevant clause: "... who will play goalie."
>
> **He** will play goalie, _not_ "him will play."

> They're not sure **whom** the coach picked to play goalie.
>
> Relevant clause: " ... whom the coach picked to play goalie."
>
> (The coach picked **her** to play goalie, _not_ "picked she.")

**Verbs and ‘verbals'**
**The pronoun _whom_ can be the object of a standard verb as well as the object of what's known as a "verbal"** — which is a grammatical term for verbs that have "no finite form" (i.e., verbs that don't need to change just because a subject is, say, singular or plural or because the tense is past or present). Verbals include infinitives and participles, which often means they're either near a "to" or have an "ing" ending. Verbs and verbals are looked at more closely in separate sections below.


**Verbs**
Verbs are words that refer to actions (e.g., _see_) or states (e.g., _seem_). Many of them are classified as "finite." This simply means we face restrictions when using them. The common verb _am_ is an example. It has limited function in that form. ("I am here" is OK but "They am here" is not.) The word _like_ below is also a standard, finite verb:


> Colleagues **whom** we like are coming to the party.


In this sentence, _whom_ is the object of the verb _like_ in the clause "whom we like." The subject is we. Flipping around the words and picking a different pronoun (_him_) confirms that the objective choice is correct: "We like him" not "We like he."


**Axe unneeded pronouns ('zero relatives')**
Although grammatical, the above sentence is also a tad lofty. Whom tends to do that. **Depending on a given construction, the pronoun can sometimes be axed without any loss of meaning in what's sometimes called a "zero relative":**


> Colleagues we like are coming to the party.


**TIP 2: Before using whom, make sure the verb is actually performing an action on the pronoun** (e.g., "whom we like" but never "whom likes marmalade"). **In particular, watch out for common red herrings, such as other nearby pronouns and verbs** (e.g., "they thought" and "police said"). While these may initially appear to be the subject of the _who/whom_ clause, they're often just an inessential cluster of words between the clause's actual subject and verb/object:


> He gave you know **whom** (_NOT who_) a piece of his mind.
>
> **He gave** (you know) **whom** a piece of his mind.
>
> (He gave **her**, _not_ "he gave she.")
>
> They wondered **who** (_NOT whom_) the judges feel danced the best.
>
> They wondered **who** (the judges feel) **danced the best**.
>
> (**He** danced the best, _not_ "him danced the best.")
>
> They asked them **who** (_NOT whom_) they thought should win the competition.
>
> They asked them **who** (they thought) **should win the competition**.
>
> (**She** should win the competition, _not_ "her should win.")
>
> A warrant has been issued for Jones, **who** (_NOT whom_) police said is armed.
>
> A warrant has been issued for Jones, **who** (police said) **is armed**.
>
> (**He** is armed, _not_ "him is armed.")


**Linking verbs (be, is, are, am)**
Linking verbs (also known as copulas) sometimes confuse writers faced with the choice of who or whom. The rule, though, is simple: **Always pick the subjective case _who_ when the pronoun in question is tied to a "be" linking verb** such as _is_ or _are_:


> They don't know **who** the woman **is**.


Some people wrongly pick _whom_ because they recast the clause in their heads to produce "the woman is whom" (along the lines of "the woman is her" rather than "the woman is she"). But who is technically correct because of the job that the copular verb is performing. It's linking the subject _who_ to the object _the woman_ (along the lines of "she is the woman" rather than "her is the woman").

Grammarians label this sort of _who_ as the "complement of the copular." But the jargon doesn't matter. **The good news is that who not only looks and sounds more natural in such cases, it's also proper English.**

The most common linking verb is be, along with its cousins (_am, are, is_, etc.).


> They debated **who** the final contestants will **be**.
>
> They want to find out **who** her secret admirers **are**.
>
> They asked her **who** she thinks **is** the best singer.


In the third ("best singer") example, "she thinks" is a dispensable extra between the linking verb is and the correct pronoun, who, which serves as the subject of the clause "who is the best singer."


> They asked her **who is** the best singer.


The subjective case (who) is also the correct choice in this more natural construction:


> They asked her **who** the best singer **is**.


Authorities simplify the above "who rule" about linking verbs this way: Never use _whom_ with any form of the verb _to be_ unless that verb is in the infinitive. Although accurate, "to be" itself is an infinitive —which makes the rule's wording a tad confusing. Many writers find it easier to remember this version: **Use who when it's tied to _am, are, is_, and other forms of "be," but use _whom_ when it introduces the infinitive "to be."** (Infinitives are discussed in more detail under ['Verbals'](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs) below.)


> Ask the man **who** (we understand) **is** a police officer.
>
> Ask the man **who is** a police officer.
>
> We asked a man **whom** we understood **to be** a police officer.


**Keep in mind that _who_ is called for only if the linking verb applies to that pronoun.** Consider, for instance:


> It depends **who is backing whom**.


In this example, the linking verb _is_ governs the choice of the first pronoun: _Who_ is the subject of the clause "who is backing whom." By contrast, _whom_ is the object of the participle _backing_. (Participles are discussed in more detail in the next section.)


**'Verbals'**
Verbals such as the participle _meeting_ and the infinitive _to meet_ are not finite. This simply means they can be used in many different ways without the need to change form. ("I was _meeting_" and "They will be _meeting_" are both OK, even though one involves a singular subject in the past and the other a plural subject in the future. The verb _meet_, by contrast, is finite. It changes form — _met, meet, meets_ —depending on context.) **Verbals are also common acquaintances of whom:**


> The workers **whom** you wanted **to meet** cannot come until after 3 p.m.


In the above sentence, _whom_ is the object of the verbal (infinitive) _to meet_ in the clause "you wanted to meet." The subject is _you_. Flipping around the words and picking a different pronoun (_them_) confirms that the objective choice is correct: "You wanted to meet them" not "You wanted to meet they."

**This is another example of when the pronoun could actually be deleted,** as outlined in [zero relatives](/home/w/who-versus-whom#zerorelatives) above, making the sentence more conversational without taking away any key content:


> The workers you wanted to meet cannot come until after 3 p.m.


**Sometimes, whom acts as a kind of subject before an infinitive** (e.g., _to be_). But it's really just the object of the clause's verb, such as _took_ below:


> The person **whom we took to be** your doctor phoned for the tests.


In this sentence, _whom_ is the object of the verb _took_ in the clause "we took to be your doctor." The subject is _we_. Flipping around the words and picking a different pronoun (_her_) confirms that the objective choice is correct: "We took her to be your doctor" not "We took she to be your doctor."

Watch what happens, however, if we start fiddling a bit with our choice of verbs. _Took_ becomes _assume_, and the complementary infinitive to be turns into the [linking verb](/home/w/who-versus-whom#linkingverbs) _is_:


> The person **who** we assume **is** your doctor phoned for the tests.


**This variation highlights the importance of Tips 1 and 2 above, and the need to concentrate on the clause rather than the clutter.** _We_ is no longer the subject of the pronoun's clause. Indeed, the words "we assume" are merely qualifiers that could go elsewhere in the sentence:


> We assume the person **who** is your doctor phoned for the tests.


Picking a different pronoun (_she_) confirms that the subjective choice is correct: "She is your doctor" not "Her is your doctor." Even if a different clause is chosen (e.g., "who phoned for the tests") the subjective form remains right: "She phoned for the tests" not "Her phoned for the tests."

These examples are intended to illustrate rules about the pronouns _who_ and _whom_. **A good writer or editor, of course, would undoubtedly recast the original sentences for brevity and force, with no whom** (and perhaps no _who_) **in sight:**


> We assume your doctor is the one **who phoned for the tests**.
>
> We assume it was your doctor **who phoned for the tests**.
>
> We assume your doctor phoned for the tests.

**Prepositions**
**The pronoun _whom_ can also be the object of a preposition** (_to, with, from, in, against_, etc.). Prepositions are often directly in front of the pronoun in question and usually take the objective case (_whom_). Given well-worn expressions such as "for whom the bell tolls" and "to whom it may concern," **the correct choice frequently leaps out:**


> He's found someone **in whom** he can confide.
>
> (_He can confide in her, not "confide in she."_)
>
> The children, all **of whom** arrived late, were tired and hungry.
>
> (_All of them, not "all of they."_)


**Whomever is a related pronoun governed by the same rules:**


> **Whomever** she plays **against** will probably lose.
>
> (_She plays against them, not "against they."_)
>
> Give the package **to whomever** you see first.
>
> (_You see him or her first, not "you see he or she."_)


**But don't automatically assume that _whom_ is right** simply because it follows a preposition. **_Whom_ is required only if it's the object of the preposition:**


> After the poker game, she was confused **about who** owed her money.
>
> (_They owed her money, not "them owed her."_)
>
> Give the book **to whoever** answers the door.
>
> (_He or she answers the door, not "him or her answers."_)


In both examples above, the relative pronouns (_who_ and _whoever_) are the subjects of the verbs in relative clauses (_owed_ and _answers_, respectively).

Remember: **While _whom_ may be correct right after a preposition, sometimes the reason has nothing to do with the preposition itself.** The pronoun may simply be objective (_whom_) because it's the object of a verb in the clause after the preposition, as outlined in [verbs and 'verbals'](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs) above.


> In those days, many immigrants benefited from **whom they knew**.
>
> (They knew them, not "they knew they.")
>
> Claims that Canada is lax about **whom it lets** in the country are nonsense, the MP added.
>
> (It lets them in the country, not "it lets they.")
>
> They're concerned over **whom she will contact**.
>
> (She will contact him, not "she will contact he.")


**TIP 3: The objective form (whom) is generally correct after prepositions**, not because prepositions are inherently wed to _whom_ but because the pronoun in question tends to be the object of the preposition near it. **As with verbs, however, it's crucial to study the relevant clause within the sentence. That's how you spot exceptions**, such as:


> Today, some parents gauge their success based **on who** their children are.


**In this case, the preposition on is irrelevant.** The presence of are (a [linking verb](/home/w/who-versus-whom#linkingverbs), defined above) in the clause after the preposition is what really matters. And [the clause is king](/home/w/who-versus-whom#clauses). Put another, more technical way: The preposition _on_ positions the nominal clause "who their children are" within the sentence, but the linking verb are in that clause determines the choice of the subjective pronoun (_who_): "They are their children," not "them are."

See also [interrogatives](/home/w/who-versus-whom#interrogatives) below for handling whom as the object of prepositions used in questions (e.g., "Who did you go with?" versus "With whom did you go?").


**Interrogatives** (Who/Whom did he marry?)
Journalists know that how they phrase a question can affect the answer ("open" versus "closed" questions, "loaded" versus "neutral" questions, etc.). It's common sense. Over the centuries, many grammatical authorities have embraced their own common sense approach to the acceptable wording of questions — relegating the rather highfalutin _whom_ to the status of "rare exception."

**Mirroring the way most of us talk, we can now write _who_ instead of _whom_ in almost all direct questions**, even when the objective case is technically correct. This is sometimes referred to as the "interrogative who" rule:

**Subjective case** (_who_) **undisputed:**

> **Who** stole the cookies?
>
> **Who** made the soup?
>
> **Who** checked the locks?


**_Who_ undisputed with linking verbs** (e.g., _is_ and _are_):


> **Who** are you?
>
> **Who** is it?


**_Who_ fine, even though objective case** (whom) **preferred by some:**


> **Who** did he marry?
>
> **Who** have you seen?


**_Who_ OK when the object of a "stranded" preposition** (i.e., when a preposition such as _with_ or _to_ is somewhere else in the clause):


> **Who** are they going with?
>
> **Who** will she give it to?
>
> **Who** were you standing by?


**Use whom in questions only when grammatically correct and entrenched idiomatically**, such as immediately after a [preposition](/home/w/who-versus-whom#prepositions) (when the object of that preposition) or as a second pronoun in a clause immediately after a verb or [verbal](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs):


> **With whom** are they going?
>
> **To whom** did she give it?
>
> Who **hit whom** first?
>
> Who is **backing whom**?


**In news stories, the use of _whom_ in questions tends to be overly formal and unnecessarily awkward. It's generally better to rewrite.** In particular, almost always avoid _whom_ before a preposition:


> From **whom**?
>
> **Who** from? (_Acceptable and much more natural than "Whom from?"_)


In the case of indirect or paraphrased questions, continue to use whom when the objective form is grammatically required:

> He wondered **whom** she married.
>
> (_Objective case because the pronoun "whom" is the object of the verb "married" in the clause "whom she married."_)
>
> They're not sure who is supporting **whom**.
>
> (_Objective case because the pronoun "whom" is the object of the verbal "supporting" in the clause "who is supporting whom."_)
>
> They asked me **who** took the best photos.
>
> (_Subjective case because the pronoun "who" is the subject of the clause "who took the best photos."_)
>
> She wanted to ask **who** he was.
>
> (_Subjective case because the rule about linking verbs, such as "was" in the clause "who he was," applies._)

**7 common mistakes**

**1\. Failing to focus on the relevant clause:
**

> **WRONG**
>
> They're not sure who the coach picked to play goalie.
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> They're not sure **whom the coach picked** to play goalie.
>
> (_"The coach picked him," not "The coach picked he."_)


See: [Clauses are king](/home/w/who-versus-whom#clauses)

**2\. Using _who_ when the pronoun is actually the object of a verb:**


> **WRONG**
>
> They want to find out who hit who.
>
> He gave you know who a piece of his mind.
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> They want to find out **who hit whom**.
>
> **He gave** you know **whom** a piece of his mind.


See: [Verbs](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs)

**3\. Assuming _whom_ is correct because of a misleading nearby pronoun or verb:**

> **WRONG**
>
> They wondered whom the judges feel danced the best.
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> They wondered **who** the judges feel danced the best.
>
> (They wondered **who danced the best**.)


See: [Verbs and 'verbals'](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs)

**4\. Using whom with linking verbs (_be, is, are, am_):
**

> **WRONG**
>
> They don't know whom the woman is.
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> They don't know **who** the woman **is**.


See: [Linking verbs](/)

**5\. Assuming _whom_ always follows a preposition:**


> **WRONG**
>
> After the poker game, she was confused about whom owed her money.
>
> Give the book to whomever answers the door.
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> After the poker game, she was confused about **who owed her money**.
>
> (_"They owed her money," not "them owed her."_)
>
> Give the book to **whoever answers the door**.
>
> (_"He or she answers the door," not "him or her answers."_)


See: [Prepositions](/home/w/who-versus-whom#prepositions)

**6\. Assuming whom is needed in certain questions:**


> **WRONG**
>
> Whom are you?
>
> Whom did he marry?
>
> Whom have you seen?
>
> Whom are they going with?
>
> Whom will she give it to?
>
> **RIGHT**
>
> **Who** are you?
>
> **Who** did he marry?
>
> **Who** have you seen?
>
> **Who** are they going with?
>
> **Who** will she give it to?


For more details, including when whom is required in some questions (e.g., "From whom?" and "Who hit whom first?"), see: [Interrogatives](/home/w/who-versus-whom#interrogatives).

**7\. Failing to axe who/whom altogether when not required** (i.e., when a "[zero relative](/home/w/who-versus-whom#verbs)" is acceptable) in order to keep sentences in news stories crisp and clear:


> **WRONG**
>
> He's the man who they saw there.
>
> **TECHNICALLY OK**
>
> He's the man **whom** they saw there.


In the above example, _whom_ is the object of the verb saw in the clause, "They saw whom there." But it's also formal, rather awkward and completely unnecessary:

> **BEST (most natural) VERSION**
>
> He's the man they saw there.

### whos\_whens\_wheres\_whys

**Whos, whens, wheres, whys**

These are **rare but acceptable plural forms** that sometimes surface in idiomatic expressions, such as, "The wheres and whys of it all." There's **no need to add apostrophes because the words are not actually contractions**.

In this context, the unusual plural forms convey their own meanings. For example:

> whos = people or identities
>
> whens = timelines
>
> wheres = places
>
> whys = reasons

**The rest of this entry focuses on "who,"** which seems to cause the most headaches.

**Who's, whose, whosever and whos**

**Who's is a contraction for "who is."** It's a common singular construction, as in: "Who's driving the car?" It virtually never causes confusion in stories.

**Whose is possessive**, as in "Whose car is that?" Writing "who's" instead of "whose" for a possessive is a glaring and embarrassing blunder. A less obvious mistake is writing "whosever's" (wrong) instead of "whosever" (right) in possessive constructions. **The word "whosever" is not very common in journalism. But when it's used, the correct form has no punctuation**, as in: "Whosever car this is, it needs to be moved or towed."

**Whos is an unconventional term that means "people,"** as in "All of the you-know-whos will be there." **There is no apostrophe** because it's not a contraction. **While "whos" is a relatively rare plural, some of its cousins are far more common** (e.g., "whys" for "reasons" cited at the top of this entry). A few entrenched expressions feature such words, including: "The whys, wheres and hows of it all." An example from a 2017 news story:

> _The firefighter's response to a question was: "You don't want to get into the whos, whys or whens. It was just, 'Let's get out of this together.'"_

Put another way: The expression "whos, whys or whens" in the transcribed quote above is a colloquial way of saying the "identities" of people involved, the "reasons" something happened as well as other related details, such as the "timelines" of various events. Since these are NOT actually contractions for "who is" or "why is" or "when is," they should not be written as "who's, why's or when's."

**TIP: Certain plural constructions do require apostrophes because they feature incontestable contractions** (e.g., "The **dos and don'ts of driving**" really means "The dos and do not dos of driving"). When deciding whether to add the punctuation, recast the sentence slightly in your head to see if the word or words in question are functioning as plurals alone or as plural contractions.

### wines\_spirits

**Wines and spirits**

**Normally use initial caps for wine varieties named after specific grapes:**


> Bordeaux
> Burgundy
> Cabernet Sauvignon
> Chardonnay
> Malbec
> Merlot
> Pinot Noir
> Riesling
> Sauterne
> Zinfandel


The general rule is not whether a geographical name is involved but, rather, whether the wine's common name refers to a grape variety that, itself, is treated as a proper noun. Follow the Canadian Oxford Dictionary unless an exception appears in the CBC Language Guide.

**Normally use initial caps for liqueurs and related beverages that are proprietary. Otherwise, capitalize only proper noun elements**, such as a country's name:


> absinthe (lowercase)
> Bailey's Irish Cream but Irish cream (generic)
> Benedictine (English form; [no accents](/home/f/foreign-words))
> Cointreau
> Drambuie
> Frangelico
> Grand Marnier
> Kahlua (English form; [no accent](/home/f/foreign-words))
> vermouth (lowercase)


Again, Follow the Canadian Oxford Dictionary unless an exception appears in the CBC Language Guide.

**Use lowercase spellings for wines and spirits when these have become entrenched.** In some cases, proper noun elements retain initial caps (e.g., Kentucky in Kentucky bourbon):


> bourbon (generic) but Kentucky bourbon
> champagne
> cognac
> port
> rye
> scotch
> vodka


Such lowercase treatments reflect common usage and are preferred even when the original names are rooted in proper nouns. The word "port," for instance is not capitalized, regardless of the fortified wine's original ties to Porto, a Portuguese city.

**Be aware that some style manuals recommend a more complicated approach to wines and spirits**, distinguishing alcoholic beverages bottled in demarcated geographical places from similar beverages bottled elsewhere (e.g., a "Chianti" from a specific part of Tuscany versus a "chianti" from another region of Italy). But **we follow a more common and streamlined style** (uppercase Chianti across the board based on the grape variety).

**Overview**

Trusted wire services that the CBC subscribes to can be used to help stories in one of three ways, depending on existing contracts and individual editorial judgment:

1.  As a source of news only, read but not copied by us without substantial rewrite.
2.  As chunks of text that can either be lifted verbatim or rewritten to suit our needs, as long as appropriate credit is included at the bottom.
3.  As entire articles, cut or revised if required, as long as correct credit is included.

Everything we publish must also satisfy the corporation's overall journalistic standards, including accuracy, fairness, good taste and strictly controlled use of unnamed sources. Intentionally repeating another news service's work when we have any concerns about its content is unacceptable.

Acknowledging an external source's work (when we draw on key information from their reports), and crediting an external source's writing (when we use verbatim excerpts), helps reinforce honesty and transparency in our journalism.

All CBC News employees must clearly understand and follow the rules governing wire copy when rewriting, resembling or reproducing (i.e., copying) this material.

You can learn more about the agreements CBC News has with other broadcasters and news agencies, as well as what that means in terms of content use, [on this page from CBC Busines and Right](https://io.cbcrc.ca/?lang=en/#/resources/cbc-s-rights-agreements-with-other-broadcasters-and-news-agencies-1.3260230)s. If you have questions specific to your platform or program, please be in touch with your supervisor or the CBC Business and Rights contact on that page.


**When and how to use wire copy**

Reputable external news services can supplement CBC journalism without replacing or compromising it, as long as the material is used judiciously and correctly. In television, for instance, legally obtained video from syndication feeds and international partners can be added to video reports and newscasts.

Wire services that the CBC subscribes to, on the other hand, supply content written in a way that's often much more suited to the online world. Radio and video units frequently need to substantially revise such material to make it more conversational.

When broadcast scripts do appear on wire services, they are rarely publishable in their original form online because they're written for the ear not the eye. Even when spelled and punctuated properly, the text needs fleshing out (e.g., additional detail about a study's findings) or restructuring (e.g., a more direct lead) to work well on the internet.

This does not mean, however, that we should simply shovel wire copy onto our website. Whenever possible, we should take the time to blend original CBC elements into our stories to help set our journalism apart on the internet.

At its core, CBC.ca is the online division of Canada's public broadcaster. So to distinguish ourselves from the rest of the World Wide Web, we should showcase as much of the corporation's original journalism as possible and practical — and not just occasional scoops and lengthy investigative pieces.

For example, we can feature:

-   Colourful detail from daily CBC radio and video reports.
-   Transcribed clips from on-air interviews.
-   Additional facts from CBC producers or reporters (by phone or email).
-   Insightful context from veteran broadcast correspondents.
-   Extra information from people we interview on our own.

Truly adding value to our website is a far better investment of our time than heavily rewriting wire material and presenting virtually the same information in a different way.

Excerpts from wire copy are not needed when we have enough original CBC News content to post a good online article that offers our readers all key information as well as the desired amount of depth.

Excerpts from trusted wire copy should be considered when we have significant original CBC News content on any given story (as much as 50 per cent or more from the corporation's radio, television and online staff), but are missing some valuable elements available to us through CP, AP, or other "full rights" sources. A _"With files from"_ credit is required at the bottom of these articles.

Entire non-CBC.ca (external) bylined articles should be considered when we don't have much, if any, original CBC News coverage on any given story but still want to post a piece. Given the corporation's vast domestic newsgathering operation, this is more likely to apply to certain international stories.

We should never lock ourselves into a single approach. There may be times when we begin with a verbatim wire story and then, as the day progresses, replace this with a CBC bylined article that we think is better for our audience. There may also be times when we begin covering what initially appears to be major breaking news, and then decide to abandon our version and post verbatim wire copy instead because the story doesn't merit our full-time attention.

By incorporating wire copy we trust (along with either non-CBC bylines or proper _"With files from"_ credits, as the case may be), we clearly acknowledge the original source of external material while freeing our limited editorial resources to enhance current web content, as well as to update old stories and pursue new ones.

**Current rights**
**Here are more [details about the agreements CBC News has](https://io.cbcrc.ca/?lang=en/#/resources/cbc-s-rights-agreements-with-other-broadcasters-and-news-agencies-1.3260230) with other broadcasters and news agencies, as well as what that means in terms of content use.** If you have questions specific to your platform or program, please discuss with your supervisor or the CBC Business and Rights contact on that page.

**
Full rights**

**As a source of information**

**We can use information from full rights wire sources** when writing our own content from scratch unless we think the details might be wrong, legally problematic or in violation of existing CBC News standards.

**Attribution is unnecessary** when reported facts are peripheral, such as the height of a building or the model of an aircraft.

**Attribution is required**, however, when unverified information is central to a story (e.g., _Disciplinary action was taken against two other skating judges the same year but officials kept the suspensions quiet, according to The Associated Press_).

**_No "With files from"_ credit is given** at the bottom of such articles because the source was used for information only in a story written entirely by CBC online staff. A CBC byline appears at the top.


**Substantial rewrites
**

Writing from scratch does not mean changing the odd word. For example:

**Original**
_Riot police on horseback galloped through the shouting crowd, clubbing protesters trying to flee._

**Unacceptable rewrite**
_Riot police on horseback charged through the screaming crowd, hitting protesters trying to flee._

**Substantial, acceptable rewrite**
_Riot police on horseback used clubs to round up fleeing protesters._

In this case, the original wording contained more detail than either the unacceptable rewrite (we no longer know they were hit with clubs) or the OK but substantially shorter sentence (we no longer know the crowd was shouting).

Colourful descriptions can make our journalism more informative and engaging. So if an article from a news source we have full rights to features a lot of good writing, we may well want to incorporate the best content into our story verbatim (as long as a "With files from" credit is included, as outlined below). But never dump wire or partner copy into our own stories merely to make them longer. The key criterion is what serves our audience best.

****Quotes (public domain versus specific source)
****

Quotes in the public domain (e.g., comments from Question Period, from a scrum, from court testimony, from a news release, etc.) don't require a news source credit (e.g., "_I warned her to stay away," he sobbed during cross-examination;_ not _"I warned her to stay away," he sobbed during cross-examination, according to The Canadian Press)_.

This also applies to interviews conducted by specific news organizations (e.g., _"We can't sit back and wait for another 9/11," Anderson told NBC's Meet the Press;_ not _"We can't sit back and wait for another 9/11," Anderson told NBC's Meet the Press, The Associated Press reported Sunday_).

When quotes not in the public domain are taken from our "full rights" sources and pasted into CBC bylined articles, however, always add "With files from" credit at the bottom of the story (see next section).

**_'With files from'_ credit at bottom**

Verbatim excerpts from any full rights wire sources can be used in a CBC byline story (e.g., CBC News, CBC Sports, CBC Arts), as long as:

-   We have no reason to believe the details are wrong.
-   The content is not legally problematic.
-   The journalism meets overall CBC News standards.
-   A "_With files from_ \[specified source(s)\]" credit is included at the bottom of the story, with the full name of the source used (e.g., The Canadian Press not CP).
-   No less than 50 per cent of the story's content is written by CBC journalists.
-   The lead is written by CBC.
-   The added material is logically placed and helps rather than hinders the story's structure and flow.

More than one source can be listed at the bottom of the story. The brief but clear credit line should be in parentheses, italics and follow this format:

Example 1: (_With files from The Canadian Press_)

Example 2: (_With files from The Associated Press and Sports Network_)

When incorporating external material into our stories, we also have the right to revise the material slightly or substantially (i.e., we're not limited to verbatim excerpts).

When cutting and pasting quotes from material that we have full rights to, avoid adding specific credit to the wire service in the main body of our story (e.g., _"It's like cheating at solitaire," Jenkins said;_ not _"It's like cheating at solitaire," Jenkins told Canadian Press_). But be sure to include appropriate "With files from" credit at the bottom of the story.

If, however, a quote is attributed to a specific newspaper or other news agency, repeat this source in the story (e.g., _"We hope to pull the troops out by this fall," Woo told the Globe and Mail_). Provide an additional, general wire service credit at the bottom (e.g., _With files from The Canadian Press_) only if other material has been used (i.e., content in addition to the credited quote).

**Source byline at the top**

Entire articles from any of full rights sources can be published, either as is or revised (shortened, restructured or reworded) to suit our site, as long as:

-   We have no reason to believe the details are wrong.
-   The content is not legally problematic.
-   The journalism meets overall CBC News standards.
-   A source byline replaces the CBC byline at the top of the story.

Keep in mind that placelines, such as "TOKYO (AP) –," should be removed from wire copy to match overall CBC.ca style. Be certain, however, that the location is clearly indicated high up in each story (usually in the headline or lead).

We have the right to enhance such articles with photos, internal and external links, CBC audio and video, etc.


**Limited rights (source only)**

**Canadian Press 'local outs'**

We do not have full rights to CP stories branded as "local out," but we can treat them as a source of information.

CBC.ca is considered a single editorial entity in the eyes of CP, not a chain of local and national online sites. Since identical regional, national and international stories may be showcased on different CBC.ca web pages, the same wire copy and partnership rights rules must apply to all our journalism.

In Canadian cities with more than one newspaper, CP tends to protect members of its newsgathering co-operative by preventing papers in that market from reprinting a direct competitor's contribution. This is referred to as a "local out."

Such stories can be readily identified in iNEWS by warnings in bold at the top, such as:

-   HFX OUT HQQ
-   TOR OUT YYY
-   WPG OUT WQQ
-   CLG OUT CQQ

The source of the "local out" story generally appears in brackets at the bottom, such as:

-   (Halifax Daily News)
-   (Toronto Star)
-   (Winnipeg Free Press)
-   (Calgary Herald)

We can consult such material when writing our own content from scratch unless we think the details might be wrong, legally problematic or in violation of existing CBC News standards.

Substantial rewrites ([as defined above](/home/w/wire-copy#rewrites)) are required, and a CBC byline is used at the top. No "_With files from_" credit is given at the bottom.

Attribution is unnecessary when reported facts are peripheral, such as a crowd estimate.

Attribution is required, however, when unverified information is central to a story. Credit must be given to the newspaper that supplied CP with the "local out" story rather than to The Canadian Press itself (e.g., _A similar recommendation was dropped from the last study into ferry safety, according to the Vancouver Province_).

Quotes in the public domain (e.g., comments from a budget speech, from a scrum, from a news release, etc.) do not need attribution. Other quotes can be used but require clear credit to the specific member paper (e.g., _"Ottawa's offer is about as inviting as stew made out of manure," Stonechild told the Winnipeg Free Press_).

When there's a double credit given at the bottom of a "local out" article (i.e., the names of two newspapers appear because CP has blended material from two competitors to create a third story for clients outside the local community), do not use any quotes or other information requiring attribution unless it's possible to determine the exact source of that specific content (e.g., the Ottawa Citizen versus the Ottawa Sun). Verifying the specific source might require visiting a few newspapers' websites to see if the material in question has been posted there.


**No rights**

**General rules**

Nothing prevents us from looking at copyrighted material in the public domain (e.g., online articles on the websites of newspapers, other broadcasters, and so forth).

If we want to incorporate any of this content in our stories, however, clear credit must be given (e.g., _India won't decide whether to extradite the suspects for at least a month, Manmohan Singh told the BBC, because the evidence needs to be reviewed_).

Direct quotes can be republished as long as the source (newspaper, broadcaster, etc.) is acknowledged in the same paragraph. But all text needs to be substantially rewritten, as [defined above](/home/w/wire-copy#rewrites), and not merely credited.

Such material should be used only if:

-   We have no reason to believe the details are wrong.
-   The content is not legally problematic.
-   The journalism meets overall CBC News standards.
-   We have a strong editorial reason for drawing on a competitor's journalism.

The last bulleted point drives home the need to think about more than just copyright rules and accuracy when writing stories. It's illegal to post content we don't have rights to without crediting the source in the main body of the story. But it's also irresponsible and lazy to give other people credit for minor material that we could easily confirm ourselves (e.g., by making a quick phone call to, say, an RCMP detachment or a CBC bureau, or by scanning a court judgment or some other document).

**AFP**
Keep in mind that just because wire content appears in CBC's internal system (iNEWS) doesn't mean we have permission to use it on the web.

Unlike Radio-Canada.ca, for example, CBC.ca does not have rights to use daily stories from Agence France-Presse. We occasionally buy temporary privileges to cover special events.

Unless specifically told that we've purchased Agence France-Presse rights (e.g., for the Olympics), avoid adding any AFP wire copy to our journalism beyond directly attributed paraphrases of trusted and exclusive reports that we decide should be brought to our readers' attention (e.g., _The hijackers originally planned to land in Madrid but then ordered the pilot to fly to Germany, Spanish police told Agence France-Presse_).

Since the original content will be in French, make sure our translations are accurate.

Once Agence France-Presse information is verified by us — or by a wire service we trust and have full rights to use — the AFP credit can be dropped.

**Reminders**

**Accuracy first
**

The wire services CBC subscribes to are generally reliable. But just as we're fallible, they too make mistakes.

To maintain the integrity of CBC News, we must avoid publishing anything doubtful. If something from the wires is believed to be wrong or highly suspicious, leave it out.

If something newsworthy is merely uncorroborated (and if we have no reason to believe it's untrue), it can generally be responsibly published with attribution as long as it doesn't violate legal guidelines or CBC News standards.

In breaking news, details are often sketchy (e.g., the number of passengers on a hijacked plane) and frequently incomplete or quickly out of date (e.g., the number of victims killed in an explosion). When such key information is tentative or unconfirmed, attribution is essential (e.g., _The company refused to release details about the miners' condition, but The Associated Press reported Tuesday night that at least three of the men were alive_).

If there's a conflict between wire content and CBC reporters in the field, we should generally assume our corporation's own employees are right unless we're certain a mistake has been made in their coverage. In these cases, concerns should be forwarded to the national assignment desk.

Just because someone writes or phones to complain about our journalism doesn't mean we're wrong. But when we publish errors, we must correct them as quickly as possible.

**Writing the right lead**

As mentioned above, all stories with CBC bylines must feature leads written by us.

Deciding what is news, of course, is subjective — from choosing which stories to cover to selecting specific content (the focus, the people interviewed, the structure, the wording, and so forth).

When writing stories, we should keep an eye on the wires and on the competition, but we don't necessarily have to follow their approaches.

Whenever possible, we should also review relevant coverage from other CBC platforms and incorporate the finest elements of each medium's stories into our own online journalism (e.g., colour, context, transcribed clips).

Our editors must not automatically change a CBC writer's lead simply because AP or _World Report_ or _The National_ has picked a different focus. On the other hand, our writers must be able to justify their leads as superior when challenged by a CBC editor.

In the end, we should make informed decisions about coverage — including focus and content — based on our news judgment, our views about what best serves our readers, any applicable legal guidelines, and overall CBC journalistic standards and practices.

**If you have any questions about the use of wire copy, talk to your supervisor.**

### Workers

**Workers (versus Workers’) Compensation Board**

**The names of these organizations are different across the country. Follow the preference for each** province and territory:


> **Workers Compensation Board** (no apostrophe in P.E.I., Manitoba)
>
> **Workers' Compensation Board** (with apostrophe in Alberta, Saskatchewan, N.S., N.W.T. and Nunavut)
>
> **Workers' Compensation, Health and Safety Board** (Yukon)
>
> **WorkplaceNL**, formerly the Workers' Compensation Board (Newfoundland and Labrador)
>
> **WorkSafeBC**, formerly the Workers' Compensation Board (British Columbia)
>
> **WorkSafeNB**, formerly Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission (New Brunswick)
>
> **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board** (Ontario)

### World fair

**World’s fair**

**Keep the term world’s fair lowercase unless it’s part of the event’s official name, which is rare:
**
A world’s fair.
Several world’s fairs. (_plural_)
They went to the 1970 world’s fair in Japan.
They went to the 1964 New York World’s Fair. (_official name_)

**The abbreviated form of exhibition, however, is uppercase (Expo).** There is no hyphen or apostrophe before the year, which may be **two or four numbers depending on what organizers have chosen:**

They went to the Vancouver world’s fair in 1986.
They went to the 1986 Canadian World Exhibition. (_official name_)
They went to Expo 86. (_no apostrophe_)
Montreal’s world fair was held during Canada’s centennial celebrations.
They went to the 1967 Montreal world’s fair.
They went to Expo 67. (_no apostrophe_)
Germany’s Expo 2000.
Switzerland’s Expo 02.


**International Exhibitions Bureau**
**There are different types of world’s fairs** (some are larger and last longer).

**The sanctioning body that decides when and where they will be held is called the Bureau International des Expositions**, which was set up in 1928. In news stories, **call it the International Exhibitions Bureau.**

**Avoid using the official abbreviation (BIE)** in second reference. Instead, call it the exhibitions bureau, the bureau, the organization, the sanctioning body, etc.

The International Exhibitions Bureau offers a lot of background about world’s fairs on its website, including a [list of past events](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bie-paris.org%2Fsite%2Fen%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1CxBwH2ortqG2reKRIMPxr).

### wrongful conviction

**Wrongful conviction**

**Be careful when using this phrase.** If someone merely says they've been wrongfully convicted, attribution is required.

If a previous conviction is overturned, the adjective **"wrongful" applies only if new evidence shows that the original conviction was incorrect or if officials acknowledge that a mistake was made.
**

> Example: David Milgaard was convicted of the 1969 murder of Saskatoon nursing aide Gail Miller. In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial. The Crown decided not to prosecute again. While he was technically not acquitted, the government of Saskatchewan formally apologized to Milgaard. In 1999, he received $10 million in compensation for spending more than 20 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. New DNA evidence, meanwhile, led to the arrest and 1999 conviction of Larry Fisher for Miller's murder. A public inquiry was later ordered into Milgaard's wrongful conviction.


**If a conviction is overturned but the Crown simply decides not to retry an individual, the case should not automatically be classified as a "wrongful conviction."**

See the CBCNews.ca feature [Canada's wrongful convictions](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Fcanada-s-wrongful-convictions-1.783998&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0eGDmbg6Ezvh5R64yjKi7u) for more background.

**X**

**x** (_lowercase for unknown quantities_) "x amount of money"

**X** (_uppercase for a mark or a nickname_) "He signed the document with an X," "X marks the spot," "agent X" and "The mysterious Mr. X."

**[X](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/#Twitter "T")** ([formerly known as **Twitter**](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/#Twitter "T"))

**X'd out** (to cover a mistake with **x's**, as in XXXX or xxxxxx), **X'ing**, etc.

**X's and O's** (_tick-tack-toe_)  See [apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/apostrophes) for related guidelines on single letter plurals (p's and q's, the three Rs) versus other standard plurals of two or more letters (ABCs, FAQs, VIPs)

**X-Acto** ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for utility knives with small, sharp blades)

**Xbox** (a video game system made by Microsoft)

**X chromosome(s), Y chromosome(s)**

**Xerox ([trademark](/home/t/trade-names) for a photocopier)** _Do **not** use it as a verb._ Use copy or photocopy instead.

**_X-Files, The_** (television program) see [italics](/handy-links/punctuation/italics) and [The versus the](/home/t/the-versus-the)

**Xi Jinping** (became China's president in March 2013, replacing Hu Jintao) Xi Jinping is pronounced "[SHE jin-PING](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpronunc.cbcrc.ca%2FApps%2FLNG%2Frecherche%2Findex.aspx%3FProId%3D37152&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1d6lVJZj3b4vhF8eaBmuYE)." He's either **Xi** or **President Xi** in second reference. (See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names) for related guidelines)

**Xinhua News Agency** (**Xinhua** fine in first reference) The name stands for "New China." In stories identify it with a brief description, such as: " ... according to the official Chinese government news agency Xinhua." (See also [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names))

**Xinjiang** (China) Officially known as the **Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region**. The full name does not normally need to be spelled out in most stories. Xinjiang is a vast area of western China that borders Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and several other countries. It's home to about 12 million [Uyghurs](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/u/#Uyghurs "U"). **Avoid calling Xinjiang a "province."** Prefer nouns such as "region" and "area." In China, autonomous regions enjoy more administrative control than provinces. While both have local governments, legislators in autonomous regions are delegated broader local legislative powers under rules set by Beijing. Neither has the legal right to secede. Other examples of autonomous regions are [Tibet](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/t/#Tibet "T") and Inner Mongolia.

****

**Y** 

**[y-yn](/home/y#y)**

**[yo-yw](/home/y#yo)**

**y-yn**
**yahoo** (a coarse or backward person) The term, originally uppercase, was the name Jonathan Swift gave an imaginary race of people in Gulliver's Travels about 300 years ago.

**Yahoo** (_not_ Yahoo!) for the internet media company and web search engine. See [quirky capitalization](/home/q/quirky-capitalization) for relevant guidelines on writing words instead of logos.

**Yangon** (previously called "Rangoon") The commercial centre and former capital city of Myanmar, a country also known as Burma. See [**Myanmar**](/home/m/Myanmar) for guidelines.

**Yanukovych, Viktor** (Ukrainian politician)

**yard (prefix)**
yardage, yardmaster, yard sale, yardstick, yardwork


**yard (suffix)**
yard as a suffix is usually one word: backyard _but_ front yard, barnyard, churchyard, graveyard, jail yard, lumberyard, prison yard, schoolyard, shipyard

**yarmulke** (Yiddish term for skullcap) Many Jews in North America prefer the Hebrew term "[kippa](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/k/#kippa "K")," so it's generally best to use the word "**skullcap**" unless it's in a direct quote. See also [zucchetto](/home/z#zucchetto)

**yearlong** (see also [long as a suffix](/home/l#longsuffix))

**year-round** (hyphenated) Synonymous with "all year," as in: It's a year-round service. It's open year-round.

**Yellowhead Pass** (One of the main routes through the Canadian Rocky Mountains. It's west of Jasper, Alta., and includes a major highway and rail line.)

**Yellowknife** (capital of N.W.T.) Does not need territorial name after it, even in first reference. See [provinces and cities](/home/p/provinces-and-cities) for related guidelines; **Yellowknifer** (resident of Yellowknife); **the Yellowknifer** (newspaper); "Yellowknives" plural is correct in the proper noun: **Yellowknives Dene First Nation**. In second reference, their members are called Yellowknives Dene or Yellowknives. See also [Indigenous](/home/i/Indigenous) for related guidelines.

**yeti, yetis** (plural) Use this term when referring to stories about the abominable snowman of the Himalayas. See also guidelines on [sasquatch versus Bigfoot](/home/a#abominable).

**Yiddish** (Do _not_ refer to Jewish people as Yiddish, which is a language with roots in German. Many Jews speak Hebrew, which is a Semitic tongue more closely related to Arabic.)

**yin** (_not_ ying) and **yang**; also **yin-yang** (n.) **and yin-yang symbol**, etc. In Chinese philosophy, yin-yang refers to the harmonious interaction of the universe's passive female (yin) and active male (yang) forces. Do not confuse with yingyang (see below).

**yingyang** (slang for "a lot" or "to a large degree," as in "_They billed them up the yingyang for it._") This word is not likely to crop up much in our journalism. But when it does (e.g., in a directly transcribed quote), be sure to spell yingyang correctly. Do not mix it up with the Chinese philosophical term "yin-yang" (see above).

**YMCA** (Young Men's Christian Association) As with [YWCA](/home/y#YWCA), there's no need to spell out this initialism because it's well-known. (See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines)

**[y-yn](/home/y#y) - [yo-yw](/home/y#yo)**

**yo-yw**

**yogurt**

**Yom Kippur** (One of the most sacred days of the Jewish calendar, also known as the Day of Atonement. It's observed just over a week after the Jewish New Year, which is called **Rosh Hashanah**. Yom Kippur is marked by fasting and prayers of repentance.)


Young Offenders Act (_no apostrophe_) This federal legislation was replaced by the **Youth Criminal Justice Act** in April 2003. Avoid expressions such as "young offender" and "juvenile delinquent" to describe an accused. These labels imply guilt. Instead, prefer terms that presume innocence, such as youths, young people, young suspects, etc. When known, the specific age of the detained or charged person is better than a broad category such as "teen" — which doesn't actually apply to people 12 and under, and which technically also covers young adults (i.e., people who are 18 and 19). See [child, teen, young adult](/home/c/child_teen) for related guidelines.

**Yoon Suk Yeol** (elected president of South Korea in 2922) This is his preferred spelling, with no hyphens and initials caps in Suk Yeol. Refer to him as **Yoon** in second reference. (See [Asian names](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/a/asian-names/ "Asian names") for related guidelines)

**yours** (This possessive pronoun does not need an apostrophe) "Yours hasn't arrived yet," she told him before closing the door. See [possessive apostrophe](/handy-links/punctuation/possessive-apostrophe)

**Yousafzai, Malala** (Pakistani teenage activist born July 12, 1997) An outspoken advocate for women's education and other rights in Pakistan, she was shot in the head by the Taliban in October 2012 but survived. In early worldwide coverage of the story, Yousafzai was identified as a 14-year-old. But she was actually 15 when critically wounded. Although there are various spellings of her name, use the [transliteration](/home/t/transliterations) with only one "u" for consistency.

**YouTube** (See [social media](/home/s#socialmedia))

**yo-yo, yo-yos**

**[Yugoslavia](/home/b/balkans#Yugoslavia)** (A former communist federal republic that began breaking up in 1991 during violent ethnic fighting)

**[Yukon](/home/y/yukon)** (no abbreviation) Adding the definite article "the" is optional (i.e., **the Yukon**). For example, "She moved to Yukon"and "She moved to the Yukon" are both acceptable, based on entrenched local convention.

**yule, yuletide**

**yuppie** (_not_ yuppy), **yuppies** (plural) The colloquial term for "young urban professional" doesn't need to be spelled out, but it often conveys a derogatory tone so use with care.

**Yushchenko, Viktor** (Ukrainian politician)

**YWCA** (Young Women's Christian Association) As with [YMCA](/home/y#YMCA), there's no need to spell out this initialism because it's well-known. (See also [abbreviations](/home/a/abbreviations) for general guidelines)

### Yukon

**Yukon**

The **official name of the territory is Yukon.** But it's **OK to add a definite article ("the") when deemed more natural.** Be aware that "the Yukon" has become the entrenched preference of some in the North, and is often used by the territorial government, itself, outside of legal documents and other formal contexts.

**Examples of acceptable usage**, with Yukon as a noun:


> He's from the Yukon.
> She moved to Yukon in 2004.
> The capital of the Yukon is Whitehorse.
> The governments of Alberta, B.C. and Yukon oppose the proposal.
> Yukon's unemployment rate dropped slightly last month.
> He dismissed the figures for Yukon as unreliable.


**If Yukon functions as an adjective, "the" may be required because it's tied to other nouns**, such as delegation, company, government.


> The Yukon delegation left Monday.
> She bought the Yukon company in 2007.
> The study was paid for by the Yukon government.

**Background on** **'the' Yukon** (dropped, restored)
For years, "the" was placed before Yukon because it was tied to a compound noun that included the word territory (i.e., "the Yukon Territory," which was often shortened to "the Yukon"). **In April 2003, the territory's name was officially changed to Yukon.** For several years, "the" lingered — even on the territorial government's own website. Although the definite article gradually became less common, it remained popular in some circles.

**In August 2021, the territorial government voted to make "the Yukon" its preference outside of official documents** (e.g., in news releases but NOT in legislation, formal agreements). The [government's updated online style manual](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fguide.yukon.ca%2Fen%2Fcontent-and-design%2Fstyle-guide%2Fgovernment-references%2Fyukon-and-yukon&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pPTomFD29-6XN3npVBOax) said this change was "to recognize that for many people referring to 'the Yukon' is part of the territory’s unique culture." But the legal name of the territory remained Yukon. Therefore, even in speeches, public policy documents, etc., staff were advised to use wording that reflected an individual minister's choice. They were also told to respect known preferences of local governments, organizations, etc.

**Continue to add "the" to the Northwest Territories because the definite article remains part of the N.W.T. compound noun. But never add "the" to Nunavut**, which would be as jarring and inaccurate as writing "the Alberta" or "the Ontario."


**Miscellaneous**

-   Residents of Yukon are known as **Yukoners**.
-   Territorial leaders are now conventionally called premiers ("**Yukon Premier** Dennis Fentie says …"), a word once reserved for the heads of provincial governments.
-   Ottawa's official representative is known as the **Commissioner of Yukon**, although it's acceptable to recast as Yukon's Commissioner (as a title before the name) or as Yukon's commissioner (lowercase in a generic reference, along the lines of Ontario's lieutenant-governor).
-   **[Yukon time (YT)](/home/t/time#local) was established in 2020.** The territory no longer changes its clocks, effectively staying on permanent West Coast daylight time (i.e., YT = MST).
-   While technically a town, the name **Dawson City** is acceptable based on legislation as well as long-standing convention. But avoid the generic, lowercase term "city" in second reference. See [Dawson City](/home/d#DawsonCity) for more details.
-   While **Gwich'in** is the standard spelling for the northern [Indigenous people](/home/i/Indigenous), adopt the recognized variation (Gwitchin) if used in a proper noun ("the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of northern Yukon").

**Z**

**Zaire** (_It changed its name_ to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997.) **Call it "Congo, formerly known as Zaire,"** to differentiate it between another, smaller country in the region known as "the Republic of Congo." For other tips on avoiding confusion between these two separate states, see [Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville](/home/c/Congos).

**Zamboni** (A [trademark](/home/t/trade-names) name for a machine that resurfaces ice at arenas)

**Zamboni therapy** (use **MS therapy**) See [Zamboni therapy, so-called "liberation therapy"](/home/z/zamboni-liberation-ms-therapy) for details

**Zelenskyy, Volodymyr** (elected president of Ukraine in April 2019) There are numerous English spellings of his name, including "Zelenskiy," "Zelenskyi" and "Zelensky." See **[Ukrainian names](/home/u/ukrainian-names)** for general guidelines, as well as the specific reasons that **Zelenskyy** has been CBC's preference since July 2022..

**Zellers** (no apostrophe)

**Zen Buddhism** (no hyphen)

**zero, zeros** (plural noun) as in "There are a lot of zeros on that cheque," **but zeroes** (verb) as in "It zeroes in on the problem."

**Zhou Enlai** (formely spelled Chou En-lai) See [Asian names](/home/a/asian-names)

**zidovudine** (an [HIV/AIDS](/home/a/aids) drug, also called AZT) The term zidovudine is an arbitrary alteration of the chemical name azidothymidine, according to the Canadian Oxford. The former label is becoming more common than the latter, but neither term is well-known. In our stories, we must go beyond simply spelling nouns correctly. We must also make it clear what we're talking about.

**zigzag** (no hyphen)

**Zimbabwe**

**zine** (_not_ ‘zine), **zines** (plural) A colloquial term for small (often online) magazines. A lot of people are not familiar with the word, so _provide a definition if you use it_.

**Zinfandel** (can refer to either a specific variety of grape or to a type of wine made from that grape) See also [wines and spirits](/home/w/wines_spirits) for related guidelines

**Zion, Zionism, Zionist**

**zip code** (_not_ ZIP code) _Americans have zip codes, Canadians have postal codes._ The U.S. abbreviation stands for "zoning improvement plan," although it does not need to be spelled out in stories. The term is fine for addresses in the United States, but the generic term "postal code" works just as well and avoids any possible confusion.

**zip fastener, zip file** (compressed computer file), **zip line, zip wire**

**zipper** (capital Z no longer needed because the [trademark](/home/t/trade-names) has become a generic term)

**zodiac, signs of the zodiac** (lowercase)


**zombie deer disease** (OK in first reference, including headlines) This is a common and acceptable colloquialism for a type of **chronic wasting disease (CWD)**. To keep our journalism clear, however, the formal name (CWD) should be used at least once in stories whenever practical, in the same way we approach [mad cow disease](https://language-guide.cbcrc.ca/home/m/mad-cow-disease/ "Mad cow disease") (BSE). Using quotation marks to flag "zombie deer disease" as an informal label is fine but optional. Be aware that CWD falls under the larger heading of **transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)**, an umbrella category of incurable, fatal brain diseases that can affect people, cattle, sheep, deer and other animals.

**zone (ending a compound noun)**
**danger zone, disaster zone, flood zone, time zone**, etc. (two words)

**zucchetto, zucchettos** (Caps worn by the Roman Catholic clergy) There are different colours: black for priests, purple for bishops, red for cardinals and white for the Pope. The term skullcap is more widely understood and, so, generally a better choice. See also [yarmulke](/home/y#yarmulke).

**zucchini**

### Zamboni liberation MS therapy

**Zamboni therapy, so-called 'liberation therapy'**

In first reference (including headlines and TV supers), use neutral, descriptive and meaningful phrases, such as: **MS vein therapy, MS vein treatment**, or even **MS therapy**. The medical term, _venous angioplasty_, is too technical unless defined. An alternative phrase, such as **angioplasty for people with MS**, is fine, as long as the context makes the meaning clear, especially since many people associate angioplasty with the heart.

Words like _therapy_ and _treatment_ are vague, of course, so our journalism should always include details about what's actually involved (see below). If we call it **Zamboni therapy** in a later reference, be sure to point out that the treatment was pioneered by Paolo Zamboni, an Italian doctor.

**The procedure is controversial.** It's based on a theory that narrowed neck veins cause blood-borne iron deposits to build up and damage brain cells, and that unblocking the veins will help people with multiple sclerosis. But some researchers have challenged the validity of the preliminary research.

**There's no need to use jargon to tell our stories.** Zamboni, for instance, named the condition "chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency," or CCSVI. We, however, should stick with something understandable (e.g., "clogged neck veins").

If there's room in a story, it's fine to point out that advocates call the procedure "liberation therapy." This might be particularly important in our web journalism where the use of certain keywords can help get our material to a wider audience because of how search engines work. But it's not a neutral noun and, so, requires either attribution or the qualifier so-called (i.e., **so-called "liberation therapy"**).
